polylactic acid konno ive heard importing grain konno supermarket plastic bag recently importing water used overseas hope unitikas become widely covered environmental issue japan technology spread developing country think would good disposable plastic item like besides china made terramac would economically feasible japan generated lot ohnishi one area working getting environmentally harmful pollution think municipality japan switch garbage bag duty play leading role providing distribute terramac bag think theyll cost guidance conventional garbage bag think people going become aware ohnishi human economic activity cost needed environmental ultimately destructive activity think preservation destruction accumulated year led global unitika successful track environmental problem record providing water today problem may treatment technology china dont feel need worry today tomorrow next day ohnishi type work today problem continue unabated role goodwill ambassador consequence severe united nation development konno un working programme prevent happening konno year observe un japan generated lot development programme project environmentally harmful pollution developing country help publicize high growth era think duty play work august year went cambodia cambodia leading role providing guidance neighboring rival vietnam speed growth developing country dont make
