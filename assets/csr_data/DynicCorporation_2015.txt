challenge belief responsibility manufacturer observe domestic overseas law regulation related environment provide product less environ mental burden market implement concept specific manner thoroughly promote following item stage including development material procurement manufacturing sale distribution disposal reduce environmental burden stage business activity throughout life cycle product proactively make effort save energy reduce waste thereby preventing environ mental contamination prevent risk caused harmful chemical substance damage environment disclose information regarding business activity related environment proactively promote environment preservation activity acting concert local com munities implement education related environmental preservation thereby improving awareness environment yoshio oishi president dynic corporation effort reducing environmental burden introducing manufacturing method feature less energy burden implement ing product design resource saving longer service life taken consideration addition consider material feature less environmental burden material easy recycle design phase product manufacturing phase make effort save energy reduce waste manufacturing scene every day thereby contributing reduction environ mental burden marketing phase propose environmentally friendly product reduce environmental burden customer using product thereby making effort contribute environmental preservation earth effort countermeasure global warming biodiversity conservation promoting countermeasure global warming effort energysaving activity throughout dynic thereby reducing emission carbon dioxide addition regarding biodi versity conservation making effort toward coexistence global environment activity toward risk including
