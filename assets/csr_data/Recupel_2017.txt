recupel annual report world best urban miner intro awareness raising collection result collection network recycling figure annual balance sheet member satisfaction intro reason recupel shifted higher circular gear become sheer necessity society take path circular economy recupel noted celebrated th birthday growing mountain waste increasing scarcity raw material nature circular economy urban mining longer optional ceo peter sabbe concluded recupels th birthday party theyve become necessity raw material extract electrical electronic waste longer taken earth fastest growing type waste world every year electronic waste grows another rate make fastest growing type waste world worldwide around million tonne electronic waste generated calculated global ewaste monitor united nation ie around kg every inhabitant planet hazardous substance remain present however hazardous substance often integrated many device testaankoop recalled pipe refrigerator contain gas highly dangerous washing machine sometimes contain toxic pcbs screen old tv almost always contain heavy metal vitally important let substance get away proper removal processing recycling ie depollution thus enormous value raw material scarcity addition also becoming economically ever important recover many element outdated electronics possible metal cobalt cadmium example primarily found mine congo zambia extracted dubious circumstance without concern environmental impact metal gold silver copper also increasingly difficult extract yet found easily accessible many electronic device scarcity felt even strongly increased importance electrorecycling invisible kilo according recent figure every belgian generates kg electrical electronic waste annual basis meantime almost half around kg properly collected recupel network reuse recycling kg thus guaranteed end somewhere africa asia testaankoop describes people attempt rudimentary way collect valuable electronic component attendant consequence health environment thus important better map still invisible kilo order able guarantee properly collected recycled well brief reason enough recupel shift higher gear collect electrical electronic equipment ever combining expansion collection network recupel targeted campaign lamp small electrical appliance taught right habit significant group belgian say sabbe dont throw electrical electronic waste away bring u urban mining longer option become necessity awareness raising belgian became aware ever importance urban mining thing like action raise awareness student new website two largescale medium campaign increase number store become collection point active pr component recupel able make belgian aware ever increasing importance proper collection reprocessing electrical electronic waste begin work done positioning recupel area public relation public affair intention leveraging name recognition highlighting organisation social importance accomplish recupel joined force many organisation institution shown interest associated recycling urban mining circular economy proper understanding ewaste problematic activity recupel many stakeholder possible great importance guaranteeing positive evolution recupels activity concrete result increased attention medium relation already sharp increase number newspaper article radio interview tv report devoting attention recupels important role electrorecycling belgium café recupel order specifically raise awareness belgian student population recupel opened café recupel action student get chance bring electrical electronic waste easily accessible way collaborated intensively recycling shop intermunicipal utility company mentioned communication event present site order check device brought reuse potential thus six cafés organised distributed across country three region apart collection old electrical electronic equipment initiative also generated good deal medium attention recupels new website addition recupels new website launched elaborated basic platform recupels contact consumer company coming year moreover channel receiving important role external communication digital communication effort already recognised digital marketing award nonprofit category like organisation recupel digitising aspect operation ensures greater efficiency also requires certain vigilance context recupel decided ethical hacking conducted system test successfully concluded finally appears collection figure medium campaign focusing small electrical electronic device lamp also well worth effort use head lamp lady campaign measurable effect significantly reinforced combination expansion recyclepoints recognisable collection point visible location store chain retail look tonnage almost small electrical electronic device collected lamp preceding year quantity collected equipment went respectively collection point campaign lifted quantity collected small electrical electronic device collection result million discarded device found way reuse recycling recupel collected electrical electronic equipment ever thus staying head electrorecycling pack europe kg per inhabitant collected total million device cord attached

collected big white cooling freezing appliance showed unmistakeable increase collection lamp small electrical electronic device success quantity collected piece latter rose respectively category among small electrical electronic device rapidly rising type electrical electronic waste recupel expects trend continue coming year therefore continue focus collection small electrical electronic equipment evolution electrical electronic equipment collected recupel per fraction sind de oprichting van recupel jaar geleden werden overigens al toestellen ingezameld saman goed voor meer dan miljoen ton zo werd naar aanleiding van het jubileum berekend cijfers die de miljoen toestellen van nog extra glans geven market put market put market pom v market via recupel oom meantime belgium volume electrical electronic device put market pom find way market oom via recupel system make country amongst efficient world however member state european union obliged collect volume electrical electronic device put market reuse recycling naturally recupel therefore continue promote collection say recupel ceo peter sabbe together social player also want better map ewaste flow coming year electrical electronic device moment taken market via recupel today pretty good idea happens example reported individual plan mixed scrap waste leaf belgium via legal illegal export however idea remaining end study conducted collaboration united nation university showed belgium year kg electrical electronic waste generated per inhabitant kg officially collected registered kg documented nothing known remaining kilo thus remains top priority coming year well get better view together government authority distribution sector producer recyclers peter sabbe concludes moreover fact still much room growth area collection old electrical electronic equipment highlighted numerous message circulated social medium thanks recupel average flemish family electronic appliance home ranging refrigerator clothes iron

recyclepoints passed threshold active recyclepoints throughout belgium also used ever intensively study showed consumer find recyclepoints good supplement recycling park expansion recyclepoint network led increase number pickup per month recent figure demonstrate recyclepoints caused quantity collected small electrical electronic device increase several thousand tonne compared previous year one mustnt forget recyclepoints introduced end already distributed throughout country thus term collection network belgium confidently toss hat ring title world best urban miner also term collection network belgium confidently compete title world best urban miner recycling figure recycled electrical electronic equipment good tonne raw material recupel may justifiably call belgian urban mining expert old electrical electronic equipment term collection also regard processing ewaste new raw material collected device first depolluted recupelcertified recyclers freed harmful substance optimally processed new raw material process vital link circular economy way average electrical electronic device becomes new raw material thus total tonne raw material could used production new device raw
