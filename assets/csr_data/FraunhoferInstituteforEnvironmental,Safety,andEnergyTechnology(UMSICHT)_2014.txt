unsere stakeholder sind einen internen dialog haben wir im januar mit einer auswahl unserer belegschaft durchgeführt und können damit die wesentlichen berichtsinhalte bestimmen wir danken allen beteiligten für ihr engagement bei der erstellung diesis berichts haben wir wieder festgestellt da der weg zu einer nachhaltigen entwicklung für unser institut ein fortlaufender prozess ist und da wir
