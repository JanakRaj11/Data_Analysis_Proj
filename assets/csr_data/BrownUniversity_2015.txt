diversion greenhouse gas ghg emission reduction energy efficiency program continues flagship sustainability program challenge past year coldest winter record resulting increased heating energy demand although conservation effort allowed brown actually decrease energy use previous fiscal year cold winter played significant role increase primarily new england electricity grid utilized carbon
