present excellent figure climate environmental benefit depollution recupel approved partner made sure tonne harmful substance old battery compressor cathode ray tube etc end environment number still tonne decrease attributed trend electrical electronic appliance contain less less harmful substance addition mechanical processing processor also continued invest manual depollution result even thorough depollution emission reduction thanks training course epositive driving co² emission could reduced tonne logistics number superfluous kilometre reduced see also link optiweee emission also reduced vehicle fleet average emission company car fall gkm gkm training course epositive driving produced result consumption dropped equivalent annual saving litre fuel tonne co² raw material balance
