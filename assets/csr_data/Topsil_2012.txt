today among world leading enterprise development production ultrapure silicon addressing power market selected niche market semiconductor industry end topsils market worth slightly dkk billion according independent industry analyst yole developpement power market target mainly energy transport industrial medical telecommunication sector characterised high high medium high voltage component manufacture ultrapure silicon extremely complex therefore handful company world supply including topsil topsils ultrapure silicon used raw material component used conducting controlling electricity one point another minimum loss power silicon sold wafer used eg highspeed train wind turbine industrial motor control power grid today three quarter topsils product end clean tech application may defined product involved energy saving energy efficiency driven globally increasing energy consumption increasing investment transport energy control power market seen good growth rate recent year yole developpement foresees market growth continue year come especially within medium voltage segment despite overall favourable trend however impacted change political focus major economy driven ongoing financials challenge resulting pronounced caution concerning new investment since foundation topsil located denmark hq polish subsidiary cemat acquired cemat specialises manufacturing silicon less purity topsil medium low voltage level furthermore equipment expertise necessary conduct silicon wafering enabled topsil transfer previously externally conducted activity cemat new plant cleantech park order accommodate overall favourable market trend meet customer demand product development steadily tighter quality limit lower cost shorter lead time topsil building new future proof facility copenhagen cleantech park close existing headquarters construction completed new plant include number environmentally sound solution addition boosting capacity enabling larger diameter wafer supporting topsils entry additional market among others new location serf statement topsils progressing commitment environment clean technology energy effectiveness construction phase new plant
