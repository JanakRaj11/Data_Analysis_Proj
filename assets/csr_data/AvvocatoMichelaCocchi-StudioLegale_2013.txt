si facciano dicano più che alcun altra e cioè fuggir quanto più si po e come un asperissimo e pericoloso scoglio la affettazione e per dir forse una nova parola usar ogni cosa una certa sprezzatura che nasconda larte e dimostri ciò che si fa e dice venir fatto senza fatica e quasi senza pensarvi da questo credo io che derivi assai la grazia perché delle cose rare e ben fatte ognun sa la difficultà onde esse la facilità genus grandissima maraviglia e per lo contrario il sforzare e come si dice tirar per capegli dà somma disgrazia e fa estimar poco ogni cosa per grande chella si sia
