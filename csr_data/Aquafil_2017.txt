how the infinite yarn is born

for four years aquafil has adopted the
lifecycle methodology for measuring
the environmental performance of its
products and identifying the stages
of the production process on which
there is more room for improvement
this approach has made it clear nylon
yarns biggest impact is that it is made
up of raw materials this has led to
the development of the econyl
production system which replaces the
raw material of nonrenewable origin
with secondary raw material coming
from various recycled waste including
endoflife fishing nets carpet fluff
and others




 fluff is the top part of the carpet that occurs at the
end of its life cycle

service suppliers for the production and marketing of econyl products
