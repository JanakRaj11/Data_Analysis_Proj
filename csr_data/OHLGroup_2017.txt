4   letter from the chairman




                                                         letter from the
                                                         chairman

               ladies and gentlemen

               2016 has been a financial year of poor results for the ohl group strongly
               influenced by the impact of the full recognition of the losses in a number of
               older projects referred to internally as legacy projects and by the adverse
               exchange rate trend in the currencies of the countries in which the group
               carries out its business activity

               on the operating level the income statement has been influenced to a large
               extent by both factors which have led to losses amounting to 432 million euros
               the normalized income statement without taking into account the influence of
               the results expected from these older projects and at a constant exchange rate
               would have shown a net profit of 248 million euros four times more than the
               profit obtained in 2015 which totaled 57 million euros

               despite these adverse results and following the measures taken in the financial
               sphere the 2016 financial year has left a sound and reinforced balance sheet
               that constitutes a solid base on which to build the companys future

               in this context regaining the confidence of our rating agencies has been
               established as a priority objective for ohl in 2017 the group trusts that
               the debtreduction measures taken the sound and profitable model of the
               construction business once the impact of the older projects has been absorbed
               and the strength of the liquidity position following the agreement with ohls
               reference banks will make it possible to reach a recourse leveraging ratio at
               the end of 2017 of less than 1 an aspect which is expected to bring about a
               positive impact on the rating

                                                                    letter from the chairman   5

principal milestones of the financial year in economic terms

   final elimination of the impact of the legacy projects on the results and
    the curtailing of their impact on the cash flow at the close of accounts
    for the year a revision of the final targets for these projects was made that
    has translated into lower figures for ebitda and for the result of entities
    accounted for by the equity method totaling 520 million and 149 million
    euros respectively with this situation resolved ohl will be able to center
    on the management of the rest of the construction business now on sound
    footing and producing a positive cash flow on a sustainable basis

   successful rotation of assets with capital gains in all cases that activity
    which is a part of the companys ordinary course of business has enabled
    debt reduction and the simplification of ohls financial structure this
    rotation has involved divestitures totaling 16 billion euros in 2016 and
    627 million in the first two months of 2017 and has led to a net result of
    330 million euros in 2016 moreover in the first two months of 2017 an
    additional amount of approximately 100 million euros has been obtained
    following the recent divestiture of the 25 stake in abertis and the partial
    divestiture of the mayakoba and canalejas assets

   excellent performance of the concessions division where sales and
    ebitda from tolls at a constant exchange rate and excluding the effect
    of the change in the consolidation method of metro ligero oeste grew
    117 and 205 respectively and where the concessions in mexico with
    growth figures in local currency of 147 and 148 respectively stand
    out particularly

    the division has initiated a process for incorporating new partners during
    this financial year up to a total of 49 into its greenfield assets vespucio
    oriente puente industrial río magdalena nogalespuchuncaví and
    puerto valparaíso this incorporation would cut the equity contributions
    by approximately half and according to current estimates these would then
    be reduced to 146 million euros delivering a cash inflow of approximately
    116 million euros corresponding to the proportionate part of the equity
    already contributed to these projects at the close of accounts for 2016

   complete elimination of trigger risk following the sale of the 4425
    stake in abertis on october 3 2016 the process was completed for the
    elimination of all of the borrowings with trigger risk which at the start of
    2015 totaled 15 billion euros




                                                the ohl group maintains

60   strategy and business model


                owens lake
                the owens lake contract awarded by the los angeles department of water and
                power ladwp is the largest project obtained by the ohl group in california to
                date the scope of the contract encompasses the secondtolast phase of the project
                designed to mitigate the dust emissions from owens lake which extends over an area
                of 938 hectares of the lake playa and is located at a distance of 160 kilometers from
                the city of los angeles




                at the start of the 20th century the city of los angeles acquired the majority of the
                water rights in the owens valley for the purpose of building the los angeles aqueduct
                the water from owens lake was diverted to the aqueduct and as a result the lake
                dried up in 1926 the desiccation of the lake gave rise to the crystallization of the
                minerals and salts generating a crust of alkaline salt that still today covers a large part
                of the lake bed the effects of the heavy winds on this saline crust have given rise to a
                source of dust and air pollution in the area causing a serious public health problem
                and a strong ecological impact

                the ladwp has undertaken a number of measures to mitigate this impact and the
                contract awarded to ohl na covers the secondtolast phase of the global project
                planned for attenuating the dust emissions the scope of the project includes the
                movement of millions of tons of rock and the installation of an automatic watering
                system along the lake bed

                to date 95 of the dust emissions have already been reduced achieving a positive
                impact on the quality of life of the communities in the area

                from the ecological perspective owens lake has been an important nesting area for
                many birds and one of the benefits of the ponds and areas of vegetation generated is
                that birds are returning to the lake to breed the lake is an important stopover for
                hundreds of species of birds and now that there are more insects the birds can return
                the audubon society has designated owens lake as an important area for bird
                conservation as an example a key development has been the return to the area of the
                snowy plover an endangered species

                the project is regenerating the area and attracts not only birds during their annual
                migration but also tourists looking for ecotourism destinations

roads buildings conveyor belts among others in the case of the elements
whose design has to be outsourced for example the pyroprocessing these
are also integrated into the system this contributes to considerably improving
and streamlining coordination in the entire team involved in the preparation of
the project

one of the major successes already achieved is that the great majority of the
drawings are extracted from the 3d models with the result that there is a full
guarantee that what is modeled will appear in the same way on the drawings
thereby eliminating errors in coordinates elevations heights and labels

moreover and with the ongoing objective of improving and optimizing
processes the intention in this project is to take several additional steps towards
the implementation of a complete bim model the first step in that direction
consists of the incorporation into the model of the fourth dimension 4d that
is time the 5d model cost control has also been initiated with the extraction
of part of the measurements from the models and plans are for advancing as
far as 7d



and procedures and has integrated            technological platform that ensures

                 outcomes 2016

                 the consumption of materials and the generation of waste in 2016 were reduced
                 by 16 and 34 respectively in comparison to 2015 associated with the decline
                 in production

                 the home markets are responsible for 66 of consumption mainly chile and
                 spain australia algeria vietnam and saudi arabia account for the remaining
                 34

                 the principal types of materials consumed are soil rock and aggregate 70 as
                 well as concrete and cement 18

                 the construction business consumes 99 of the ohl groups materials

                 the percentage of materials originating from recycling and reuse totals 382 and
                 includes soil aggregate and steel

                 the principal waste generated is made up by soil and aggregate 99 of the total
                 figure derived from construction operations the distribution by country is
                 similar to that of the consumption of soil and rock spain as the primary generator
                 followed by chile algeria and peru

                 in the activities of concessions and developments the waste generated consists
                 mostly of urban and organic waste due to the operations for infrastructure
                 maintenance and to the services provided

                 in terms of management the construction and demolition waste cdw presents
                 a high percentage of recovery 30 in comparison to deposit there is little scope
                 for improving this percentage because of the difficulty in locating costefficient
                 alternative uses in the vicinity of the works the rest of the nonhazardous waste is
                 managed for the most part by recycling and reuse thanks to the development of a
                 market for byproducts                                                                 

                                                                                          capital management       139


         water consumption in 2016 increased 13 with respect to 2015 due to the start
         of plant maintenance contracts in the industrial division and the construction
         projects in australia this increase in consumption has taken place in reused or
         recycled water thereby reducing the impact on the extraction of the resource in
         the immediate environment with the drawingup of the water scarcity footprint
         protocol the discharges are calculated with the urban waste water as well as with
         the water from the water table which is the reason why a yearonyear comparison
         is not feasible

                 the consumption of direct and indirect energy has been reduced with respect to
                 2015 by 112 and 29 respectively associated with the decline in activity

                 the trend of the group in terms of the sources of energy consumed is toward the
                 reduction of the use of fossil fuels in favor of electricity moreover in 2016 the
                 use of electricity with a 100 renewable energy guarantee of origin totaled close
                 to 15000 gj in line with the principles of sustainable procurement

                 in addition the group generated and consumed slightly more than 7000 gj of
                 energy from the sun in its concessions during 2016 the decline in activity and in
                 consumption has resulted in a reduction in direct ghg emissions of 13 almost
                 25000 tco2e in comparison to 2015 while reducing the indirect emissions from
                 the consumption of electricity by 3 scope 3 increased 206 with respect
                 to 2015 due to the start of operations of several concessions in colombia and
                 mexico

                 the construction business generated more than 75 of the scope 12 emissions
                 stemming from its energy demand while 78 of scope 3 was associated with the
                 activities of the concessions division owing to the use of the infrastructures under
                 concession

                 in 2016 3075 tco2e were offset in the us spain mexico chile colombia and
                 peru the tons offset by the group since 2011 total more than 10000 t

                 the emissions of other pollutants to the air nox sox cov and pm have
                 been reduced by 107 with respect to 2015 consistent with the lower fuel
                 consumption

                 in 2016 ohl has worked in adjacent areas or has been located in 39 protected
                 areas or nonprotected areas with high biodiversity value the main impacts are on
                 water resources the coastal environment the ecosystems and the preexisting plant
                 and animal life the impacts are controlled by means of measurement plans and
                 through offsetting actions included in the environmental impact assessment

                 in the context of biodiversity and as a result of the occupation of the land by its
                 operations the group has developed soil protection measures on a surface of
                 1062 ha and has performed the environmental restoration of 4111 ha
