                                basic environmental policy


  basic environmental policy of dynic
       dynic corporation is aware the efforts toward environmental preservation are an important
   business challenge and believes it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to observe domestic and
   overseas laws and regulations related to the environment and provide products with less environ
   mental burden to the markets to implement the concept in a specific manner we will thoroughly
   promote the following items in each of the stages including development material procurement
   manufacturing sales distribution and disposal

   1 we will reduce the environmental burden in all stages of our business activities throughout the life
       cycle of the products
   2 we will proactively make efforts to save energy and reduce waste thereby preventing environ
       mental contamination
   3 we will prevent risk caused by harmful chemical substances that damage the environment
   4 we will disclose information regarding our business activities related to the environment and
       proactively promote environment preservation activities while acting in concert with local com
       munities and
   5 we will implement education related to environmental preservation thereby improving awareness
       of the environment
                                                                               yoshio oishi president
                                                                               dynic corporation


efforts for reducing environmental burden
     we are introducing the manufacturing method that features less of an energy burden and implement
ing product design where resource saving and longer service life are taken into consideration in addition
we consider materials that feature less of an environmental burden and materials that are easy to recycle
from the design phase of the product in the manufacturing phase we make efforts to save energy and
reduce waste in the manufacturing scene every day thereby contributing to the reduction in the environ
mental burden in the marketing phase we propose environmentally friendly products that reduce the
environmental burden at the customer by using the products thereby making efforts to contribute to the
environmental preservation of the earth

efforts for countermeasures against global warming and biodiversity conservation
     we are promoting countermeasures against global warming through our efforts for energysaving
activities throughout dynic thereby reducing emissions of carbon dioxide in addition regarding the biodi
versity conservation we are making efforts toward coexistence with the global environment through our
activities toward risks including countermeasures against global warming

                                     activity status 2014

regional contribution activities
     we named two asteroids which our astronomical observatory dynic astropark tenkyukan in the
shiga factory discovered tomiokamachi and heiankyo and they were registered based on our
concept contributing to global environmental protection by knowing other planets we have been using
the names of regional areas for asteroid names thereby achieving regional contribution this time we
determined to make a contribution to kyoto prefecture which is the birthplace of the company and we
reported the naming of heiankyo to the kyoto prefectural government




heatshielding construction
     we applied special heatshielding sheets behind the ceiling of the office building and the engineering
building of the shiga factory the indoor heat will be retained and the outdoor heat will not be taken into
rooms through the use of this shielding and the operational load of air conditioning can eventually be
reduced which contributes to a significant reduction in energy consumption and co2 emissions

                                       activity status 2014

exhaust heat recovery equipment
     the machines newly installed in the saitama factory are
equipped with exhaust heat recovery equipment thereby
enhancing further energy savings and a reduction in co2 emis
sions a duct that is capable of recirculating and reusing the
exhaust heat is installed at the upper part of the dryer to achieve
a significant reduction in fuel use




transformer with higher efficiency
     the 1200 kva transformer of the moka factory was replaced with one with higher efficiency since
the transformer had been used under a low load factor the capacity was lowered to the adequate
capacity of 750 kva which is best suited for the load the introduction of higherefficiency transformers
and the revision of the capacity contributed to the achievement of a significant reduction in co2 emis
sions and lower operation noise




                                         replacement with higherefficiency type




led lighting
      we are sequentially replacing the fluorescent ceiling lights
of the moka factory with led lighting reducing the power
consumption by 55 compared to fluorescent lamps in addi
tion since led lighting has the effect of not attracting insects it
also contributes to quality improvement

 measures for global warmingenergy saving
       in our production activities we create products by consuming energy as a result we emit co2 a global warming gas with
the goal of reduction in co2 emissions we are making efforts to reduce the consumed energy in the production processes we are
developing our activities under the goal of reducing the gas by 1 every year as compared with 2009 as investments in energy
saving equipment we have been implementing the replacement of ceiling lights mercury lamps of factories with led lamps
change of transformers to the higherefficiency type change of air conditioners to the higherefficiency type change of compressors
to the centralized type and the change of lights in office buildings to led lamps
       regarding the business performance in fiscal 2014 we could not achieve the goal since the specific energy consumption
deteriorated on the other hand co2 emissions were reduced due to the reduced production and we could suppress the emissions
below the target value in fiscal 2015 we will implement energy efficiency improvement measures that comply with the reduced
production and work harder toward the achievement of our goal

resource saving waste reduction
effective utilization of water resources
     we at dynic are also working on the effective utilization of water resources throughout the company in our
production processes we have been making efforts to reduce the total water resource input and the total drain
age volume by promoting the recycling of used cleaning water cooking water etc in fiscal 2014 we achieved a
reduction of the total water reresource input by about 17 and the total drainage volume by about 16
compared to fiscal 2006

       reduction in waste
            we are working on the reduction of waste to protect the global environment for our activities we have been
       promoting reuse and recycling not only for the purpose of reducing the total quantity of waste but also from the
       viewpoint of the effective utilization of resources regarding the total quantity of materials used we could achieve
       a reduction of 188 from 37129 tons in 2010 to 30166 tons in 2014 although the total quantity of waste was
       slightly on the uptrend in 2014 and thereafter the final disposal quantity of waste has been reduced year by year
       as a result of promoting reuse and recycling thus resulting in a reduction of 56 compared to 2006

on a reduction thereof
     the total drainage volume in fiscal 2014 remained almost the same as the fiscal 2013 performance but the
total moving amount was reduced by 48 in fiscal 2015 we introduced combustiontype voc processing
equipment as a result a further reduction in the total drainage volume can be expected
