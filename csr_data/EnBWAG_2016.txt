enbw employees
are shaping the
energiewende 
almost 20000 people work at enbw they are specialists
in many different fields and know for example how to
operate power plants and grids build solar power plants or
 plan wind farms and they develop new products for our
 customers and ensure there is a reliable supply of energy

it is the knowledge they have accumulated over decades
and their approach to the energiewende that are helping
the company to push forward the transformation of enbw
we are shaping the energiewende  and now we are also
talking about it this will be the theme behind our image
campaign starting in april

enbw has already been implementing its 2020 strategy for
three years this has included erecting offshore wind farms
and designing new products now its time to talk about it and
to show off those who have made it happen  our employees




enbw is charting a new course

be a challenge for us the restructuring of enbw is not

us to hide away this is why we are starting a com

     port in karlsruhe naturally offer significantly greater      of the auditors customers can thus rely on the fact for
     reserves it sets the standard for efficiency and thus the    example that green electricity generated by enbw is not
     environmentally friendly generation of electricity and        only completely sourced from renewable energies but

modern streetlights dont only provide light we are
making them the foundations for a networked city
digitalisation stopped being a vision of the future long
ago and has already become a reality an important
factor for local authorities is thus providing a good

only responded to this requirement but is actively
pushing forward developments in this area one ex

     the focus is on us 
     employees stand in front of the camera for the campaign
     in hidden laboratories huge power plants or under the
     cold night sky although it is sometimes stressful they
     have fun doing it




     models with a passion  for their company
     the casting auditions gave the organisers a good over
     view of the employees that wanted to participate in the
     campaign they then looked for candidates for the next
     stage  the photo shoots and they selected locations
     for the shoots together with those employees selected
     to appear in the campaign one of those employees is
     alois kessler

     the enbw engineer is carrying out research in a project
     with the german aerospace center dlr in stuttgart into
     micro gas turbines that very efficiently generate elec
     tricity when i read the request for volunteers i imme
     diately wanted to get involved said the 50yearold

     things got serious on a tuesday in february spotlights
     and cameras were set up in the dlr laboratory the
     makeup artist removed small threads from his pull
     over and the photo shoot began he was required to
     change his clothes time and again during the shoot
     kessler is impressed the photographer took a total
     of 200 shots of me he is excited to find out whether
     they will also show photos of him where he lives

     there is lots of work involved in preparing for the shoots
     and dozens of appointments need to be organised there
     are strict safety regulations in force at many locations
      such as at nuclear hydropower and coal power plants
     it was necessary to change the appointments for the
     photo shoots a number of times in order to find more
     time for them says producer andreas hofmann

    letter to shareholders




    dr frank mastiaux
    chairman of the board of management




    the developments over the past year have given the energiewende an even greater impetus the expansion of
    renewable energies in germany is continuing with undiminished vigour global investment also reached record
    levels of over 300 billion euros at the same time pressure on conventional generation is increasing firstly due
    to the co2 targets agreed at the climate change conference that are endorsed by enbw and secondly due to the
    reaction of the capital market  with an increasing number of investors withdrawing from fossil fuels the low
    wholesale prices on the german electricity exchanges which have fallen even more significantly recently have
    made it almost impossible to operate power plants economically current discussions demonstrate that the
    energy policy conditions for energy companies will not improve

    these facts emphasise that we will only be able to position our company to face up to the energiewende with its
    great challenges but also great opportunities under our own steam neither the market nor the political
    environment will help us do it

    it was with this attitude that we developed our 2020 strategy in the middle of 2013 which we have rigorously
    implemented since then and can honestly say today we believe that all of the developments on the market and
    amongst the competition have so far proved that this is the right strategy from the very beginning we expected

enbw integrated report 2015                                                                      for our stakeholders  letter to shareholders   7




                   a radical fall in earnings from conventional generation of 80 per cent by 2020 we aim to fully compensate for
                   this decline in earnings through the expansion of renewable energies the grid business and our sales business
                   by 2020 and we want to achieve this as one company and one team which will successfully achieve this
                   transformation together



                   important steps achieved in the implementation of the strategy
                   in the 2015 financial year we came a great deal closer to achieving the goals of our enbw 2020 strategy although
                   we were not able to acquire the wind energy company prokon we have successfully pushed forward the
                   expansion of renewable energies under our own steam our second offshore wind farm enbw baltic 2 was fully
                   connected to the grid in september the onshore wind farm harthäuser wald has also been placed into
                   operation and is the largest wind farm in badenwürttemberg to date

                   a very important strategic step in the restructuring of the company and the largest transaction in the history of
                   enbw is the exchange of our minority shareholding in ewe for a majority shareholding in the gas company
                   vngverbundnetz gas aktiengesellschaft vng this means we will double our gas business and become the
                   third largest gas supplier on the german market at the same time we will be strengthened our regulated grid
                   business because vng generates more than 50 per cent of its earnings from gas transport and gas distribution

                   we were able to significantly improve our operating result above all in the area of renewable energies as a
                   result we were able to maintain the operating result of the enbw group at an almost stable level at 21 billion
                   euros despite an extremely difficult economic environment we owe this stability to the success of our growth
                   initiatives and our improvements in efficiency the positive developments in our nonfinancial goals that are
                   supporting us during our transformation have also been pleasing the satisfaction of our customers improved
                   markedly in 2015 and we were also able to record a significant improvement in our employee commitment

                   in the near and distant future we do not anticipate any improvement in conditions despite historically low
                   electricity prices therefore we also had to recognise high impairment losses on our power plants in 2015 and
                   were forced to increase provisions for onerous contracts for electricity procurement agreements these items
                   had a negative impact of 950 million euros on our result in contrast to the previous year we were nevertheless
                   able to report a group net profit attributable to the shareholders of enbw ag of 125 million euros



                   were making it happen
                   we will push forward with the restructuring of our company with even greater commitment in 2016 and further
                   develop our projects in the areas of onshore and offshore wind power alongside the expansion of renewable
                   energies we will define measures to significantly improve our competitiveness in our sales business in the grids
                   sector the focus will be on extensive investment in the distribution grids for the expansion and upgrading of
                   our existing grids the acquisition of vng means that the further development of our gas business will become
                   another key area of focus in view of the renewed deterioration of the framework conditions we will of course
                   resolutely pursue our measures for improving efficiency due to the wholesale prices for electricity which are
                   not only consistently low but also continuing to fall our operating result in 2016 will once again be below that
                   achieved in the previous year

                   the board of management management personnel and employees are one enbw team that will continue the
                   restructuring of the company in 2016 with undiminished energy and by taking courageous steps based on a
                   stable economic and political environment we have resolved to set the wheels in motion to improve our
                   earnings performance and thus achieve our goals for 2020 we will fulfil our promise

                   yours sincerely
