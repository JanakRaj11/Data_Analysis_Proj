and to avoid recurrence focus on onboarding new work which is aligned to our
strategic plans contract type and client profile going forward we will support
this by providing commercial acumen training to reinforce our commercially

   act fairly




   what i enjoy most about my role is working with our people ontheground
   in our businesses during this year i visited all our businesses and i was
   impressed by how strongly our leaders and our people believe in living our
   values and acting with integrity and fairness in their work


   our people recognise the importance of being truthful and honest behaving
   consistently and respecting each other their business partners and the
   communities they work in they take pride in laios reputation for integrity
   and excellence and understand that we are all responsible for protecting that
   reputation


   like all companies we have rules and processes to follow but sometimes the
   rules may not be clear this is when we look to our values to guide us       in
   making a decision about how to act we can easily ask am i behaving fairly
   am i acting with integrity our code of business conduct also contains a
   decisionmaking checklist which gives our people further support in making
   the right decisions


   ultimately acting with integrity and fairness is vital to our business by living
   this value we build trust with each other and with all our stakeholders this
   makes for stronger teamwork and enhances our performance it also helps
   us hold each other accountable for our behaviour and manage the risk of
   corruption fraud and other misconduct


   we are a large complex business with almost 18000 employees in more
   than 10 countries operating across multiple languages and cultures so of
   course there are ethical challenges in the work we do but we are continuously
   working to strengthen our culture and embed supporting governance
   launching our enhanced code of business conduct which forms part of
   the leighton groups ethics and compliance framework was an important
   milestone for laio this year


   we also released a plain language guide to our code designed to support our         samantha dunn
   people to live our code and to illustrate how we work with each other and with       group manager ethics
   others in 2012 laio also created the role of group manager ethics  my role
    to reflect the importance of ethical business practices at laio and drive the
   implementation of the enhanced laio code we are now working on training
   and governance initiatives to support the embedding of our code

                                                                             act with integrity  fairness 37

   we will
   reduce our carbon footprint
   use resources efficiently
   minimise our impact on the environment

   mining and construction operations here in indonesia consume
   significant resources and energy while altering the physical
   landscape there are many contractors operational in indonesia
   both excavating and transporting coal ore and waste material
   and engaged in construction and civil engineering so what sets
   leighton asia india and offshore apart


   we differentiate ourselves via rigorous implementation of
   our environmental management systems by exercising
   environmental consideration and taking appropriate steps to
   ensure we manage the environmental impacts associated with
   mining and construction we gain a competitive advantage


   to live by our core value protect the environment in 2012
   we focused on training our people we rolled out three new
   environmental training standard packages to the projects these
   included waste management hydrocarbon management and
   erosion  sedimentation control these packages along with
   others being readied for rollout have been designed to increase
   understanding and awareness of environmental protection among
   our employees


   additionally our indonesia projects participated and initiated
   numerous environmental activities throughout 2012 these range
   from beach cleanups and earth hour activities at our balikpapan
   support facility and a mine site cleanup day at the martabe
   gold mine to environmental stewardship programs in waste
   management  biodiversity protection some of our environmental
   initiatives have led to employee recognition employees on our
   donggi senoro lng project were recognised by our client as
   environmental heroes for demonstrating outstanding leadership
   in environmental awareness


   our project managements commitment to protecting the
   environment is evidenced by these ongoing environmentally
   focused activities and related performance recognition we are
                                                                       wisnu sugesti

   in indonesia we trialed four stateofthe art caterpillar simulators at the martabe gold and silver mine on
   the western side of sumatra island fitted into a purposedesigned and built portable container that was
   powered by a single diesel generator the sophisticated simulators were used to equip inexperienced
   members of the local community with the basic skills and knowledge to operate heavy equipment
   without the need for actual machines


   by eliminating the need to operate four pieces of heavy equipment we estimated that our carbon
   dioxide emissions are reduced by more than 84 or 1076 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over a
   oneyear period with fuel savings of over us 50000


   we are now looking to establish training simulator centres at our major mining projects in indonesia
   this will allow us to benefit local communities with the basic skills training required to operate heavy
   equipment in a safe and environmentally responsible manner


   use resources efficiently

   the construction industry generates considerable waste streams in asias densely populated urban
   areas hong kong one of our key construction markets faces an acute shortage of landfill capacity yet
   the total volume of construction waste sent to landfill and public fill increases every year in 2011 alone
   construction and demolition activities generated 175 million and 12 million tonnes of waste destined for
   landfill and public fill respectively as a leading player in hong kongs construction market we recognise
   the role we can play in reducing overall waste volumes


   through a series of initiatives to raise awareness and facilitate actions around reducing recycling and
   reusing both at our site and office level we are striving to improve our level of resource efficiency
   during 2012 we also began gathering waste baseline data with a view to establishing a waste
   management strategy in 201314


   hong kong in hong kong we implemented a number of green initiatives at our office and various
   projects at our project to construct the centralwan chai bypass  central interchange and island
   eastern corridor link we have been sorting and recycling rubbish reusing wastewater saving energy
   with timer plugs that turn off office equipment from 8pm to 6am using a solarpowered mosquito killer

              collect rainwater to water plants at the sai ying pun site and planted epipremnum a perennial vine that
              helps filter the air by absorbing dust and toxic volatile organic compounds at the aberdeen site in

              to reduce our carbon footprint we use our own containers to pack takeaway food and have ceased
              using disposable utensils for office functions and events we use plants to improve the indoor air quality
              we carpool or take public transportation for meetings outside the office when not in use the office
              lights air conditioners computer monitors printers scanners and other equipment are switched off we
              also use recycled paper and print on both sides where possible purchase some office furniture second

              at our mumbai office held informative sessions about waste management and recycling for our team
              working on the development of the ramanujan it park in chennai employees at our delhi office also
              signed individual pledges to make small environmentally friendly changes to their daily habits and

   minimise our impact on the
   environment

   indonesia during our site preparation work for
   the donggisenoro lng plant in central sulawesi
   we implemented two environmental programmes
   for waste management as well as the reporting
   and protection of the native flora and fauna
   these programs were adopted by the client as
   the standard for the other subcontractors on the
   project


   we currently operate a number of coal and gold
   mines in indonesia in 2012 we explored the use of
   bioremediation technologies as a way to remove
   pollutants and treat affected areas such as soil
   contaminated by oil and diesel spills from heavy
   equipment bioremediation uses microorganisms

   the region with little or no access to eye clinics many members of these
   communities needlessly suffered loss of quality of life and potential earnings
   due to relatively minor eyesight problems

   eye camp in which nearly 600 patients have had their cataracts successfully
   removed and their vision restored additionally no fewer than 2600 patients
   with minor eye problems have been treated our efforts to restore the vision
   of local community members have been publicly acknowledged by the chief
   minister of jammu kashmir state omar abdullah
