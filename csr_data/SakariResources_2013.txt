sustainability report 2012

                  to enrich and improve lives
     through the reliable and responsible delivery of energy
                            products
sustainability in the group centres on a desire to see that sakaris work practices have the ability
to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their needs sustainability is a fundamental part of sakaris corporate culture by which we strive
to ensure our successes are shared in a balanced way to give long term benefits to all stakeholders
including the environment and local communities

last years annual report available for reference or download through our website
httpwwwsakariresourcescom contained sakaris first formal consolidated sustainability report
in that report we explained our key areas of focus for sustainable practices set out our achievements
during 2011 and commitments for 2012 later in this report we will examine our 2012 achievements
and comment on how far we succeeded in attaining our goals

we stated that one goal for 2012 was to formalise the standards to which sakari must aspire

a key development in 2012 was a decision to implement a sustainability programme using iso26000
as the platform for our work iso26000 has helped us to formalise and understand our standards
and aspirations in sustainable work practices the framework provides stakeholders with increased
awareness and comfort on sakaris strong commitment in this area a process of assessing existing
business performance against robust external guidelines now drives the sustainability process and
positions the activity among sakaris continuous improvement initiatives

we have not yet decided to adopt the global reporting initiative gri as our reporting platform in
part because sustainable practices have been a cornerstone of sakaris business ethic since we first
began mining at sebuku in 1998 but also because gri does require a significant new investment at
a time when margins have been under pressure we felt that iso26000 provides a very appropriate
measure for assessment that enables us to reach a higher standard of reporting without increasing
costs a decision that is itself is a sustainable practice

using iso 26000 we made an analysis of the group and its sustainable practices and found that we
are well compliant in all areas which our stakeholders are entitled to expect however we did conclude
that whilst the group does produce large amounts of data to monitor all parts of its business our
monitoring analysis and reporting of that data can be improved we have therefore begun developing
a centralized process for gathering analysing and reporting on the very extensive data that we already
have in our operations

sustainable planning foundations

with the adoption of iso26000 we have created a formal sustainability committee chaired by
the group ceo with members comprising various division heads from our leadership team the
committee has confirmed our basic premise that sakaris programmes and reviews should be based
on how we make money as well as how we spend it and programmes and deliverables should
target longterm permanent improvements for stakeholders with local communities set as key
stakeholders to benefit from our health and wellbeing programmes the values that sakari applies
in its sustainability programmes are based on the groups stated values




                                                  2

under iso26000 we have segmented our sustainability reporting initiatives into 7 categories which
are reported on below

community
our commitment to the development of the stakeholder communities surrounding our mines
transcends compliance with relevant laws and regulations

sakari is well known for being a leader in community work particularly at sebuku where our
healthcare and education programmes explained in 2011s sustainability report have met with
many successes jembayan is a much bigger mine and we have found it more difficult to define exactly
how best to define the local communities who are stakeholders of the mine it was this difficulty that
has led to sakari forming a cglm community government and land management department
with employees devoted to handling community relations and empowerment programmes

this division is tasked with ensuring that sakaris community development activities are formed
through an improved planning process and efficiently implemented against targets reporting on
progress and analysing the level of success of any programme is now an important part of the
divisions work that is incorporated into the iso26000 process

one of the decisions of the division has been to place community development programmes into
two categories the first category relates to smallscale programmes these tend to be programmes
that are considered as social responsiveness and provide more immediate assistance to overcome
special problems and needs these programmes are more likely to be proposed through the sites
and are also managed by the sites cglm division will monitor these various programmes the
second category is larger scale programmes whose effects are more likely to be focussed on the
longer term for success this kind of programme is usually approved at a senior level within the
group and managed or monitored by cglm division

social mapping

recognising the importance of better defining jembayans stakeholders we undertook a social
mapping survey for the jembayan mine communities in 2012 the survey was undertaken in
conjunction with universitas mulawarman a local university and focussed on two key targets firstly
mapping actual living conditions and secondly identifying important needs of the communities for
longterm benefits

a similar survey will be conducted on sebuku in 2013 involving universitas lambung mangkurat
both surveys will be used as the foundation for planning community development initiatives further
the data we have collected will enable us to evaluate the success of our programmes and the impact
of our operations positives and negatives on the community

2012 programmes

programmes that we initiated at jembayan during 2012 included the establishment of 3 sekolah
lapangan pertanian agricultural field schools to support farmer groups following up on our
commitment to extend the integrated farming system that we had successfully introduced at sebuku
we also conducted starter programmes for livestock husbandry mainly lambs and goats using the
integrated farming system




                                                  3

at sebuku we trained volunteers from 5 villages on the island in the integrated farming system with these
individuals we went on to create a demonstration farm that will give a practical introduction and education
to island farmers about the benefits and methods of integrated farming by the end of 2012 the farm had
been duplicated in 3 villages we have targets for more demonstration farms in more villages with a goal
that each village will have its own farm to market and sell a specific product outside sebuku the concept
being one village one product

in prior years we have done much to reduce child mortality rates at sebuku following up on these
initiatives in the wider community for midwives in kotabaru samarinda and balikpapan we sponsored
a programme with kk hospital singapore that focussed on reducing maternal mortality rate the
programme aimed to support the government of indonesias target in the millenium development
goals this collaboration with kk hospital will be implemented regularly

our employees carried out many spontaneous activities in assisting with natural disaster victims
such as blood donations and support for flood victims in balikpapan

we said in 2011 that we planned to sponsor an eye cataract removal clinic we had set up an arrangement
for a venture led by a renowned charity that had organised similar very successful clinics in sumatera
treating over 1000 people over 35 days in each clinic organising such an event requires significant
planning and help from various sections of government unfortunately due to changes at senior
government levels the charity was unable to confirm involvement from all the key departments and we
could not bring the plan to fruition


 2012 commitments                                           outcomes

 sakari will continue its commitments in community          sakari has continued its community
 development in 2012 while maintaining the existing        programmes as it intended these are
 programmes sakari has planned some new                    longterm plans designed to enrich and
 programs in 2012 like the eye camp and motherchild        improve lives
 health programmes the integrated farming system
 will also be duplicated in villages and upscaled if        the eye cataract camp was postponed for
 necessary the key personnel will be trained further       reasons explained above
 to ensure the mastery of this farming system              the integrated farming programme has
                                                            also expanded and is mentioned above

 an initiative to synchronize the understanding of          this work was done in 2012 with exceptional
 sustainable practices between the management              results land management and land
 middle management and site frontliners has been           compensation are one of the most sensitive
 designed in 2012 sakari will hold a workshop for          areas for the group at the present time and
 cglm personnel to minimize the gap within the              the issue is receiving much attention from
 group regarding cglm issues                               management

                                                     4

 2012 commitments                                               outcomes

 for 2012 we expressed our intention to make a formal           we have begun a formal process
 evaluation and assessment of how our customers and             of informing each of our customers
 their practices should be included into the context of         about      sakaris   sustainability
 sustainability                                                programmes

we have found increasing interest from our customers in sakaris work in this area and are now
well prepared to answer customers queries and to begin to encourage them to be more transparent
about their own programmes

we have considered our products carefully and concluded that nothing we sell is inherently dangerous
to customers in the form in which it is sold it is organically and chemically stable and can be handled
stored and stockpiled safely with low risk to the environment and people provided normal industry
safety standards are followed

sakari discloses specifications for its products in a clear and transparent manner independent
analysis of the products prior to sale ensures that customers are able to be assured about quality
and that a fair price is achieved for each sale any discrepancies between quoted and actual
specifications are openly resolved with customers

many of sakaris customers request multiyear contracts so that they can enjoy assured supplies and
a longterm relationship with sakari these longterm relationships evidence the value we place on
consumer service support and responsibility when making sales

environment
environmental care and protection present important challenges to sakari if we fail in our obligations
in any one of a multitude of expectations and regulations we would place our ability to continue
mining at risk and if that happened so the livelihoods of many people communities and biodiverse
systems would be similarly at risk for that reason sakari remained as vigilant as ever in 2012
towards the environment

in addition to regular federal state and local audits we continued our own audit programme using
independent environmental auditors environmental resource management all the audits confirmed the
good state of our environmental work and only minor issues were proposed for review or improvement
actions were immediately instigated in accordance with the recommendations of each audit

we continued our proactive work of reviewing our potential effect on the environment including
biodiversity and greenhouse gases in this area we worked with mulawarman university of
samarinda for a study on biodiversity at jembayan with mulawarman university and the indonesian
institute of science jakarta for a study of baseline counting of greenhouse gas emissions

2012 awards and certifications

jembayan successfully attained iso 140012004 certification by lloyds register quality iso
140012004 is the internationally recognized standard for environmental management systems

both mines received the blue rank environmental assessment award proper from the ministry
for the environment which is the clearest signal that our operations comply with all environmental
regulations both mines also received pratama reclamation award 3rd place from the ministry of
mines and energy resources

                                                   5

hydroseeding

we found that reclamation in some parts of sebuku at the old tanah putih pit was slow mainly due
to the limited top soil in the area in order to improve the pace of rehabilitation we successfully tried
and began hydroseeding during 2012 as our confidence in the practice of the rehabilitation method
increased we progressively rehabilitated about 100ha of the tanah putih pit we also began to
introduce the same methods into rehabilitation work at jembayan where we covered a total of about
87 hectares by hydroseeding


 2012 commitments                                               outcomes

 the need for environmental care respect and protection        the      group    encountered      no
 is something about which sakari has always been acutely        significant or unusual environmental
 aware we expressed no formal commitments for 2012            issues in 2012 and won awards from
 preferring to have our work progress organically as it has    government for its work in this area
 done over the years under our mantra of continuous
 improvement

2013 commitments

sakari intends to

      	conduct a study of its carbon footprint with a target of setting goals for reduction or control
      	increase the quality of analysis of the large amount of data that is produced by the mine
        sites to monitor our effect on the environment and compliance with standards the goal of
        this work is to consider where we might improve our practices in order to reduce the effect
        that our mines have on the environment

fair operating practices

 2012 commitments                                               outcomes

 fop was not singled out for discussion with no specific        na
 targets set

with the adoption of iso26000 fop is now a core area that sakari will monitor centrally and report
publicly upon fop covers 5 main areas anticorruption responsible political involvement fair
competition promoting social responsibility and respect for property rights

as with other matters related to sustainability sakari has been committed to fop since its incorporation
in 1995 and we have not encountered any significant failings in our work and practice in terms of
fulfilling fop expectations our review under iso26000 did conclude that we need to give our staff
a greater understanding of fop which will be attained through more training in our relevant policies

2013 commitments

sakari intends to

      	conduct greater socialisation of its policies relating to fop in particular anticorruption
        policies
      	begin a process of auditing its supply chain on their commitment to fop
      	create a central group contacts register which will allow us to monitor contact with
        government officials and government bodies so that the extent of contact and regularity is
        monitored

                                                   6

human rights

 2012 commitments                                          outcomes
 human rights was not an area that we had                  na
 singled out for discussion last year as such
 there were no specific targets

with the adoption of iso26000 we have identified areas where our practice can be formalized
and should be publicly reported upon there is no doubt that sakari respects human rights and in
practice it adheres to the united nations universal declaration of human rights our charter which
is set out in this sustainability report indirectly reflects our commitment to observing human rights
however we recognize that we have not incorporated fundamental human rights statements into
our formal policies this is something that we are addressing although formal adoption will not mean
sakari will need to change any of its current practices

we have noted that we have relatively low levels of female employees in the mining operations
despite having been an equal opportunity employer however this low level is not unexpected in
indonesia and the mining industry but is an area we intend to consider closely for improvements

2013 commitments

sakari intends to

        	formally incorporate human rights statements into its policies to avoid any doubt that we
          adhere to these practices
        	formally adopt a regular process to evaluate human rights risks
          audit all our main suppliers for their approach to human rights
        	seek ways to increase the level of female employment in the mining operations
          consider opportunities to employ disabled staff

labour
labour matters were addressed last year under the heading people the change of designation
reflects the commitment to iso 26000 as our standard for sustainable practice reporting

safety

sakaris commitment to safety is at the absolute centre of our work ethic the key statistic that we use
for measuring safety at our mines is ltifr lost time injury frequency rate the 5year ltifr history
of each of our mines is set out in the graphs below

organisational governance

 2012 commitments                                     outcomes
 this was not an area that we had singled out         na
 for discussion last year as such there were
 no specific targets

we have now created a sustainability committee see above that reports to the boards risk
management committee a key aspect for ensuring that systems are in place for managing and
implementing decisions

our review of how sakari is faring in terms of organisational governance in 2012 found that we
do engage all stakeholders regularly both formally and informally our internal structures are also
robust
