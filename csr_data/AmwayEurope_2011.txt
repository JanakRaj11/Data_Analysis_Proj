capital direct selling is particularly suited to women with
family commitments and to those who want to start a

managing our environmental impacts

reducing our environmental impact means adapting the way we operate in 2010
we have started to develop a more comprehensive environmental management
system and as a consequence we will launch our new environmental practices
manual across our operations in europe we have started a programme of increasing
the sustainability of our local and international events another example of positive
sustainability actions is our decision to move the manufacturing of specific home
care products from the united states to europe reducing transportation carbon
emissions by up to 79 per cent


improving environmental management                            the product formulations and packaging will continue
                                                              to meet our high quality and performance standards
we are committed to improving our environmental               going through the same level of commitment on sourcing
management systems year on year our aim to move to           quality and production as usual
a more comprehensive management system under the
global reporting initiative gri in 2011 and beyond will     manufacturing these home care products locally will
further improve our systems                                  not only increase efficiency through reduced lead times
                                                              but also deliver up to 79 per cent reductions in carbon
people play a large role in helping to reduce our             emissions during transportation
environmental impacts including energy waste and water
use in our offices that is why we have been developing
a new environmental practices manual the manual  to
be launched in 2011  is a userfriendly guide to help
managers and staff to conserve energy reduce water and
tackle waste more effectively


transportation and carbon emissions
as a company we want to play our part in tackling climate
change by reducing our carbon footprint as well as
reducing energy use  and carbon emissions  in offices
and buildings we have identified potential for reducing
emissions from international transportation

for example we traditionally produce all our home care
products in the united states in 2010 we will begin local
production of dish drops concentrated dishwashing
liquid loc multi purpose cleaner sa8 delicate and
amway gel oven cleaner in europe these products are
scheduled to be in market from around october 2011
