and precise data the strength of epsons crystal device and semiconductor businesses
allowed us to develop and manufacture highly compact sensors capable of measuring swing very
precisely after a comprehensive survey mizuno found that our technical expertise production system
and more made us the ideal partner for its swing tracer business


epson sensors in the swing tracer measure ordinary velocity and angular velocity of the swing mi
zunos original algorithm uses these measurements to analyze the swing trajectory scientifically allow
ing coaches to coach more proficiently


epson will continue to roll out compact lightweight precision products and related services using
original sensing technology

providing easytofollow video manuals

to provide epson printer users with easytounderstand guides for using their products epson began in november 2013 up
loading pc and smartphoneaccessible video manuals to videosharing website youtube


although epson strives to design printers that are easy to use even for firsttim
ers users sometimes have to refer to paper manuals to learn how to navigate
their way through operations and use certain functions epson has found how
ever that little things that cannot be completely explained in a paper manual can
sometimes concern customers firsttime printer users are not the only ones
susceptible even experienced users who are used to operating earlier epson
printers or printers from other companies can get stuck even after reading the
manual because of difficulty in intuiting or imaging new operating procedures
the first aim of a video manual is to provide users with a vicarious experience
users who first watch operations being performed in a video are likely to have an    the screen for the epson video manual channel
easier time understanding paper manuals


sample screenshots of a watchandlearn video manual




we have heard from customers who have actually used epson video manuals some say for example that they want verbal
explanations instead of subtitles or that they want us to show operations more slowly others have said that the video manuals
are very easy to understand for seniors and they encouraged us to more widely publicize the availability of these manuals


shinji tanaka who is in charge of video manual production says im really pleased to learn
that customers are happy with these videos more and more people are accessing the videos
most calls to support centers are from middleaged and older people so i think we need to find
ways to make it easier for these people to access the video manuals we particularly want to
enrich the content of the videos before the yearend holidays when so many people send cards
to family and friends so that they can find answer questions they may have


as of october 2014 epson has uploaded 42 videos for users in japan and more than a dozen
videos for overseas users                                                                              shinji tanaka

employee monitor program

epson has a monitor program in which employees and their family members can
participate persons who register as monitors evaluate products not as employees
but as customers the objective is to identify ways to improve product usability


in the 2014 fiscal year we had 744 registered monitors who evaluated 22 products
from a variety of perspectives prior to market release the monitors rated the
products which included printers projectors wearable products and more in
terms of operability visibility and other usability and development objectives the   inkjet printer evaluation
information gleaned from the results is used to improve the products and user
manuals

a few examples of companywide activities that took place in 2014 are provided below



                                                                                                                               fy2014 cs  quality month

example 1 meetings to discuss select and address customer needs
we held discussions around the questions do you genuinely understand customer needs what can you do right now for your
customer these discussions afforded an opportunity to examine our quality assurance activities in greater depth each depart
ment considered and discussed what they need to do from a customer perspective to maintain and improve product quality and
customer service
discussions are the start of action not the end the content of discussions is incorporated in action plans
among other things discussions were used to
 talk about past quality issues select issues to address explore countermeasures and implement continuous improvements
 identify small stresses that have not yet been exposed and
 check whether work in administrative departments was tied directly to customer value

example 2 lecture on the prevention of quality problems
an outside lecturer was invited to speak from a quality problem prevention standpoint
about ways to correctly identify customer needs and how to link those to the creation
of customer value
the lecture reminded us that producing products exactly as instructed by planning
and design departments does not create customer value unless the actual needs and
wishes of end users are met it is important for everyone to consider what the cus
tomer expects and to collectively come up with ideas for meeting those expectations

example 3 problemsolving training                                                         lecture on the prevention of quality problems

to sell customerpleasing products and services we have to solve problems in busi
ness processes to do so we have to follow the steps in a logical thinking process that
accurately recognizes and defines problems and digs down to their root causes
instructors provided employees with problemsolving training
employees learned to solve problems by thinking logically in line with a problemsolv
ing process problem identification  identification of problem location  cause analy

analyses to prevent product incidents

electronic components procured for use in epson products and especially those that
are crucial in terms of safety are evaluated and analyzed to judge their quality safety
and reliability


epson uses analytic techniques learned and honed over the years to analyze inmar
ket safety incidents and determine root cause the lessons learned are shared
throughout the epson group to prevent recurrence of similar incidents
                                                                                                  burning test at combustion laboratory

cannot be performed in ordinary laboratories such as tests that use flames or could cause parts or products to ignite emit
smoke or rupture in this lab epson analyzes the causes of incidents and research combustionresistant structures and materi

safety evaluations on substances released by products

products can sometimes release trace amounts of chemical substances during use
epson goes beyond simply evaluating releases of controlled substances specified
under the requirements for environmental labels such as japans eco mark and
germanys blue angel1 and also evaluates the level and safety of substances for
which the japanese health labor and welfare ministry has issued indoor concentra
tion guideline values2 an inhouse laboratory enables us to swiftly feed the findings
from these evaluations back into our products our chemical emission laboratory
acquired isoiec17025 certification in april 2013


epson seeks to deliver safe secure printers projectors and other products by verify
ing that releases from these products meet epsons strict independent standards
that exceed the rigorousness of the health labor and welfare ministrys indoor
concentration guideline values                                                                                                  measurement of substances released by products

1
    blue angel introduced in germany in 1978 is the worlds first environmental label
2
    indoor concentration guideline values are the levels of airborne chemical substances that are considered to be unlikely
    to have harmful personal health effects even if persons take in throughout life the substances at the indicated concentra
    tions

product information security initiatives

once reserved for laser business inkjet and other office printers network connectivity is now routinely provided with home inkjet
printers and other consumer devices which can be accessed via wireless lans smartphones tablets and other wificapable
equipment network connectivity is a great convenience but it also exposes users to security risks such as cyberattacks that
could lead to the destruction of data or the theft of confidential information by persons or organizations who exploit network
device software vulnerabilities3


to ensure the security of epson products epson evaluates the vulnerability of embedded software printer drivers and other
software based on information security requirements included in the epson quality standard eqs requirements for web
services such as epson email print were also included in the eqs in 2012

3
    software vulnerabilities are system flaws or design problems that hackers or other cybercriminals can use to hijack a computer network or other information system or to steal or
    alter confidential information

   commitment to environmental conservation

epson and the environment

environmental vision 2050

environmental vision 2050 announced in june 2008 is a strategic vision that outlines what epson needs to accomplish as a
business enterprise in view of the anticipated deepening of the global environmental crisis




epson has set key conditions below to work towards achieving environmental vision 2050


1 reduction of co2 emissions by 90 across the entire product life cycle
2 inclusion of all products in the resource reuse and recycling loop
3 reduction of direct co2 emissions by 90 and elimination of global warming gas emissions other than co2
4 restoration and preservation of biodiversity as a member of the ecosystem together with local communities

biodiversity

biological diversity ie the existence of diverse forms of life in a given ecosystem
the convention on biological diversity defines this term as the variability among living organisms from all sources including
inter alia terrestrial marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part this includes
diversity within species between species and of ecosystems

resource recycling loop

a system in which the input of new resources is gradually reduced by repeatedly reusing and recycling resources used in earlier
products

backcasting

a planning technique in which a desired outcome or goal is envisioned and planned before the scenario for achieving the out
come or goal is devised



reduction of co2 emissions

the amount of co2 emissions has to be kept within the earths absorption capacity just as people in all parts of the world can
emit co2 each and every one of us must also strive to reduce emissions taking into account the projected population ratio of
2050 epson has set targets of reducing our co2 emissions by 90

business actions to minimize environmental impacts

tackling environmental issues as a pioneer leads to the creation of new competitive strengths


for example applying micro piezo technology1 in an expanded range of commercial and industrial fields and replacing conven
tional analog printing processes with epsons digital printing processes can be expected to sharply reduce environmental im
pacts epson aims to achieve in 2050 a 90 reduction in co2 emissions versus the environmental impacts of current operations
and those of business markets that we are looking to enter we aim to achieve this by reducing the environmental impacts of our
products themselves as well as by reducing their impacts during use

life cycle thinking

epson defines an ecoconsiderate product as one for which environmental impacts are considered from product conception to
mission completion that is at every phase of the life cycle from design and manufacturing to transport usage and recycling
through the creation of ecoconsiderate products we are cooperating with customers and business partners to expand our
environmental impact mitigation efforts beyond epsons doors

design for environment

the environmental impacts of a product across its life cycle from cradle to grave are largely determined at
the planning and designengineering stages


epson takes a lifecycle thinking approach in efforts to minimize customers environmental impacts by
providing products that change the way they work and live and 2 provide products that offer the environ                                                       think
mental performance they should have as a basic feature we set concrete targets for environmental speci
fications that should be achieved at the product planning stage and we have introduced a designforenvironment dfe pro
cess in which we evaluate how well we did in and after the design stage


primary environmental performance features

below are some of the representative environmental performance features that we evaluate as part of our dfe process


                we explore various hardware and software approaches to save energy these can include anything from devel
                oping energyefficient basic technologies to implementing lowpower product control schemes we strive to
                realize lowpower products by setting and attaining concrete numeric targets several years out for each model




                epson sets concrete size and weight targets for products since reducing these helps to significantly mitigate
                environmental impacts not only because fewer materials are consumed but also because products can be
                transported and warehoused more efficiently we also make every effort to design products so as to minimize
                wastes on the customers end we do this by for example minimizing the amount of packaging used for prod
                ucts and consumables or by providing new printing functions that eliminate unnecessary prints

                we design our products to be easy to recycle after use specifically we try to achieve a recyclable rate1 of 75
                or better as estimated from product engineering drawings
                1
                    recyclable rate recyclable materials as a percentage of total product weight excluding materials used as reducing agents in blast furnaces or as fuel sources




                epson standards specify substances that are prohibited from inclusion in products and substances whose
                inclusion must be controlled information on these substances is gathered in a database to help ensure safety in
                all processes from design and procurement to volume production




                                                                                                                                      epson group sustainability report 2015           31

designforenvironment framework

epson prepares internal specifications provides evaluation tools and develops and commercializes products in line with work
standards that set forth rules and procedures the materialization of the environmental specifications is reviewed at each step of
the products commercialization before the item is finally sold as a product

resourcesaving features

the printer warns you when the selected paper size and type do not match the print settings and checks the actual size of the
paper so even if you accidentally select the wrong settings you can avoid wasting ink and paper you can use the copy preview
feature to check and adjust copies before printing them this helps you avoid misprints and save money


energysaving performance

equipped with a powersaving soc systemonachip the printer is compliant with
the energy star program ver 20 it saves energy using a power off timer function
and moves to a lowpower mode in a shorter period of time




reduction of global warming impacts across the life cycle

the expression premium xp620 can reduce global warming
impacts by about 31 across the product life cycle compared to
our past models thanks to a much smaller size and reduced
power requirements




  a life cycle assessment was used to calculate the global warming impacts of the product at each phase of its assumed threeyear life cycle and express this as a co2 equiva
   lent the life cycle includes material  product manufacturing distribution use by customer and disposalrecycling of endoflife products calculated assuming 5 a4size color
   documents per day per month with 20 working days a month 115v is used for calculation based on the us specifications the unit indicator by the japan ship technology
   research association is used for calculating emissions during sea transport the reduction in co2 emissions is expressed as a soccer ball equivalent wherein 1 kg of co2 is
   equivalent to the cubic volume of 100 soccer balls global warming impacts will vary depending on customer printer use




   compact design offers the customer more freedom when it comes to installation location and reduces the environmental
    impacts

product environmental information

epson is taking steps to comply with the labeling requirements in major countries around the world


compliance with environmental labels

an environmental label is a tool for making environmental declarations and providing other information about a products environ
mental features or performance the requirements for environmental labels are prescribed by various groups including the
international standards organization iso the iso defines the three types of environmental labels described below



                indicates that the product has met the criteria set by a certified thirdparty organization




                a selfdeclaration label that indicates a company volunteers environmental information about its products
                epsons ecology profiles and eco labels fall under the type ii category




                indicates that the environmental effects of a product throughout its life cycle  from raw material procurement
                through manufacturing distribution use disposal and recycling  are analyzed using lca methodology and that
                the results of such analyses are published as quantitative data the accuracy and reliability of the claimed data
                must be verified before being made public



eco labels acquired in different product categories

epsons type ii environmental labelling program

our program is used to provide environmental information about products that is both transparent and reliable in accordance
with the iso 14021 jis q 14021 standard
we have implemented programs for both eco labels and ecology profiles


eco labels

the epson group is preparing to start using eco labels from december 2009 to communicate the environmental features of our
products and services to customers in a simple and straightforward way the labels will be displayed on communication tools
such as brochures product catalogs and individual product boxes to highlight




epson ecology profiles

the environmental attributes of epson brand products are published in the form of an ecology profile for finished products
such as printers and scanners the environmental attributes of the product as a whole including but not limited to accompanying
packaging material supplies and consumables are published in the format specified by ecma3702 for electronic devices we
use our own format to provide quantitative data regarding substances included in these products

safety data sheets for printer consumables

to enable customers to safely and properly use epson products including consumable printer supplies ink cartridges toner
cartridges ribbon cartridges etc epson provides safety data sheets sds which describe a products chemical content as
well as how to operate handle and store the product

management of chemical substances in products

when choosing the parts and raw materials that make up epson products epson gives preference to lowerimpact alternatives


management of chemical substances in products

increasing international restrictions on substances used in products notably the rohs directive and reach regulation in eu
rope have made it essential to closely control the type and quantity of materials used epson systematically controls product
substance content at the purchasing production and shipping stages to ensure compliance with these restrictions


                          ask suppliers to comply with the requirements stated in the epson group green purchasing standard for
                              production materials1
                          exclude substances that are subject to legal regulatory or other restrictions and obtain information about
                              substances contained in parts and materials

                          confirm that no restricted substances are present in parts and materials before producing products analyze
                              parts and materials using xray fluorescence xrf spectrometer




                          confirm that restricted substances have not been used in products before the products are shipped



                         1
                             a written standard that sets forth requirements for the building and maintenance of a substance control system by suppliers who provide parts and materials
                              used in epson products the standard also defines requirements relating to the elimination or exclusion of legally restricted substances and requirements for
                              providing information on substances present in parts and materials



at epson our purchases give priority to goods that meet our original green product standards these apply not only to chemi
cals that go into our products but also office equipment and supplies that our workers use since april 2007 we have purchased
paper products according to the epson group paper product procurement policy wwf japan provided their expert and objec
tive input during the creation of this policy


examples of management of chemical substances in products

legal and regulatory compliance

more and more nations are regulating chemicals we investigate regulations and chemical hazards as early as possible analyze
the information we obtain and then supply products accordingly

topic 1 measures for meeting the rohs directive
epson has made compatibility with the european rohs directive2 a standard feature of our entire line of products throughout the
world regardless of whether a particular product is bound for the european market or not
in 2009 epson began an effort to replace phthalate esters dehp bbp dbp and dibp substances that are being considered
for addition to the list of restricted substances under the rohs directive as of march 2014 epson had succeeded in eliminating
these substances from all products except for a limited number in inventory and for industrial use etc applications exempted
from the rohs directive are scheduled to expire in july 2016 so epson is moving to ensure that its products remain compliant
with rohs requirements

    the european rohs directive restricts the use of the following 6 hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium polybro
     minated biphenyl pbb and polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde




                                                                                                                                                 epson group sustainability report 2015       44

global warming prevention

epsons initiatives to prevent global warming revolve around reducing co2 emissions by conserving energy and reducing global
emissions of greenhouse gases other than co2


in fiscal 2014 we set out to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 34 compared with fiscal 2006 and achieved our worldwide
target

sioncore microtfp printheads is one of epsons most energyintensive
facilities in japan the plant had used a cogeneration system cgs1 to

2014 epson replaced that cgs with three new highefficiency cgs the
new systems use less natural gas to operate and reduced the plants co2

annual savings by switching to a gas engine from a gas turbine system

amount of natural gas saved 1480000 nm3 reduction of co2 emissions 4900 tons

other case studies

whereas about 60 of the energy generated by a typical power plant is lost as waste heat and during transmission only about
15 to 30 of the energy generated by an onsite cgs is lost as waste heat in addition to generating electricity cgs also save
energy because they effectively recycle about 30 of the waste heat into energy for heating or cooling




substance management

epson uses its echem chemical data management system to centrally track information on chemical substances used at
epson sites around the world we are engaged in ongoing efforts to reduce the quantities of chemicals used and to moderate
emissions of pollutant release and transfer register prtr substances and volatile organic compounds voc


using fiscal 2006 emissions as a benchmark all epson business units managed and met their fiscal 2014 targets for reducing
emissions in addition we are building trust relationships by making our substance data available to the public and by creating
opportunities to exchange opinions with members of the local community

zero emissions

epsons zero emissions program began with an effort to recycle 100 of our waste products in 2003 all group companies in

in the 2014 fiscal year we employed control metrics benchmarked against fiscal 2006 emissions and we met our group reduc

water recycling

epson is mitigating environmental impacts and maintaining legal and regulatory compliance by focusing on water and resources
from a risk management point of view basic to this is making sure we soil and consume no more water than necessary and
recycling and reusing what we do use we work actively to increase the recycling rate of factory wastewater and comply with
stricter water quality regulations moreover we are implementing energyefficient water treatment facilities thus we seek to
reduce the overall impact of production processes


in fiscal 2014 we set out to reduce water usage by 50 compared with fiscal 2006 and we met our group reduction target

transport

epson is reducing co2 emissions by increasing the efficiency of product part and waste transportation we are making prod
ucts smaller which increases shipping efficiency rethinking our logistics centers innovating the loading and packing processes
to boost loading efficiency and reconsidering shipment departure and arrival frequencies and number of trips


the increase in co2 emissions in fy2014 resulted from a need to transport freight by air instead of ocean containers to avoid
long delays caused by port bottlenecks in the philippines and by us west coast port labor issues

environmental risk management

any environmental pollution resulting from epsons business activities could have a serious impact on residents of the surround
ing area as well as for the rest of the region or country we follow groupwide standards for pollution control and ensure that all
members are well acquainted with the ideas and laws of environmental risk management each promotion unit uses iso 14001
to identify and assess the risk of failing to meet standards or of experiencing environmental complaints or incidents in an ongoing
effort to continuously mitigate those risks


regulatory limits for oil were exceeded once during fiscal 2014 this incident was reported to the government and is being
addressed


we did not have any complaints and accidents


soil and groundwater remediation

epson is pumping and treating groundwater contaminated by chlorinated organic solvents at several sites in japan including at
its head office in addition we have barriers in place to prevent further contamination in addition treated wastewater dis
charged into sewers is monitored to ensure that it remains within 11000th of the discharge standard 03 mgliter

bioswale added to clean storm water united states

water running off pavements contains pollutants like oil and car exhaust to prevent
pollution in rivers epson portland inc epi created a marshy area next to its parking lot
for workers and visitors the feature known as a bioswale is designed to prevent pollu
tion from reaching the river system rain running off the parking lot is channeled into the
bioswale where plants and soil work as natural filters to remove sediments oils heavy
metals and other pollutants before the runoff reaches the groundwater at 45 meters in
width the bioswale treats runoff from a parking lot measuring 6900 square meters
                                                                                                the bioswale designed to filter out pollutants in

hr development

approach

epson develops and trains its human resources in line with a human resources development policy established in 1996 the
policy states that epson will support employees who have aspirations for selfactualization to connect all the companies in the
epson group with people and to nurture employees so that both corporate and individual objectives are met we provide
training so that our people understand their roles and what is expected of them as members of the epson team training enables
them to work and communicate effectively solve problems and achieve goals and experience personal and professional growth


in fiscal 2012 epson introduced a new personnel system that specifies clear roles and requirements for management in terms of
both business and conduct to ensure the efficacy of the system epson has implemented a training program that aims to ensure
that managers acquire two essential management skills in one course they learn our strategic business objectives and acquire
the skills that allow them to rapidly and nimbly respond to internal and external changes in the business environment in the other
course they acquire the skills that enable them to support the growth and development of the people who report to them by
putting organizations and individuals in a position to succeed


epson also conducts group trainings for new hires junior staff and others in premanagement positions to develop talented
people for future management positions

practicing offthejob training on the job

a feature of human resource development at epson is that we provide levelbased group training at every juncture along the
career path from entry level jobs through management and give employees a chance to put into practice on the job the knowl
edge they acquire


after completing group training new hires undergo a oneyear practicum other employees who complete other group trainings
undergo a threemonth practicum during the practicum employees prepare action plans based on what they learned and put
these plans into action on the job under the supervision of their supervisors thus enhancing their ability to use the knowledge
and skills they learned during training in their actual jobs


epson has used a management by objectives systems for more than 30 years managers and their subordinates work together
to set objectives that they can both agree on progress toward the objectives is periodically reviewed end results are evaluated
and new higher objectives are set the management by objectives system is itself an onthejob human resource training sys
tem it is a winwin development cycle in which individual growth leads to growth of organization and company

training for new employees in japan

epson considers the first year of employment to be a training period during which new
employees learn about the epson approach to work for the first three weeks new
employees in epson group companies in japan gather at the head office for group
training where they learn the following


 conduct expected of them as epson employees
 the mindset and attitude necessary for practicing monozukuri or the art and sci
  ence of manufacturing which is the foundation of epsons compact energy saving
                                                                                                                                                                                                       training to think about customer satisfaction
  and highprecision technologies
 the importance of working cooperatively as a team

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  epson group sustainability report 2015   58

training ranges from lectures on the epson code of conduct to handson training in manufacturing new employees learn the
importance and enjoyment of working in teams through group activities that take place throughout the training period


after they complete group training new employees are sent to the department where they have been assigned there they learn
their job through onthejob training under a mentor mentors are usually selected from among young employees with two or
three years of experience they produce training plans tailored to the individuals they will be mentoring and for a full year pro
vide them with the support they will need to stand on their own mentors themselves are expected to grow through this experi
ence


at the end of the first year the new employees gather again for followup group training where they can observe how they and
others have grown and developed to further solidify the foundation they have built as a business professional they review the
previous year and consider action plans for the next year and beyond to achieve further growth and expand their contributions to
the company


creating value that exceeds customer expectations and the monozukuri juku

epsons monozukuri juku one of the departments in seiko epsons head office is an inhouse manufacturing school that aims
to contribute to the enhancement of customer value to this end we teach our staff basic technology and skills and let them
experience monozukuri the art and science of manufacturing by performing certain manufacturing tasks step by step this
helps employees tackle jobs from a number of different angles specifically the monozukuri juku teaches the basics of compo
nent processing molding and pressing to provide requiring employees with the skills needed to produce a variety of the parts
that go into epson products it also provides them with the skills and experience necessary to automate and otherwise increase
the efficiency of manufacturing lines


mechatronics training for building maintaining and enhancing automated lines

factory productivity improvement initiatives are nothing new at epson earlier examples included the introduction of machines
and jigs to production processes more recently however we are facing great changes in the manufacturing environment par
ticularly outside japan it is not always easy to secure the necessary labor because wages have risen rapidly and many workers
prefer nonmanufacturing jobs earlier improvements were based on the assumption there would be plenty of inexpensive labor
and our business could face difficulties if we simply try to repeat those measures therefore we are making a strong push to
build production lines that do not overly rely on human labor but are still capable of ensuring stable production


monozukuri juku offers training in the basics of mechatronics which includes basic technologies like compressed air and electri
cal control as well as assembling and adjusting simple devices in december 2014 basic training was expanded to include an
allprocess training that covered essentials for stepping up the pace of automation material feeding and removal robots image
processing mechanics and more this training is given to mechanical and maintenance engineers in japan and manufacturing
and machinery maintenance leaders in other countries

developing young technicians through technical skills olympics

as a manufacturing company epson in japan uses training for technical skills olympics competitions to develop groundbreak
er technicians who quickly acquired essential manufacturing knowledge and skills and have the ability to break from precedent
to create innovative technologies and systems as a rule individuals are allowed to take part in technical skills olympics train
ings just once the purpose of the shortterm intensive trainings is to help participants learn technical skills at the alljapan level
every year epson sends 1015 individuals to the national technical skills olympics to compete in seven selected categories that
are applicable to our business instrument making press tool making mechatronics industrial electronics web design it
network system administration and watch repair


new employees sent to monozukuri juku as technical skills olympics trainees experience monozukuri the art and science of
manufacturing in such forms as rasping and cutting by blade they also learn basic knowledge about machinery electricity and
other general topics staffs assess trainees strong points during this process and assign trainees to certain positions trainees
then proceed to training specific to their positions in conjunction with everyday occupationspecific training there are training
camps three times a year participants lodge together run a 40 km road race join group discussions set targets and the like all
of this helps to build a sense of solidarity as team


to recreate the feel of the national competition epson also holds joint training events with other companies that take part in the
technical skills olympics additionally our employees actively pursue national qualifications for machining technicians electronic
device assembly technicians web design technicians and watch repair technicians after participants finish technical skills
olympics training they get practical training to help them build the basic skills learned there into skills they can use to make
products each participant then joins an operations division the units they join often praise these employees for performing
beyond expectations


because the above events are limited to those eligible to take part in technical skills olympics we hold further practical mono
zukuri trainings about 100 times a year that are open even to those who do not participate in technical skills olympics training
these help to raise the overall level of the young employees who are epsons future focuses include mechanical drawing com
ponent measurement operation of generalpurpose machine tools such as lathes and milling machines as well as nc process
ing machines and grinding machines mold manufacturing and robot safety

epson introduced a wellbeing leave program in march 1998 that
allows employees who do not use all their annual paid vacation days during the year to stockpile the remainder up to 60 days in
a separate account they have the option of using wellbeing leave days in the event of personal injury or illness or to care for
children or family members or to participate in school events for their children in elementary and middle school


monitoring and controlling working hours

epson remains fully compliant with labor laws one of the ways we ensure compliance is by following an operations manual that
epson created to prevent excess overtime work we have also deployed time management initiatives and monitoring systems
across the organization epson has programs to build awareness among employees of the importance of regulating working
hours appropriately and we are fully committed to maintaining a wellbalanced working environment


worklife balance initiatives

epson with one eye trained on the wellbeing and development of our children allows employees to
balance their careers with their personal lives so that they feel they can stay with the company we
enforce a noovertime eighthour workday at least once per week at our sites and an increasing
number of sites have a day each year when parents can bring their children to work because of
these and other initiatives epson is recognized for implementing policies that will benefit the next
generation


additionally since october 2005 we have offered an athome childcare service for employees
                                                                                                                        nextgeneration accreditation

have a career can play an active role after a oneyear trial period epson updated this program in
october 2014 and now pays for up to 16 hours of childcare per month for those who would rather not get the service in their
own home we have set up a temporary daycare space in company housing this service is being provided on a trial basis

are the foundation of a healthy company accordingly we have instituted occupational safety and health programs around the
world so that epsons employees and partners can enjoy working as a team in the knowledge that they are safe and secure

health and firedisaster prevention this original epson program is based on occupational safety and health management sys
tems oshms that conform to international labour organization ilo guidelines since that program came into effect epson
has endeavored to conform to the basic nesp policy and manage workplaces with the idea that every workplace is responsible
for maintaining its own safety epson also partially revised its policies in june 2014 now group sites act autonomously to raise
the level of their health and safety management even higher

health information this meeting helps to build partnerships among six sites in five south
east asian countries the second such meeting took place in january 2015 at epson preci

managing sanitation in employee cafeterias

a food poisoning incident occurred in one of our employee cafeterias in 2011 this
prompted periodic inspections of kitchen sanitation management at employee cafeterias
in business sites in japan kitchen sanitation supervisors and other related staff work
together during these inspections we are stepping up and continuing initiatives to im
prove the state of sanitation management and fix any facility problems the risk is not
only in japan if a serious food poisoning incident were to happen at an employee
                                                                                               inspecting the state of food storage
cafeteria at a largescale manufacturing site overseas especially in china or southeast       in a storage area china

asia it could seriously impede business continuity therefore epson is also taking
steps at manufacturing sites outside japan to manage sanitation and risk


as of fy2014 sanitation supervisors from the head office in japan have visited manufacturing affiliates in china indonesia
malaysia singapore and the philippines working with local staff they check cafeteria sanitation in those places they help local
staff identify sanitation management issues for themselves and systematically improve on them the effort has improved cafete
ria sanitation management at each of these sites

to business continuity going forward

epson group procurement guidelines was created to enable us to sustain a continuous supply of products that please custom
ers toward this end the guidelines reflecting international imperatives state epsons quality cost and delivery expectations as
well as our expectations for conducting business in line with csr requirements in areas such as human rights labor the environ
ment ethics and health and safety and in partnership with our suppliers


in april 2015 we issued rev 32 of the epson group procurement guidelines by reflecting the revision of the eicc code of
conduct and updating certain parts in line with the requirement in the code for the usage of more concrete and detailed expres
sions


to our suppliers

our idea of a partnership is a relationship in which both epson and its business partners throughout the supply chain exist
sidebyside and share a common set of values that bind us together in a cooperative mission to fulfill our social responsibility


to fulfill our social responsibility as a supply chain we ask you our valued suppliers to understand the guidelines and give us
your full cooperation

conflict minerals

conflict minerals in epson products


epsons policy on conflict minerals

epsons procurement policies are designed to develop mutually beneficial trusting relationships with its business partners around
the world based on the concepts of fairness coexistence transparency and coprosperity epson has thus committed itself to
maintaining high ethical standards and a social conscience and has declared that it will conduct its procurement activities in
strict compliance with both the letter and spirit of laws and regulations in every country and region in which it operates


epson considers the conflict mineral problem to be a major issue in terms of socially responsible procurement consequently we
do not use conflict minerals as they are tied to human rights abuses environmental destruction and the funding of armed
groups in the democratic republic of the congo drc and adjoining countries


epson takes the following actions to exclude conflict minerals from epson products


1 we ask our suppliers to read and follow the procurement guidelines and the epson supplier code of conduct we take
  additional opportunities to explain and gain their understanding with regard to actions we take to keep conflict minerals out of
  our products


2 epson is not required to report to the us securities and exchange commission about the use of conflict minerals as defined
  in the final rules of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act
  however we do survey our supply chain using a tool provided by the conflictfree sourcing initiative cfsi a group that is
  working with enterprises to promote responsible mineral procurement if in the future a more effective means of carrying out
  due diligence on conflict minerals is established we will adopt it and ask our suppliers to do so as well


3 epson requires its supply chain to provide proof of compliance that minerals are procured only from smelters and refiners that
  have been found to be compliant with the conflictfree smelter cfs program of the cfsi


main initiatives to date

 in september 2012 we asked our suppliers to abide by a clause concerning responsible mineral procurement that we added to
  the epson supplier code of conduct which is found in our procurement guidelines
 in september 2013 we set up a crossorganizational conflict minerals review committee made up of personnel from all ep
  sons operations divisions and from the procurement departments of epson group companies organization and administra
  tive oversight is provided by the seiko epson head office department that supervises socially responsible procurement under
  the direction of the committee epson has switched from a passive to a proactive approach to conflict mineral surveys
 in the 2013 fiscal year we conducted conflict mineral surveys using the cfsi template for the main products in every business
  of every business segment
 in the 2014 fiscal year we expanded the conflict mineral surveys to include all companies from whom we purchase production
  materialsapproximately 950 suppliers around the globeand had a 96 response rate however despite analyzing survey
  answers and performing due diligence we were unable to determine whether minerals were procured from sources not en
  gaged in conflict
 we asked suppliers to understand and cooperate in our responsible mineral procurement efforts at a meeting held in april
  2015 to brief them about epsons procurement policies




                                                                                                    epson group sustainability report 2015   82

initiatives in 2015 and beyond

we found from the surveys performed to date that there is room for improvement in terms of answers to survey questions in the
2015 fiscal year we will continue to survey suppliers mainly those who supplied problematical answers those who responded
that they were unable to identify all smelters and those who are new for us we at epson will continue our efforts to deepen
supplier partnerships improve the accuracy of survey answers raise the rate at which smeltersrefiners are identified and in
crease supply chain transparency


going forward we along with our suppliers will seek to help curb human rights abuses in the democratic republic of the con
go and adjoining countries by continuing to pursue initiatives that are designed to exclude conflict minerals profits from the sale
of which are used to fund armed conflict from epson products




                                                                                                    epson group sustainability report 2015   83

internal rules that set forth criteria for selecting suppliers to help us to ensure that a prospective new supplier will be able to
provide us with a stable supply of quality parts and raw materials at a fair price


once a year we also conduct a general evaluation of suppliers with whom we regularly do business these periodic general
evaluations are used to evaluate a suppliers performance in management environmental management quality management
cost management and delivery deadline management so that we can ensure stability of supply if a supplier receives a poor
evaluation we ask the supplier to provide us with a corrective action plan we then reevaluate the supplier and provide feed
back on the results this process helps lay the foundation for a stronger relationship

held at seiko epsons hirooka office students from various universities worked togeth
er on a project under the instruction of a seiko epson designer the program is de
signed to give them meaningful experience and insight into the design world
                                                                                               interns tackling a project

the advantage of an internship over the classroom said one intern is that it offers a
unique opportunity to learn the mental approach to design not just technique others reported that the internship was a valuable
experience because it made them think about how they need to approach design work before they enter the workforce
