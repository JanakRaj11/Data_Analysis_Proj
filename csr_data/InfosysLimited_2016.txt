keeping the momentum
during the year we continued our focused efforts in resource conservation
renewable energy and emission reduction and offset some of our key
initiatives that were undertaken in this year are as follows 

energy
command center
we continue to integrate our systems and buildings with our command center
to enable online monitoring and to achieve operational excellence during
fiscal 2016 all our campuses across india have been interlinked through
the central energy management system cems by integrating more than
3000 energy meters from various systems also sms alerts for lighting and
computer power consumption during unoccupied hours have been enabled
to take immediate corrective actions and eliminate wastage the command
center now has utilitywise hvac ups lighting raw power and miscellaneous
energy performance benchmarking for all our buildings based on accurate
                                                                                 comfy application helps employees control their workplace ambience
data as part of our ongoing smart water metering program we have deployed
smart water meters and linked them to our central command center for             radiant cooling in our new buildings
continuous monitoring of water use across different locations in real time
                                                                                 infosys pioneered the radiant cooling technology in india and demonstrated
significantly optimizing water consumption
                                                                                 with adequate data that it is a viable solution for cooling buildings in an
personalized comfort through comfy                                               energyefficient way we strongly believe that the radiant cooling technology
in our constant endeavor to enhance employee comfort and productivity           can bring about a transformation in the way we cool our buildings thus we
we have piloted a smart personalized workspace monitor at the infosys sdb        continue to implement this technology in our new buildings across campuses
5 mysore called the comfy application comfy is an application that helps    today we have a total area of 26 million sq ft with radiant cooling across
employees to warm or cool their workspace according to their needs and           seven buildings in five different locations in india

using smartphones laptops or desktops comfy works over the building
management system and provides instant streams of cool air or warms the          the radiflux cooling solution with patents pending in the us europe and
space and learns from occupant feedback employees act as sensors allowing      india has been designed and developed by infosys to address the challenges
comfy to save energy by eliminating overconditioning and turning off air        with existing radiant cooling systems the first set of radiflux panels were
conditioning in unoccupied spaces this systemlevel automation has been         installed in one of our buildings in bangalore and we continue to implement
done for the first time in india and has empowered the employees to control      it in buildings across different locations this year we have installed radiflux
their comfort environment improving their building experience

global warming and climate change at infosys we have been accounting and         direct and indirect based on the following criteria

to reduce our carbon emissions through specific initiatives in 2011 we             controlled by the reporting entity
have taken a big leap by committing our india business to become carbon             indirect ghg emissions are emissions that are a consequence of the activities

in fiscal 2016 we reduced our per capita water consumption by 1220 over        wastewater treatment
the last year at our india locations we have reduced our per capita fresh water
consumption by 4141 as of fiscal year 2016 against the baseline figure of       all the wastewater at our campuses is treated and reused for toilet flushing
fiscal year 2008 at our india locations                                          landscaping and in cooling towers the use of treated water is also optimized

are not undertaken we will soon be a waterstressed economy it is vital to        to have a big impact on water consumption levels we believe that smart
add value to water by metering and monitoring the consumption and being            water metering and monitoring will play a crucial role in conserving large

infosys strives to become water sustainable and has implemented a host of
efficiency measures to optimize water use to the highest possible levels for
us data is critical as a result we have installed smart water metering program
on a massive scale to enable online monitoring of water consumption and
identify leakages wastages and opportunities for reduction these full bore
electromagnetic meters facilitate granularlevel metering and monitoring
of water consumption in real time and ensure accurate measuring of water
flow these electromagnetic flow meters are integrated with the building
management systems which are remotely monitored through the command
center in bangalore campuses with smart water metering have an online
water balance to measure water distribution and consumption points water
flowing into sewage treatment plants and also recycled water operations
data flowing into the command center from various sources is used to
review and optimize water consumption and perform leakage detection and
diagnostics

smart innovative user interface has helped us identify areas of unaccounted
water consumption leading to significant water savings for example in our
pune campus we were able to reduce our per capita water consumption by
about 24 compared to fiscal 2015 by identifying and plugging leakages
                                                                                    smart water meter for online monitoring of water consumption

case in point  energy through food waste
rapid urbanization has increased the amount of waste generated by                  the plant is estimated to generate about 140 m3 of gas per ton of food waste
households and businesses turning landfills into hazardous and unmanageable       compared to regular biogas plants with about 70 m3  ton our biogas plant
spaces untreated food waste generates methane which may lead to severe           in bangalore campus has seen an actual production rate of 235 m3  ton
environmental impact and may lead to contamination of water soil and             which is equivalent to 117 kgs of lpg this translates to an attractive payback
