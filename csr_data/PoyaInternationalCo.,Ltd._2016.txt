    electricity usage in 2014 taking advantage of aggressive energysaving programs the average electricity usage of each poya
    store decreased by 67 since 2012 the implementations of energy saving included

53 plan of centralized logistic center
      before introducing the centralized logistic center the                in order to effectively decrease the delivery frequencies of
traditional goods delivery process was as followed first an order   the suppliers to raise the goods delivery efficiencies and also to
made by each poya store second goods would be delivered by the      lower the emission of exhaust gas led by the goods delivery poya
suppliers to each poya store based on the order see figure 56     started the plan of centralized logistic center in 2011 taking
as poya opens new stores aggressively the goods delivery             advantage of such centralized logistic center poya can simplify the
frequencies increase enormously in 2014 poya opened 22 new          goods delivery process after the suppliers receive the orders from
stores and thus the total store number reached 109 stores taking     the stores the suppliers can directly deliver the goods to the
the delivery rate to be two times a week the annual delivery         logistic center and then the logistic center will deliver the goods to
frequencies would be up to 47 million through poyas store          each store based on the order see figure 57
expansion 22 stores are opened in 2015 and the total store number
is 131 in 2015 the frequencies increase by 18 to 55 million
compare with it in 2014                                                                                                 n suppliers

      poya attained an acceptable level of centralized distribution              the purchase goods from suppliers were received and
system from 2011 to 2013 the centralized distribution rate was             checked in distribution center and poya could order in small
raised from 37 in 2013 to 64 in 2014 however the centralized            volume to reduce the inventory in store then staffs could save their
distribution rate stayed in same level in 2015 owing to tight               time and focus on the store business such as display service and
operating capacity of distribution center                                  shopping atmosphere creating to satisfy customersfig 58
  in terms of processing management poya enacted purchase                       the distribution center in taoyuan is operated by the third
regulations with suppliers including delivery schedule the notice         party contractor because poya is getting bigger and bigger the
of entering the goods the specification of purchase and the                contractor cant grow as fast as poya due to limited resource
purchase packing rules etc                                                 therefore the resolution of planning and constructing the
