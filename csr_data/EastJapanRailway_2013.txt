thriving with communities
growing globally

although the future of the japanese economy has been uncertain in the recent years with the current economic
policies of the government of japan corporate earnings and consumer spending have continued to show upward
trends and indicate the economys gradual recovery with this positive growth as momentum it is now vital for the
country to implement specific strategies for growth through the concerted efforts of both the public and the private
sector and to take advantage of these positive trends for the expansion of the real economy in order to help
further the upward trend of the japanese economy jr east remains supportive of all measures contributing to the
vitalization of regional economies and the creation of tourist flows
it has been two and a half years since the great east japan earthquake of march 2011 and there is still a great deal
to be done in order to fully recover from the devastation since the disaster jr east has worked in coalition with the
government of japan and local municipalities to restore the railway sections along the pacific ocean which were
devastated by tsunami to date jr east has reduced the initial 400 km length of unusable track to approximately
250 km through its ongoing efforts to restore the heavily damaged lines in stages while confirming safety in the
process
in addition in order to revitalize the disaster hit areas through the power of tourism and the strength of the jr east
group jr east launched lets go to tohoku campaigns ikuze       tohoku   and holds farm fresh markets featuring the
local specialties of the tohoku area at stations in the tokyo metropolitan area
nevertheless companies cannot thrive without the support of sound and vibrant communities and as a network
industry railways will not be able to realize their full potential without the support of such communities though it
may still take some time jr east will continue to offer whatever it can in support of its aim for the fastest possible
recovery of the disaster hit areas and the revitalization of the regional economies

bonds with the local communities and the great expectations that society holds for our railway company as a
company responsible for railways as social infrastructure we have once again realized the importance of responding
to these expectations and for fulfilling our missions as a railway company as such the fundamental missions of
the jr east group ie to adhere to customer demands for safe and highquality services and to contribute to the
development of local communities will remain forever unchanged
first we remain committed to our efforts to achieveultimate safety levels      at the time of the great east japan
earthquake no passengers on board any of our trains suffered any major injury in addition to good fortune we
owe this in part to our endeavors to date to implement countermeasures against earthquakes for this reason we
will never forget this experience and remain both humble and fully prepared for the possibility of an earthquake
occurring directly beneath the tokyo metropolitan area in order to solidify our standing as an increasingly disaster
resilient railway and to steadily implement all possible countermeasures we are investing 300 billion yen for seismic
reinforcement in this area in addition while necessity and urgency for measures concerning the aging of social
infrastructure remain at the forefront jr east is also taking measures against the aging of its railway facilities through
planned repair and replacement in order to prolong the service life of these facilities furthermore through the
fy2016 completion of platform doors for stations on the yamanote line which are not scheduled for largescale
renovations jr east endeavors to increase the safety of railway transport for the whole of the tokyo metropolitan
area
second we aim to implement service quality reforms through the harnessing of teamwork from both beyond our
business divisions and with groups from within our organization as part of our goal to become no 1 in customer
satisfaction in the railway industry with this at heart we aim to take all possible measures which will enable
us to offer stable and comfortable customer transport while maintaining secure safety in our operations we
remain committed in our efforts to strategically implement our service quality improvement projects through
the reinforcement of service management for each of our railway lines to respond to the potential needs of our
customers furthermore in addition to the fy2015 planned opening of the tohoku through line and the hokuriku
and hokkaido shinkansen lines jr east plans to further expand its railway network in the tokyo metropolitan area
and between other cities
another important issue for jr east is the strengthening of coalitions with local communities in order to contribute
to the restoration of the tohoku region while continuing our efforts to restore the tsunami hit railway lines along
the pacific coast we are working to improve customer convenience through operation of bus rapid transit brt
for the kesennuma and ofunato lines and the shortening of travel time between sendai and ishinomaki through
construction of the sensekitohoku connecting line also in addition to the pokémon with you train which began
service in december 2012 we plan to introduce other concept trains such as the allseating dining car train tohoku
emotion and the steam locomotive galaxy express sl ginga tetsudo provisional name by thoroughly exploiting
the combined power of trains tourism and innovative concepts we seek to inspire people to board our trains for
therideitself and hope that it will encourage as many people as possible to visit the tohoku region through the
expansion of agriculture fisheries and forestry into six industries with the production and processing of products
we aim to contribute to the revitalization of regional economies in coalition with local communities moreover from
the perspective of stationcentral city planning and in coalition with local communities jr east aims to promote
the three strategies of largescale development of terminal railway stations such as shinjuku and shibuya stations
development of a lineside area brand chosen by consumers in the tokyo metropolitan area and revitalization of
core regional cities such as the development of the nagano station zenkoji exit


pursuing the unlimited potential of the jr east group
one of the important pillars in our management vision is that ofpursuing unlimited potential     some might consider
that railways are an outdated mode of transport with limited room for technological advancement however
i am confident that railways possess undiscovered and unlimited potential and i believe that technological
innovations hold the key to expand this potential and progress our current themes of focus for our research and
development are the advancement of energy and environmental strategies work evolution utilizing information and
communication technology ict and further increases in the operational speed of the shinkansen jr east asks its
engineers to widely study technologies from outside the company including that of other industries in order to help
us achieve breakthroughs that exceed our traditional sense of values without adhering too much to the technologies
of jr east or railways
another key point for jr east is globalization currently we are considering a wide range of overseas railway projects
in a market that is said to be worth 22 trillion yen by 2020 in todays world the railway industry is not an industry in
decline but a promising one of growth utilizing the rolling stock manufacturing capacity and maintenance and train
operations knowhow of the jr east group we aim to expand our business into the overseas railway market
above all through the new challenges presented by technological innovation and globalization we hope that each
one of our employees will amass a great deal of knowledge from both outside of the company and the country
and continue their efforts to expand their potential each one of us must boldly step out into the world in order to
unleash the full potential of the group and its employees this is what we mean bygrowing globally

 jr east group management vision v  ever onward
 jr east was established as a result of the reform and privatization of japanese national railways jnr 25
 years ago and the group is now at a crossroads of moving on into the next quarter century with this as
 an impetus and in light of major changes in our operating environment for instance as a consequence of
 the great east japan earthquake jr east in october 2012 formulated a new management vision entitled
jr east group management vision v  ever onwardthis fifth management vision since the company was
 established aims to once again renew the courses of action for the group going forward

        awareness of issues when formulating the management vision

         ties with communities and of the high expectations that society has for the jr east group as a company
         responsible for railways which are a crucial social infrastructure we have reaffirmed the mission we
         must fulfill and its importance
        our operating environment has changed dramatically as a result of the great east japan earthquake
         there is still much more work that must be done to fully recover from the earthquake moreover the
         earthquake has brought into sharp relief certain issues that japan faced even before the earthquake
         such as an aging and declining population the hollowingout of industry and the dwindling strength of
         regional economies
        japan must also tackle urgent new issues such as the accident at fukushima daiichi nuclear power
         station and persistent power shortage problems
               having positioned the great east japan earthquake as our second starting point following the reform and
               privatization of jnr we must once again ask ourselves what role we must play and how we should direct
               our evolution in light of the various challenges we face

measures against earthquakes
learning from the experiences of the great hanshinawaji earthquake of january 1995 the sanriku
minami earthquake of may 2003 and the mid niigata prefecture earthquake of october 2004 jr east
has introduced emergency train stop measures seismic reinforcement measures to its elevated bridge
columns bridge piers tunnels and station buildings taken preventive measures against derailments and
increased the number of seismometer locations thanks to these and other measures nobody on board
our trains was killed or injured at the time of the great east japan earthquake of march 11 2011
since fy2010 jr east has expanded its countermeasures and initiated the 2nd phase of its seismic
reinforcement measures including further seismic reinforcement of elevated bridge columns in addition
jr east has designated the five years from fy2013 as a priority improvement period and strives to provide
disasterresilient railways through the introduction of the following measures



      ① s eismic reinforcement measures for embankments earth cuttings arched elevated brick bridges
        and power poles and measures to prevent the collapse of station platform ceilings and walls
        if an earthquake directly strikes the tokyo metropolitan area jr east will also accelerate the
        implementation of its plans for continuing the seismic reinforcement of its elevated bridge columns
        and bridge piers

when train services were interrupted during and after the 2011 great east japan earthquake stations
were crowded with passengers in the future after confirming the safety of our facilities jr east will strive
to keep passenger restrooms and public phones open and available at stations throughout the tokyo
metropolitan area provide customers with as much information as possible and offer temporary shelter
in concourses and elsewhere at approximately 200 stations these designated stations have been listed
on the jr east website since march 5 2013 and information on temporary shelter spaces and requests
to customers has been widely publicized as station initiatives that would follow largescale earthquakes
at approximately 30 major terminal stations including tokyo and shinjuku jr east has been stockpiling
supplies including drinking water blankets and firstaid kits for children and the elderly in fy2014 this
project will be expanded to approximately 170 stations within a 30km radius of tokyo
jr east also has conducted joint drills with the local municipalities to increase our ability to support
people who are having difficulty returning to their homes in the event of a disaster affecting major terminal
stations together with local municipalities jr east is working to improve evacuation guidance methods in
the event of disasters and to be generally better prepared

jr east has been carrying out posttsunami reconstruction with the goal of resuming train operations on
line sections where safety can be guaranteed along the northeastern pacific coast services have now
resumed along the entire hachinohe line and along sections of the joban senseki and ishinomaki lines
we are advancing restoration along sections of the sensaki li ne between takagimachi and rikuzen
ono and the joban line between soma and hamayoshida by track replacement we also have the goal
of restoring service on the full length of the senseki line by the end of 2015 on the joban line section
we will commence reconstruction in spring 2014 and plan to resume service within three years from that
date for the ishinomaki line section between urashuku and onagawa we have reached agreement
with the town of onagawa and are preparing for restoration plan together with a scheme for the further
development of the town
the joban line section between hirono and haranomachi passes through the exclusion zone within a
20km radius of the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station and we have many matters to consider
regarding restoration of operations before making any decisions we will consider all aspects of
reconstruction including reviews of line sections decontamination activities implemented by the ministry
of the environment the condition of infrastructural redevelopment the situation regarding the return of
former residents and requests from local governments restoration is already proceeding between hirono
and tatsuta with the goal of service resumption in spring 2014 in line with naraha town    s decision to
allow the return of its residents
from the perspective of providing safe and highly convenient transport services at the earliest possible
date we have now established brt systems as interim methods of transport along the sections of the
kesennuma and ofunato lines where train service has not been restored brt service began on december
22 2012 on the kesennuma line and on march 2 2013 on the ofunato line
the suspension of train operations along line sections badly damaged by the earthquake and tsunami
has now been reduced from the initial 400 km to approximately 250 km as of august 1 2013 jr east
will of course continue to cooperate with both national and local government authorities to bring
about restoration of damaged railway lines as well as in plans to rebuild the area as a whole and further
develop towns while at the same time ensuring that customer safety has first priority

measures to prevent global warming
energy conservation and co2 reduction
the electricity consumed by jr east for train operations as well as for lighting and air conditioning at
stations and in offices is supplied by jr east    s own power plants and by electric power companies
besides electricity we also use diesel fuel and kerosene for diesel train operation and for air conditioning
at stations and in offices we will strive to save energy for train operation which accounts for about 80
of our total energy consumption and reduce co2 emissions in various ways

 our co2 emissions in the fiscal year ending march 2013 totaled 233 million tons an increase of 045
 million tons over the previous fiscal year this was due to an increase in the co2 emission coefficient
 co2 emitted per unit of electric power generated by power companies it was also attributable to the
 rebound effect of energysaving and other measures taken after the great east japan earthquake

 reducing energy consumed for train operations
 as of the end of march 2013 jr east had 11607 energyefficient railcars in operation this accounts for
 904 of our railcar fleet we are putting into service more newgeneration energy efficient railcars with
 features such as regenerative brakes which can convert kinetic energy during deceleration into electric
 energy and variable voltage variable frequency vvvf inverters which control motors without wasting
 electricity

 the kiha e200 type cars which entered service on the koumi line in july 2007 are the world       s first
 dieselpowered electric motor driven hybrid railcars compared with the current trains fuel consumption
 rate has been reduced by about 10 and the noise level of the trains idling at stations and accelerating
 on departure has been lowered by 2030 db also in october to december 2010 we began operating
 the hbe300 series a new type of resort train equipped with a hybrid system similar to the kiha e200
 type in the nagano aomori and akita areas

saving energy in office buildings
in response to revisions to laws and regulations saving energy in office buildings has become increasingly
important we work hard on reducing energy consumption through physical measures including the
introduction of highly efficient equipment and facilities and operational measures including temperature
management of air conditioning and diligently turning off lights
in addition given the concerns about energy supply and demand since the great east japan earthquake
we have been actively introducing led lighting apparatus which is particularly effective as a physical
measure

saving energy used by information systems
as part of our effort to save energy in office buildings since fy2010 we have been turning off power for
certain information systems equipment during nonuse hours the resulting savings were about 128000
kwh of power in fy2013 we also reduced the number of servers by combining equipment worked to
introduce energysaving products and set our businessuse pc terminals to power saving mode we will
continue our efforts to reduce energy consumption further

measures to create a sound material cycle
waste reduction and recycling
jr east generates many kinds of waste through its railway operations including daily trash removed from
trains and stations and industrial waste from our general rolling stock centers in addition restaurants
and retail stores in our lifestyle businesses produce garbage and general waste in order to reduce all
these various forms of waste jr east actively supports the approach known asreduce reuse recycle
for recycling in particular goals are set for each type of waste


recycling waste collected from stations and trains
in the fiscal year ended march 2013 93 of the trash collected from stations and trains was recycled
since trash from stations and trains contains recyclable materials we first placed separation bins in
stations we then established recycling centers in ueno omiya and shinkiba for more rigorous separation
in october 2010 to further improve recycling rates we consolidated the recycling centers in ueno and
shinkiba and built the jr east tokyo materials recycling center operated by east japan eco access co
ltd

biodiversity
hometown forestation program
in 2004 in order to protect biodiversity and contribute to a sustainable society while cherishing our
sense of gratitude to nature we began the hometown forestation programs to plant trees native to each
region and revitalize the forests
we undertook these programs with the cooperation of fukushima prefecture from 2004 to 2009 and
with the cooperation of niigata prefecture and the town of tsunanmachi in 2010 in addition in other
areas served by jr east we are planting trees that are native to the areas and we shall continue to do the
same in the future

forest development along railway lines
beginning in 1992 we have been engaged in tree planting activities along the jr east railway lines by
fiscal 2013 a total of 46 thousand people had participated in planting about 315 thousand trees today
we have gone beyond the wayside and do tree planting in cooperation with the communities


development of railway trees
along some jr east railway lines we have railway trees planted to shield the tracks from blowing snow
and wind the first railway trees were created in 1893 for disaster prevention as living disaster prevention
facilities railway forests are playing their roles
jr east now owns approximately 58 million railway trees on a total of about 4000 hectares along our
lines at approximately 1200 locations the trees absorb 16 thousand tons of co2 equivalent to 06 of
the co2 that jr east emits in this way they also contribute to preserving the environment
in 2008 after fundamentally reviewing the role of railway trees from the viewpoints of both disaster
prevention and environmental preservation we launched a new project to plant trees to replace those
that will require replacement over the coming 20 years

railway treesfrom single to multivariety trees
traditionally railway trees were of a single variety primarily cedar trees because another function in
addition to protecting against natural disasters was to generate profits through the production of timber
this has recently been less successful however as the demand for domestic timber has declined in
future tree replacement we will plant several varieties suitable for the local climate and develop them to
be more sustainable and ecologically resilient

planting new railway trees
ceremonies for the planting of new railway trees were held in the kakizaki no 1 railway forest between
kakizaki and yoneyama on the shinetsu main line on september 27 2008 in the oitama no 2 forest
on the ou main line between oitama and takahata on july 26 2009 in the jinguji no 2 railway forest
on the ou main line between jinguji and kariwano on may 22nd 2010 and in the okama no1 railway
forest on the tazawako line on september 29th 2012 with kind advice and guidance from ecologist
and professor emeritus akira miyawaki of yokohama national university several varieties of native trees
potential natural vegetation were selected and planted many local residents and participants from
organized tours participated in the ceremonies and discovered how the trees they planted would grow
to become useful as living railway disaster prevention facilities

basic thoughts on noise reduction
improvement of the environment along railways basic thoughts on noise reduction
in the operation of trains noise is created by the train cars moving through the air by the wheels
travelling on the rails by the motors and by other sources in order to reduce noise we are working in
various ways to improve both the trains and our ground equipment
jr east also endeavors to reduce noise during maintenance work on track and structures to further
improve the environment along the lines


measures for the shinkansen
in accordance with the japanese government  s environmental quality standards for shinkansen superexpress
railway noise jr east has taken many steps to reduce this noise such as the installation of soundproof
walls and soundabsorbent materials rail grinding1 and the modification of our railcars to operate more
quietly we have already completed the implementation of measures to reduce noise levels to 75 db or
lower in densely populated residential areas along our railway lines and we plan to take further steps by
expanding the scope of areas where noise levels need to be reduced to 75 db or lower
also with the introduction of e5 series railcars which were developed based on the results of running
tests using the shinkansenfastechtest train jr east is working to improve the environment even as
we increase train speed including further reduction of noise and micropressure waves in tunnels2
    ail grinding a measure to smooth out uneven places in rails caused by wheels traveling over them this reduces noise by controlling car
1 r
   vibration
2 micropressure waves in tunnels an explosive sound caused by compressed air being forced




                                         the e5 series employs lownoise pantographs




measures for conventional lines
we have implemented voluntary measures for conventional lines to minimize noise installing long rails1
and performing railgrinding and wheeltruing2 we also comply with the japanese government  s policy
on noise measures for construction of new conventional railways or largescale remodeling when we
engage in this kind of construction or modification of our conventional lines
1 installing long rails rail joints are welded such that the length of a single rail becomes more than 200 meters with fewer rail joints these
    rails reduce noise produced at joints when trains pass
2 w heel truing a measure to grind the unevenness of wheels caused by wear to restore their circular shape



measures for maintenance work
as the maintenance work is usually done during night we give advance notice about the schedule and
details of the work to residents in surrounding areas we also make utmost efforts to minimize noise by
using modified equipment that produces lower noise furthermore by using track that is designed to
resist deformation jr east is reducing the volume of required maintenance work




                                                                        33

improvement of the environment along railway lines
restricting use of herbicides
safe train operations require regular removal of weeds along railway lines while we generally remove
them manually we also use a certain amount of herbicide we keep the usage of herbicides to a
minimum in both volume and range of use when selecting herbicides for use we select those from the
safest of the three levels of toxicity to humans and animals and from category a the safest of the five
levels of toxicity to fish
we continue to observe the rules in place in order to keep our impact on the surrounding environment
to a minimum as with our initiative to postpone the spraying of herbicides when conditions on the
scheduled day are not satisfactory for spraying in fy2013 240 tons of herbicides were used



harmony with the landscape
given that construction of a largescale railway facility or its remodeling greatly affects the local area
and surrounding environment jr east endeavors to harmonize its completed facilities with surrounding
landscapes and natural environments in the fiscal year ended in march 2012 the agatsumagawa bridge
no 3 received the tanaka award for excellent bridge work or bridge engineering from the japan
society of civil engineers in recognition of a landscape in harmony with the surrounding environment and
the national road parallel to the bridge our efforts are indeed well recognized outside of the company

chemical substance management
compliance with laws and setting goals for reduction of chemical substances
when using chemical substances the effects on human health and ecological systems must be fully
considered the jr east group not only rigidly adheres to established standard values but sets its
own ambitious targets as well as much as possible we restrict the use of such substances and adopt
substitutes that have less impact on the environment


reducing and replacing ozone depleting substances
we endeavor to reduce the use of substances specified as controlled substances under the ozone layer
protection law and adopt substitutes that have less impact on the environment
 l arge heat exchangers large cooling unitshaving steadily replaced air conditioning units using
   specified chlorofluorocarbons cfcs with systems that do not use them we completed the removal of
   such units from buildings by the end of march 2008
r  olling stockexcept for some diesel railcars all of our cars use cfc substitutes as of march 2013
   we were using 13 tons of cfcs and 89 tons of cfc substitutes we routinely check for gas leaks
   and collect the refrigerants when scrapping retired railcars in accordance with applicable laws and
   regulations
f  ireextinguishing agentalthough 67 tons of halon gas was still in use as a fireextinguishing agent as
   of march 2013 we have it under proper control and are replacing it with nonhalon agents such as
   powder agents and co2 when building new facilities or renovating existing ones


chemical substance management
as jr east uses chemical substances primarily for painting and repairing our railcars we take rigorous
steps for their use and management in order to prevent spills we are a company that handles a certain
amount of specified chemical substances and 13 jr east facilities submitted the data regarding the
release and transfer of these substances to relevant authorities in the fiscal year ended march 2013
pursuant to the prtr system
we have also been introducing stainless steel railcars that do not require painting at the end of march
2013 as many as 83 of the 11052 cars operated on our conventional lines were stainless steel railcars
beside their use for railcars we used 448 tons of organic solvents for painting railway facilities and
stabilizing track beds in the fiscal year ended march 2013

chemical substances we prepared emergency response manuals for onsite locations such as our thermal
power plants and general rolling stock centers that handle chemical and hazardous substances we are
also preparing ourselves to properly respond to any contingencies by holding workshops and training
sessions on how to handle these substances and ensuring that related information reaches all concerned
personnel

actions by tohoku construction office
in starting the operation of brt on the kesennuma and ofunato lines tohoku construction office has
successfully reduced waste and saved resources by utilizing existing facilities to decrease the use of
various construction materials
specifically the quantities of construction materials and steel were reduced by utilizing existing track
ballast as roadbed material and by using rails that had been damaged by the earthquake to strengthen
earthretaining walls we are using existing bridges instead of building new ones with the aims of
reducing costs and of maximizing the use of existing resources moreover by installing white boards inside
tunnels we can reduce the number of new lights required and thus save energy

environmental accounting and management indicators
using environmental management indicators in business activities
in the year ended march 2013 our environmental conservation costs amounted to approximately
1262billion yen in investments and 99 billion yen in expenses
of these investments costs for global environmental conservation which accounted for a large portion
were at the same level as the previous year because we continued acquiring new railcars
by introducing these new cars we estimate we will reduce co2 emissions by 84 thousand tons during
their service lives
jr east has its own environmental management indicator to assess the relation between our business
activities and environmental impacts these are calculated by dividing co2 emissions which are a major
factor in our environmental impacts by operating profits which represent our economic value added
a smaller value of the indicator means that we are making a smaller impact on the environment to create
the same economic value added for the year ended march 2013 the value of the indicator was 722t
co2 million yen compared with 945tco2 million yen for the year ending march 1991

ecoste ecostation model station

ecoste is an initiative to equip railway stations with a variety of environmental
conservation technologies such as energy conservation and renewable energy with
energy conservation     energy creation    ecoawareness and environmental
harmonizationas its four pillars the ecoste initiative was introduced at yotsuya station
chuo line in march 2011 and at hiraizumi station tohoku line in june 2012 followed
by the third model station kaihinmakuhari keiyo line in september 2013 jr east will
continue to construct ecoste model stations that will harmonize with their surrounding
geographic characteristics

largescale solar power generation facility

jr east plans to commence the operation of its first largescale solar power plant the
megasolar plant with an output of 1050 kw which has been installed on the grounds
of the keiyo rolling stock center the electricity generated will be used in the center
and will also help to operate trains by sending power to our overhead catenary with the
aim of reducing our co2 emissions the megasolar system will generate 1000mwh per
year and is expected to reduce co2 emissions by about 500 tons annually
with the aim of using solargenerated electricity to maximum effect jr east will make
use of the system to investigate the technology needed to transmit electricity to distant
places by this means

storage battery train system

jr east which has been developing astoragebatterydriven electric car systemas a
new means of reducing the burden on the environment in nonelectrified sections has
confirmed its commercial viability by running tests with its ne train new energy train
the smart dentchikun these trains are equipped with largecapacity storage batteries
electrical power is taken from overhead lines as with ordinary trains and is stored in
the batteries which provide the power needed when the train is travelling through non
electrified regions the batteries are charged at special charging facilities located at
turnback stations this train system eliminates emissions from diesel engines and also
reduces co2 emissions and noise commercial operation will begin in spring 2014
with the introduction on the karasuyama line of 2car trains in the new eve301 series
equipped with this system

 pursuingextreme safety levels
 our concept of safety
 since the establishment of jr east safety has been our top management priority and we have worked
 relentlessly to heighten our levels of safety our earnest efforts to learn from unfortunate accidents in the
 past have enabled jr east to further the prevention of future accidents with our continued developments
 both in physical and operational terms
 pursuit of safety measures can never end we will continue to work tirelessly to improve safety by
 pursuing a goal ofzero accidents involving passenger injuries or fatalities and zero accidents involving
 employee fatalities including employees of group companies and partner companies



 safety initiatives in our medium term management plan
 in the jr east group management vision v  ever onward jr east sets its eternal mission to pursue
extreme safety levels   and build a railway capable of withstanding natural disasters in order to achieve
 this we will continue our ceaseless efforts to increase the safety of our railways
 when the great east japan earthquake occurred the earthquake countermeasures that jr east had
 already been steadily implementing proved effective to a great extent however the earthquake also
 revealed issues that we must address to ensure a higher level of safety based on this experience we have
 worked to implement earthquake countermeasures in preparation for events that are conceivable such
 as an earthquake directly beneath the tokyo metropolitan area focusing on both tangible and intangible
 aspects in these ways we are working to build a railway capable of withstanding natural disasters
 we are also further promoting initiatives to prevent train collisions derailments and road crossing
 accidents at the same time we are installing automatic platform gates for the yamanote line and
 exploring the possibility of installation for other lines in these and other ways we continue to promote
 the development of railways that passenger can utilize reliably we will also bolster activities aimed at
 achievingextreme safety levelsfor example we will steadily make progress on initiatives based on
 2013 safety vision while formulating our next mediumterm safety plan



 launch of our 5th 5year safety plan 2013 safety vision
 since our establishment jr east has continued to create and implement medium term safety plans with
 the installation and further development of our safety equipment along with companywide advancements
 in safety awareness and skill we have succeeded in reducing the frequency of railway accidents
 drastically from levels at the time of the companys establishment
 in the 2013 safety vision our 5th 5year safety plan from fy2010 in addition to continuing to promote
 the measures we have implemented to date we will take on the challenge of pursuing extreme safety
 levels supported by four pillars creating a culture of safety rebuilding the safety management system
 taking sure steps to reduce risks and promoting priority improvement plans for safety equipment we will
 approach this challenge from the twin perspectives of safetyrelated human resource development and
 system improvement and not just working to prevent the recurrence of accidents after an accident has
 already happened but also evaluating possible risks to prevent accidents before they occur

 general principles of safety

   ① safety is the most important mission in transportation
   ② ensuring safety is based on exact observance of rules and procedures and is achieved through
     constant practice
   ③ enforcement of confirmation and complete contact is most important for ensuring safety
   ④ for ensuring safety we should cooperate together and go beyond our official responsibility
   ⑤ when we have questions or must choose among several options we should remain calm think by
     ourselves and take the safest course after thorough consideration

creation of a culture of safety
our 5 cultures of safety
to heighten levels of railway safety it is necessary to establish and support unwavering cultures of safety
the cultures of safety we seek are based upon accident information from the past and we learn and act
upon it in mutual trust


  ① a culture of proper reporting
    preventing the occurrence and recurrence of accidents through prompt and proper reporting of all
    accidents and incidents
  ② a culture of noticing
    the prevention of accidents through an awareness of the causes of accidents and the sharing of
    information that would prevent these causes from leading to actual accidents
  ③ a culture of direct meeting and discussion
    allowing for the open and honest exchange of opinions and discussions enables us to identify the
    causes of accidents and to take appropriate countermeasures against recurrence
  ④ a culture of learning
    continuously learning about accidents and learning from accidents and incidents which occur in all
                                   s own workplace
    places of work not just in one
  ⑤ a culture of action
    safety can be ensured only by taking safe actions think and act by yourself this is at the core of
    our safety



 sangen principle three actualities principleas a standard for action
accidents and incidents always occur at the genba this means that the sources of accident prevention
can also be found at the genba in order to suitably understand and rectify each accident or incident
jr east approaches safety issues with thethree actualities principleas its standard for action actual
locations actual objects and actual people
 genbagenbameans a field or workplace where employees actually do their physical work in construction production maintenance
   operation etc as distinguished from management or office work in industrial sectors such as construction and manufacturing



the challenge safety campaign
in 1988 we started the challenge safety campaign with the aim of encouraging our employees to actively
take on the challenge of further improving safety levels rather than just passively maintaining safety the
challenge safety campaign aims to increase our employee awareness and sense of safety we intend to
guide all employees to more safetyoriented behavior by having them think about and discuss safety act
upon it and feel a sense of achievement through doing so

head office safety campaign
every year jr east operates a head office safety campaign the campaign provides the president and
executive officers from the head office with a chance to visit field offices and hold direct discussions with
frontline employees including those at partner and cooperating companies
in fy2013 executive officers from the head office inspected nighttime maintenance work as observers
they participated with frontline employees in impassioned discussions on the themewhy it is so
difficult to place oneself in someone else s position in taking concrete actions so that we can learn from
othersmistakes in order to prevent fatal accidents which could lead to fatalities or injuries of customers
clarifying issues working on solutions and completely eliminating possible causes of accidents
through these activities jr east was able to reconfirm issues and areas of concern with field staff in
utilizing past cases for improvement at each one of their workplaces additionally based on the outcomes
obtained from these activities jr east decided to implement specific measures regarding crisis prevention
capabilities in order to further heighten the company   s awareness of safety so that all employees would
be able to think by themselves and act flexibly in the event of a disaster or major accident

            and experienced staff the most important thing in safety education is to learn from other people
            s experiences by placing oneself in their shoes so that we can learn lessons from past accidents or
            incidences that they have experienced

installing safety equipment
to prevent collisions between trains jr east has installed ats automatic train stop and atc automatic
train control systems on all of its railway lines to heighten the current safety level of train operations
even further we are installing atsp and atsps systems which employ continuous speed monitoring
functions the number of installations is steadily increasing most are in the tokyo metropolitan area
by the end of march 2013 the atsp system had been installed on 24061km of railway line the ats
ps system is currently installed on 2105km of line in the sendai and niigata regions and at 56 stations
additionally jr east replaced the atsps on the section of the senseki line between aobadori and
higashishiogama with its advanced train administration and communications system atacs a radio
controlled train operation control system in october of 2011
in response to revisions to the ministry ordinance for technological standards for railways in july 2006
we are working on measures to prevent excessive train speeds at curves turnouts and terminals and on
descending grades planned improvements at all curves that had been targeted for action were completed
by the end of march 2010

introduction of the advanced train administration and communications system atacs
train control system with radio transmission
atacs is a train control system utilizing radio transmissions by using radio communications for the
transmission of information between ground and onboard facilities the system enables the trains to be
mainly controlled by onboard equipment permitting reductions in traditionally required facilities such as
signals connecting cables and track circuits which are currently used for the detection of trains
eliminating these facilities is expected to reduce the number of facility failures and the number of
subsequent transport disruptions
jr east began using the atacs system in october 2011 on the senseki line between aobadori and
higashishiogama in december 2012 as one of our 2nd stage functions jr east released a new function
for setting provisional speed limits from 2014 onwards we plan to release another new function for
controlling road traffic at level crossings

systemization of maintenance work
when starting maintenance work on railway tracks jr east works to ensure the safety of its trains and
maintenance workers by following procedures to set signals to stop so that trains do not enter sections
of railway where maintenance work is being conducted in the past this was done mainly via telephone
from maintenance workers to stations however in order to prevent any occurrence of error including
human error jr east adopted a method for maintenance workers to operate handheld devices to change
signals to red and the devices have since been introduced to major railway sections in the tokyo
metropolitan area in the future jr east aims to continue its efforts to improve the safety of its operations
through the systemization of its maintenance work in other railway sections as well

introduction of effective rainfallas a new indicator
when there is heavy rainfall we ensure train safety through operational restrictions such as limits to train
speed and when necessary by suspension of operations for operational restrictions on conventional
lines we have been using hourly rainfall1 and continuous precipitation2 as our indices since june 2008
we have been usingeffective rainfallas a new indicator that is effective in prevention of landslide
disasters due to rainfall effective rainfall is the amount of underground water remaining after changes
over time in ground penetration and outflow using this indicator we can more precisely predict the
occurrence of landslide disasters improving the safety and reliability of our train operations
1 hourly rainfall the total rainfall over a onehour period

measures to prevent accidents at rail crossings
when the company was established in 1987 there were 247 accidents during the year at level crossings
in the fiscal year ending march 2013 the number had been drastically reduced to 34 approximately 60
of all levelcrossing accidents involve automobiles we have installed devices such as obstacle detectors
which are capable of detecting an obstacle such as an automobile stalled on a crossing and stopping
trains and we have increased the number of crossing warning devices in a higher position for better
visibility more large crossing gates have been installed the barrier arms are thicker than usual these are
expected to provide better visibility day and night in addition we are presently promoting a wide range
of public relations activities for the prevention of level crossing accidents appealing to drivers for their
cooperation and understanding
in addition for countermeasures against secondary accidents resulting from derailments at level crossings
with roads derailment prevention guards have been installed at these crossings the longterm solution is
to decrease the number of level crossings and we are cooperating with local governments neighboring
residents and the police to increase the number of overhead crossings
as examples of our most recent efforts in 2005 jr east began working to improve safety at the sojiji
temple rail crossing on the tokaido line near tsurumi station where there had been more trouble than
at other level crossings in the tokyo area because it is on a curve with restricted visibility the overhead
pedestrian crossing was rebuilt to be barrierfree and in fy2011 the level crossing was closed during
rush hours closed hours were extended to between 600 and 2100 in fy2012 and as a result of our
agreements with concerned parties from april 1 2012 this level crossing has been closed to road traffic
at all times
learning lessons from an accident at a rail crossing on the iiyama line between morimiyanohara and
ashidaki on february 1 2011 jr east has introduced a rule to stop trains at stations when the warning
signals at a crossing are being activated due to causes such as equipment failures and when pedestrians
and automobiles are allowed to cross at the rail crossing to ensure that train operations do not endanger
pedestrians or automobiles jr east also formulated a procedure for field staff to prevent failures in safety
confirmation

station platform safety
in the fiscal year ending march 2013 there were 84 accidents in which customers fell from platforms
onto tracks or came into contact with trains jr east is installing protectionrelated devices including
emergency trainstop systems on our platforms to ensure customer safety customer awareness and
cooperation are also vital to safety on our platforms and we are implementing ourzero platform
accident campaignthrough posters as a measure to heighten this awareness
as a major measure to prevent accidents to customers on platforms jr east is introducing automatic
platform gates on the yamanote line in fy2013 we started the use of these gates at osaki and
ikebukuro stations and in fy2014 at otsuka sugamo komagome shinokubo mejiro takadanobaba
and tamachi stations in fy2015 we plan to install these gates at okachimachi uguisudani tabata
yurakucho harajuku gotanda and nishi nippori stations with the exception of six stations shinagawa
hamamatsucho shimbashi shibuya shinjuku and tokyo stations which require largescale improvement
work we plan to complete installations at all stations on the line by fy2016 for routes other than the
yamanote line we plan to install automatic platform gates mainly at stations used frequently by visually
challenged customers while discussing these matters with the relevant organizations
for stations with a daily number of passengers exceeding 100000 jr east is currently working to install
an increased number of dotbraille blocks that indicate which direction is away from the edge of the
platform

measures against earthquakes
measures learned from the past earthquakes
learning from earthquakes in the past jr east has employed the following three antiearthquake
measures
① stopping trains immediately emergency train stop measures
② preventing structural damage seismic reinforcement measures
③m inimizing secondary accidents following derailment preventive measures against trains deviating from
  tracks


① stopping trains immediately emergency train stop measures
jr east has installed seismographs along coastal and shinkansen railway lines for the detection of primary
tremors pwaves our present system allows us to stop trains as soon as primary tremors are detected
from august 2012 to be prepared for possible occurrences of earthquakes jr east additionally installed
and started using its seismometers at 30 locations for earthquakes with epicenters potentially situated
directly beneath the tokyo metropolitan area and those in inland sections of its service area in october
2012 jr east began using earthquake early warning from the japan meteorological agency for
conventional lines our early earthquake alert system was introduced for the tokyo metropolitan area
in december 2007 and in all other areas in april 2009 the system enables trains in any section of track
to be stopped in the case of a major earthquake utilizing information obtained from our shinkansen
seismographs and from any advance announcements given by the japan meteorological agency


② preventing structural damage seismic reinforcement measures
in response to the 1995 great hanshinawaji earthquake jr east has been taking a number of seismic
reinforcement measures by the end of march 2008 we had reinforced all of our elevated shinkansen
viaduct support columns and shinkansen bridge columns on our conventional lines by the end of march
2009 we had reinforced all other columns in the southern kanto and sendai areas except in places that
required additional construction work currently we are reinforcing elevated bridge columns susceptible
to failure due to bending by strong earthquake motion aiming to further improve our safety levels against
earthquakes
from fy2013 to prepare for a possible earthquake directly beneath the tokyo metropolitan area we
will conduct seismic reinforcement of embankments cuttings brick arch viaducts electrical poles and
other infrastructure in addition we will implement stationplatform ceiling and wall collapse prevention
countermeasures among other initiatives including advanced plans for the seismic reinforcement of
viaduct support columns and bridge columns based on experience derived from the great east japan
earthquake we will proceed with the seismic reinforcement of railway station buildings serving more than
3000 passengers per day along with the seismic reinforcement of shinkansen electrical poles


③ minimizing secondary accidents following derailment
  preventive measures against trains deviating from tracks
during the niigata chuetsu earthquake in 2004 one of our joetsu shinkansen trains was derailed while
running fortunately this derailment did not lead to any injury to either our passengers or our train crews
learning from the events surrounding this earthquake jr east has taken several measures for our
shinkansen trains and tracks for our railcars we have installed an lshaped car guide on the bogies to
restrict lateral movement of the car body for ground facilities we are improving the shape of joint bars to
lessen the impact of wheels on rail joints in the case of a derailment and implementing countermeasures
to prevent the overturning of railcars and the lateral movement of rails if metal rail fasteners are damaged
by a derailment
nevertheless during the great east japan earthquake in march 2011 one of our trains in test operation
derailed after its regular inspection based on the results of the investigations conducted with our
shinkansen railcars and tracks we will continue to seek further improvement of our safety measures

measures taken since the accident on the uetsu line
on december 25 2005 the limited express train inaho no14 derailed between sagoshi and kita
amarume stations near the no 2 mogamigawa bridge we would like to report on the measures we
have taken since this accident


increased number of anemometers wind meters
jr east has increased the number of anemometers at the accident site between sagoshi and kita
amarume stations in addition for sections with operational restrictions when there are strong winds we
established multiple anemometers as our new standard and increased the number of anemometers in
locations where windbreak fences were installed by reconfirming the requirements for wind restrictions
on sections of railway lines using information from frontline employees topography and wind conditions
of the areas and adding new operation restriction sections we are working to improve our safety
observation network to counter the effects of these strong winds with this reinforcement since the
accident jr east has installed a total of 599 anemometers for its conventional and shinkansen lines and
the total number of anemometers installed as of march 31 2013 was 916 758 on conventional lines and
158 on shinkansen lines

expanded introduction of a gale warning system
we have been adding to our gale warning system to raise the level of safety by restricting operations
not only when the actual wind speed measured by anemometers exceeds restriction thresholds but
also when the projected maximum wind speed exceeds these limits jr east has installed gale warning
systems in all of the 297 locations on its conventional lines with gale operational restrictions


introduction of a method to properly assess the effect of wind force on railcars for
operational restrictions
the effect of wind force on railcars is constantly changing for this reason jr east has been studying
methods to properly assess the effects of wind on railcars and utilize the results to more accurately
impose operational restrictions for increased safety in train operations together with consideration for
the opinions of experts in the field jr east has been studying the following
① more accurate methods of wind observation using anemometers
② calculation methods for the yield strength of railcars against wind through considerations for track
   conditions and car body shape
jr east introduced these new methods for some sections of the uetsu main line the keiyo line and the
echigo line



utilizing meteorological information to test methods for operational restrictions
local gusts are meteorological phenomena and are difficult to observe with conventional observation
equipment such as anemometers through meteorological information obtained from the japan
meteorological agency radar and by detecting the passing of cold weather fronts and the accompanying
development of cumulonimbus clouds we have been investigating how to forecast the occurrence of local
gusts and to apply that information to our operational restrictions from fy2008 the system was tested
during the winter on the uetsu main line between niitsu and sakata and on the hakushin line between
niigata and shibata on february 17th 2009 we added the system to sections of the uetsu main line
shinetsu main line echigo line yahiko line and rikuu west line for additional testing additionally from
fy2013 we have added the japan meteorological agency        s nowcast that supports detection of tornados
as a condition for issuing alarms for our train operations
during this six year period of testing though we initiated train operational restrictions for a total of twelve
days we did not observe any actual occurrence of local gusts


research of a doppler radar observation method
we are currently investigating the possible utilization of a doppler radar observation method to help
identify local gusts as information to be used for operational restrictions doppler radars can determine
wind conditions by detecting the movements of raindrops and rain clouds and are used at some airports
for detecting local gusts
since 2007 we have conducted local gust observations using a doppler radar with the system
constructed in 2010 as a basis for a local gust detection system we started realtime local gust detection
experiments at amarume station on the uetsu main line while conducting ongoing validations and
improvements through experimental monitoring of the local gust detection system we will advance our
research on the application potentiality of the system for train operation restrictions

twoway communications
jr east considers it necessary not simply to await information from customers but also to be active in
ascertaining what they really need we therefore strive to discover their potential opinions by making use
of social media thejr east official facebook   launched in may 2012 will provide information about
our various campaigns and proposals
as the times and environment change customersdemands change constantly to address such changing
needs we learn about customersdemands from their comments and use this information to develop
specific improvements it is through such twoway communications with our customers that we endeavor
to upgrade our service quality


prompt service quality improvements with customer comments at the core
customer comments are considered at various levels within the company initially a decision as to
whether or not some action of improvement is necessary is made at the level that initially received the
original customer comments the action will reflect this decision if action is difficult to take at that level
then the comments are passed on to higher levels where potential improvements can be discussed
at the very top level we have also established the customer comments committee chaired by the
president which considers the possible implementation of improvement measures based on collected
customer comments through this system we are constantly striving for the attainment of improved
customer services

  what is the customer comments committee

    chaired by the president the committee discusses the necessity of improvements requested by
    customers and specific solution measures that will ultimately lead to speedy improvements



sq network
based on one of the three pillars of the mediumterm vision for service quality reformsprompt
improvements in the quality of our services that reflect customer comments with the entire group
working as a single teamour company and group companies closely involved in transport service
established the sq service quality network in october 2011 the sq network holds meetings of
representatives of jr east and group companies at stations branch offices and the head office to share
customerscomments and devise solutions and improvements through teamwork that goes beyond
individual departments or group companies in this way the jr east group as a whole can dedicate itself
to enhancing customerssatisfaction


customer satisfaction surveys
we conduct customer satisfaction surveys via our jr east customer questionnaires to enable us to gain
an understanding of how customers evaluate our services that we cannot get simply through customer
feedback and to quantitatively check levels of customer satisfaction the survey results are used to decide
which issues jr east should most urgently address as well as to confirm the efficacy of previous measures

wayside monitors
we instituted a wayside monitors system beginning in fy2012 to gain a more specific understanding
of the needs of our customers and of the way they use our services on each of our railway lines this
is in addition to customerscomments we receive daily and our jr east customer questionnaires we
have recruited the monitors from among our customers who live along our railway lines and sought their
views through questionnaires on the internet and interviews to understand their needs from different
perspectives so that we can increase the attractiveness of living alongside or near our railway lines
surveyed sections yokohama saikyo and keiyo lines in the fiscal year ended march 2012 and the
musashino line in the fiscal year ended march 2013




quality services that reassure customers

creation of a safe environment
the provision of safe and reliable transport is the basis of service quality to achieve this jr east works
constantly to increase service reliability and creating an environment in which passengers can travel free
of worry


improvement in transport quality
jr east constantly works to prevent transport disruption to improve our postdisruption response abilities
and to provide passengers with better information


prevention of transport disruptions
to increase service reliability we are implementing physical measures designed to prevent transport
disruptions including railcars with dual systems track switches of nextgeneration design equipment to
reduce lightning strike damage to electric facilities and windbreak fences
 railcars with dual systems railcars with increased reliability through duplication of major equipment




early resumption of operations after transport disruptions and prevention of disruption on
connecting lines
for early resumption of operations we maintain our preparedness for quick responses at all times
including drills to deal with fatal accidents and rescue passengers
to prevent transport disruption impacts on other sections we are adding facilities for turning trains
back so that normal schedules can be maintained where there is no direct effect from the cause of the
disruption


turnback operation
when a transport disruption has occurred we try to turn trains back before they enter the disrupted
section so that the impact of the disruption will not extend to other sections
we will work also to reduce the impact of disruption on transport by readying necessary equipment
utilizing existing equipment and reviewing rules to enable turnbacks




                                                                       62

learn lessons from transport disruptions and use the lessons at the worksite level
when a disruption has occurred each worksite involved reflects on how it was dealt with learns the
lessons from this and uses the knowledge to study and implement measures to prevent recurrences
these measures at different work sites are widely disseminated to other worksites so that individual
employees may improve their knowledge



information enhancement
we are developing methods so that if there is a transport disruption we can provide our customers with
prompt and accurate information at frequent intervals while we work to restore normal service we are
taking steps to provide our customers with faster and better information about service when there are
accidents resulting in casualties the anticipated time at which the service should be resumed will be
announced within ten minutes of the suspension having occurred with subsequent updates depending on
the situation in the meantime we will continue to install emergency information displays as of the end of
fy2013 such displays were installed in 151 stations as tools for providing our customers with transport
information in addition we provide information through varied media such as through onboard led and
liquid crystal displays the jr east home page on the internet and cell phone service our homepage now
provides details of service suspensions of express trains on conventional lines as well as supplying other
operationrelated information we are endeavoring to provide a wider range of information and extend
the time in which delay certificates can be issued on major lines in the tokyo metropolitan area these
services will form part of the more comprehensive information system that we are developing with the aid
of ict information and communication technology




            information display during transport disruptions
                                                                     information on the website




problem prevention measures taken by the facilities section
we are working to lessen the impact of transport disruptions with priorities on a reduction in the actual
number of incidents rapid restoration of services when incidents do occur and the provision of accurate
customer information in the facilities section in particular in order to reduce the severity of problems
and failures we are strengthening or duplicating facilities to make them less likely to cause problems
established a restoration base and increased our supply of replacement parts for essential equipment
these initiatives have resulted in a downward trend of transport disruptions in the tokyo metropolitan
area we will continue to strive for a reduction in transport disruptions by analyzing past occurrences and
by facility strengthening measures including both tangible and intangible aspects




                                                               63

 from station renaissance to machizukuri city planning

 since 2000 station renaissance has focused for about a decade upon maximizing the value of
 its stations by implementing zerobased reviews of the layout of their existing facilities while
 in the process of transforming them into barrierfree and earthquakeproof station buildings
 following the completion of this task and in view of changes in social environment such as
 a decreasing ageing population and falling birth rate accompanied by the increasingly high
 standards expected of railway networks and stations by local communities it is important for
 us to concentrate our attention uponmachizukuri         city planningcooperating with local
 communities and utilizing our joint resources
 at tokyo station currently under development into a complete city the yaesu side is now
 under redevelopment following the completion of the marunouchi station building preservation
 and restoration work in october of last year combined with ekinaka business hotels offices
 commercial facilities and educationalresearch functions all of which have long tradition
 and innovativeness tokyo station will play a prime role as a core facility in the city plan at
 manseibashi between kanda and ochanomizu stations on the chuo line an environmentally
 friendly office building was constructed on the site of the old transport museum and a
 new walking route was constructed by building a riverfront deck while the remains of the
 manseibashi station building and the redbrick viaduct have been conserved using valuable
 community resources this project was designed to revitalize communities by providing a place
 where people from the akihabara kanda sudacho and awajicho areas can meet and by
 reminding them of the old manseibashi station in close cooperation with local communities
 other development projects using local resources are also under way such as the conversion
 of a lightlyused station building into a hotel hotel rmets utsunomiya guides customers to
 surrounding tourist spots by utilizing local resources such as interior décor using local oya stone
 and displays of prefectural traditional handicrafts
 city planning around a station including the construction of station forecourt and service

tokyo station was first established in 1914 in year three of japan
history could be passed on to future generations in october 2012 the station was opened
anew bearing both the spirit of tradition and of innovation

seismic technologies employed in the restoration of the tokyo station marunouchi building
the permanent preservation and utilization of the tokyo station marunouchi station building
after its restoration meant that improvements in its seismic capabilities were essential for this
reason jr east conducted seismic isolation retrofit work of a scale unprecedented in the history
of japan 1
in the restoration work we used temporary supports to support the existing station building
above the ground while removing the original foundation of 11000 pine piles which have
supported the station building since it was built in doing so we succeeded in creating a new
underground space that could be used for the seismic isolation layer between the above
ground part of the building and the newlycreated underground part the vibration control
system employs approximately 350 isolators 2 and approximately 160 oil dampers 3 to lessen
the amount of deformation of the station building in the event of an earthquake utilization of
seismic isolation retrofitting meant we were able to restore and preserve the tokyo marunouchi
station building while providing it with greatly improved seismic resistance
1 seismic isolation retrofit method a construction method for providing the building with seismic isolation in which vibration
    control systems are installed in the foundations of an existing building or at the mezzanine without affecting its exterior
    appearance interior decorations or facilities
2 isolators these support the weight of the building under ordinary conditions during an earthquake these can transform a
    shortperiod seismic wave into a longperiod seismic wave
3 oil dampers the viscosity resistance of a viscous material oil means the system is able to absorb seismic energy by
    suppressing the degree of building sway

 who are unfamiliar with japan
 the jr east travel service center opened upon the completion of the tokyo station
 marunouchi building restoration work in october 2012 the center accommodates the
 travel counter and tourist information counter where customers can exchange their
 vouchers for rail passes such as the jr east pass as well as purchase a variety of railway
 tickets located inside the tokyo station premises the tourist information counter pays
 particular attention to departure times and times required for transferring between trains
  a service not normally provided by ordinary tourist information counters given the
 size of tokyo station customers from overseas who do not speak japanese might feel
 anxious about transferring between trains or where to go to board their trains to ease
 the concerns of customers as much as possible we try to propose flexible time schedules
 for their travel and offer easytounderstand guidance
 since our opening we have hosted numerous visitors
 to japan what surprises us the most is that people
 repeatedly visit us during their stays in japan for
 instance some people come back to us to tell us
 that they liked tourist spots and hotels we suggested
 other people come back to us with their friends
 saying that they liked the service provided during their
 last stay and others approach us saying their friends
 recommended they visit us on one occasion visitors
 could not transfer in time to reach their destination
 because of a delay with their shinkansen train the
 customers came back to us to complain but when
 they left to head home our staff saw them off at the
 platform this made an impression on them and in the
 end we were complimented for our services
 at the center we might only spend a short period of
 time with our customers however as our customers
 may be anxious about traveling in japan when they
 do not speak the language we cherish every single        suimi fujiwara

relationship with employees

demonstrating the power of human resources
in order to ensure safe and reliable rail transport and provide services that will satisfy customers it
is vitally important for us to create an environment where jr east     s personnel can fully exercise their
abilities our success in enabling our people to be able to personally decide what they need to achieve
and then act on their decisions will determine the future of our entire organization

the awareness of working people and their working environments as a result of this we believe that
jr east must constantly respond to the motivation of all our employees as they work to meet their
responsibilities and thereby bring about improved safety and increased customer satisfaction
jr east continues to work to provide an environment in which all employees can enjoy their jobs while
constantly striving to attain even higher goals to that end we are determined to face the challenge of
creating a company where people grow through their work from the perspectives of how to respond to
the motivation of each employee to meet challenges how to ensure a suitable worklife balance and how
to make full use of the diversity of our human resources
injr east group management vision v ever onward         the company advocated reforms to its culture
including opening up our organization to young employees and giving to motivated people increased
opportunities to apply for inclusion in training and other new projects to exchange with people in
other companies passing on technical knowledge and skills to the next generation and participating in
technological innovation and overseas railway projects



recruitment
jr east s main supports are the capabilities of each and every employee our basic philosophy is to
employ people based chiefly on their personalities and abilities and then to steadily nurture them

retirement age in march 2014 and the constant necessity for human resources development and the
transfer of knowledge and technologies to the next generation we have recruited 1800 new employees

    systemandskills necessary for problem solving in respect of the expert knowledge of the
    assigned job we first learned the concept and the basics in class and then progressed to on
    site learning so we were really satisfied with the onsite learning and training
    students in the academy have similar intentions are highly motivated respond quickly and
    never give up though their jobs are different all students of the academy are on the same
    wavelength i wanted to be a professional track maintenance engineer but encounters with
    highlymotivated students doing different jobs made me decide that i wanted to be an engineer
    who can take care of the whole railway rather than merely of my owntrack maintenancework
    the methods of thinking and of organizing documents that i learned innecessary skills for
    problem solvingare very useful in my current job if i say that
    i can organize my plan theoretically  locating the problem
    defining it deciding how it may be solved and knowing what to
    do  i owe all that to the academy now i am always conscious
    that my thoughts are accurately understood by others and so i
    can speak with confidence it is very useful for me
    this academy which gives us time to concentrate on research
                                         and to improve our skills

of improvements in itself is an opportunity for the fostering of human resources and thereby aims to
nurture employees capable of thinking and acting independently



skills training centersdevelop engineers for future railways
integral to our efforts to ensure that experienced employees pass on their technologies and skills to
the next generation of technical staff who will carry the responsibilities for railways in the future is our
establishment of skills training centers designed to support the continuity of railwayspecific knowledge
in individual workplaces in our rolling stock maintenance center for example railway car component
mockups such as power collection equipment door openingclosing devices and braking equipment
have been set up while at our facilities maintenance center railway facilities including tracks turnouts
platforms overhead line equipment and signals have been installed so training sessions can take place in
virtually real environments by the fiscal year ending 2014 we plan to establish a total of no less than 104
skills training centers including those that make use of existing facilities

for all our employees to recognize stress in their everyday lives and deal with it promptly as a result we

care with the aim of increasing their awareness of this issue we have also set up a counseling service
in conjunction with a jr east medical facility and through this respond individually to our employees
needs in order to promote frontline care in the workplace beginning in the fiscal year ended march
2008 we also organized training programs for onsite supervisors



elder employee system
during the fiscal year ended march 2009 jr east introduced the elderly employee system that
encourages employees who have reached retirement age to continue working for group companies
that can benefit from their individual capabilities and skills this percentage corresponds to 90 of the
total through this plan we hope to enable retired employees to stabilize their lives until they reach
their fully pensionable ages as well as to encourage them to continue to contribute to our groupwide
accumulation of knowhow

independent assurance report website version




for most of the environmental data station and sales office data are
aggregated by units of branch offices and group companies and finally
calculated at head office and reported because data on all stations and
group company outlets and sales offices are subject to calculation with no
exemptions for size it is assumed that the amount of labor for calculation
and that for internal checks to ensure accurate data collection are
enormous to further improve data accuracy and data collection efficiency
i would suggest that the definitions of data to be collected should be made
clearer and communicated and the introduction of an environmental data
collection system should also be considered
in terms of information disclosure the use of the ghg protocol has grown
over the past several years in regard to the disclosure of greenhouse gas
emissions and it is becoming a common practice to classify co2 emissions      naomi sugo
as scopes 1 2 and 3 when they are presented taking these trends into         kpmg
account we believe it is worth considering presenting co2 emissions using     azsa sustainability co ltd

scopes 1 2 and 3 although the company may find it complicated to classify
emissions into scopes since part of the electricity used is generated at its
own power plants

summary from the general manager of the management planning department
during fy2013 the japanese economy continued to suffer harsh conditions
due to the slowdown of the global economy and other factors with the
introduction of domestic economic measures and significant monetary
easing however there was a gradual recovery including a rise in stock
prices and an improvement in consumer attitudes even so although it is
now two and a half years since the great east japan earthquake we are
only halfway to reaching the goals of complete recovery and restoration
including finding a satisfactory answer to the nuclear power issue
on the domestic front the second cabinet of prime minister shinzo
abe  s administration has been inaugurated and has announced the
implementation of a zerobased energy and environmental strategy review
and global warming measures while the government is actively promoting
a new energy policy including the establishment of a renewable energy          makoto takahashi

                                                                                management planning department
strategies remains uncertain regarding the issue of nuclear power               corporate planning headquarters
generation against this chaotic backdrop we as a business operator
believe that while paying close attention to future possibilities it remains
vital for us to develop appropriate and necessary market responses such
as the promotion of ecostations the pursuit of renewable energy and the
development of a new railcar drive system
on the international scene at the 18th conference of the parties cop18
to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc
held in doha in november 2012 it was decided that japan which is not
participating in the second commitment period of the kyoto protocol will
be advancing measures based on the cancun agreement from this aspect
also domestic energy and environmental strategies are coming to significant
crossroads
jr east group is very aware of its role in society and societal expectations
so we designated the great east japan earthquake as a second starting
point and in october last year formulatedmanagement vision vever
onwardunder the sloganthriving with communities growing globally
we intend to contribute environmentally to both communities and the world
by fully utilizing the environmental advantages and technologies of railways
as a result of taking social movements into account we decided to change
the title of this year s report from jr east group sustainability report to
corporate social responsibility csr report
we will continue to address global environmental issues by making active
and longterm groupwide efforts and thereby contribute to the creation
of a sustainable society only in this way will the jr east group continue to
