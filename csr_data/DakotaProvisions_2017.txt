governance and our commitment to corporate responsibility
the strategic plan incorporates a balanced approach needed to realize a 10 per year average annual foreseeable growth in volume without sac
rificing the health of the environment or the community in which it operates and serves we follow gaap standards usdafsis regulations fda
regulations and epa regulations we use the everify ssnvs social security number verification system and background screening as part of
our evaluation process for applicants before they are hired we have a signed image agreement with the department of homeland security
dhs our shortterm goals include maintaining quality standards enforcing security mechanisms managing natural market volatilities and sus
taining a strong workforce the companys longterm production and financial strategy is fixed on distributing 80 of its volume to be sold as
further processed fully cooked product and 20 to be sold in a raw form and in 2017 we will work harder at moving closer to this goal at the
end of 2016 we were at 34 further processed fully cooked product and 66 sold in a raw form as poultry processing generally carries a num
ber of risks associated with contamination and the health and safety of the animal the environment the workforce and the consumer continued

ty environmental and human resources at the forefront of business objectives contributes to its economic performance we work diligently to
minimize impacts such as outbreaks of avian influenza and other serious business events which can have devastating effects on all the poultry

environmental  electric gas and water
in the past eight 8 years we reduced our electrical usage by 35 gas usage by 25 and water usage by 28 per
processed pound surpassing our goals of 15 reduction each we are in the process of buildingremodeling anoth
er processing facility which should be up and running by the end of 2017 for 2017 our goal is to maintain our
usage of electric and gas we will strive to reduce our water usage another 10 per processed pound in 2018 we
will set new environmental reduction goals for both facilities for the next five 5 years

environmental  co2 and waste to landfill
in the past eight 8 years we reduced our landfill waste by 24 per processed pound surpassing our goal of 20 reduc
tion we did not meet our goal of 15 reduction per processed pound with co2 emissions since we use co2 for
stunning and have increased the amount of turkeys processed at the facility this has increased our usage of co2 along
with that we have more turkey meat to cool and use co2 dry ice to cool the product again increasing the amount of
co2 used we are in the process of buildingremodeling another processing facility which should be up and running by
the end of 2017 for 2017 our goal is to maintain our usage of co2 and waste to landfill in 2018 we will set new envi
ronmental reduction goals for both facilities for the next five 5 years
