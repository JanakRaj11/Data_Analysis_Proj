      our sustainability strategy  five longterm priorities
      we have identified five longterm priorities that will deliver shared value for our business society and the environment addressing
      such issues is intended to address the principle sustainability risks facing our operations and safeguard our continued capacity to
      do business




      l    prosperous retailers
           we are taking action to partner with current and potential tenants to make their businesses more resilient in particular
           enabling small local and sustainable businesses to thrive in circumstances in which they might not have done so otherwise

           experiences to customers consequently we can sustain our income streams and maintain innovation at the heart of sonae
           sierras business values

      l    resource resilience
           we are investigating ways to futureproof our assets by becoming energy independent and reusing water on our sites
           exploiting the latest innovations and technology in natural resource management to rethink processes this will protect our
           assets against natural resource shortages and cost increases and reduce operating costs in the short to medium term through
           alternative energy and water management strategies altogether this approach will enable us to reduce the detrimental
           impacts of our company on the environment and help us to maintain the essential services that nature provides

      l    leveraging knowledge
           we aim to empower our employees by building their skills and knowledge unleashing their potential on an individual basis
           and raising the standard of knowledge attainment at a collective level in the communities where we operate by doing so we
           can enhance the intellectual capital of our organisation and the external pool of talent from which we aim to attract ambitious
           people to join our workforce


      l    sustainable lifestyles
           we will use our reach and public influence to encourage visitors to make the right choices this involves promoting healthy
           green and local goods and services improving wellbeing through health activities in our shopping centres and creating a sense
           of place this approach enables us to increase visitors satisfaction and loyalty thereby increasing footfall in our shopping
           centres and adds to our brand value as we visibly support health wellbeing and environmentallyconscious behaviour


      l    safe people and ecoefficiency

      promoter of risk management best practices companywide the working group gathers information and reports on the risks that the
      company is facing or may face in the future and reports via the cfo to the audit and compliance committee

      guidelines for our third party services business covering risks related to human resources clients business knowledge and political
      instability and updated the existing crisis management manual with additional critical risk management aspects

      including the risk of being associated with an entity identified as potentially involved in money laundering terrorism or even sanctioned
      by international organisations in 2014 we updated our procedures manual for antimoney laundering combatting terrorist financing
      and sanctions compliance the manual establishes a defined set of procedures covering the provision of third party services partnerships
      and joint ventures investments and other related activities designed to mitigate the companys exposure to associated risks

      bringing liquidity to the market and increasing the consistency         position in all the markets we operate in

      2015 is likely to be a year of low but stable growth for italy and
      germany with gdp projected to increase by around 06 and
      15 respectively consequently private consumption is not
      expected to grow significantly in these markets nevertheless we
      expect to see tenant sales and rental growth in our portfolio in
      both markets and investor sentiment to remain on an upward
      trajectory opening up new opportunities to recycle capital and
      pursue development opportunities
      whilst brazil has now exited the technical recession it entered in
      the first half of 2014 the economy is still struggling and inflation
      remains high gdp growth for 2015 is expected to be marginal at
      around 07 and the country is likely to face a challenging year
      despite this the strength of our balance sheet means that we do
      not have major concerns about the coming period of economic
      uncertainty and we remain confident about our shopping centres
      operational performance as well as the medium to longterm
      prospects for this market

      profit  loss accounts
      sonae sierra recorded a net profit of 963 million in 2014 which compares with 36 million in the same period of 2013 the main
      difference results from higher indirect gains in 2014 as a consequence of yield compression in europe and the positive impact of
      operational cash flows in europe and brazil
      in 2014 direct net profit reached 527million which represents a 9 decrease versus last year the direct net profit is influenced by
      assets disposal in europe the adverse variation in the average exchange rate of the brazilian real and the strengthening of our
      corporate structure to support the companys growth in new geographies on a likeforlike portfolio basis and excluding the impact
      of adverse fx changes direct net profit increased by 56 as a consequence of the quality of our assets and management approach
      indirect net profit reached 436 million compared with a loss of 540 million in the same period of 2013 the positive variation in
      indirect net profit is a consequence of the yield compression in portugal and spain which accounts for 65 of the value created and
      the improvement in the operational performance of our european and brazilian assets despite the impairment reinforcement in greek
      projects in 2014 which is mainly explained by the expected nonrecovery of the greek economy in the medium term

      balance sheet
      the total assets of the company reached 23 billion of which 2 billion corresponds to investment properties and 63 million are
      properties under development
      the increase in investment properties compared with the 31 december 2013 is mainly explained by value increases in portugal spain
      and brazil and the acquisition of the additional stake in albufeirashopping and cc continente de portimão which were partially
      compensated by the disposals of la farga and the majority of our 50 stake in le terrazze while retaining 10
      the net worth as of the 31 december 2014 was higher than the same period of 2013 mainly as a result of the net profit in 2014 and
      the favourable fx change the yearend exchange rate was better than the same period in 2013 for the brazilian real
      bank loans decreased when compared with the 31 december 2013 mainly due to the disposals mentioned above and contractual loan
      amortisations

      sonae sierra brasil

      sonae sierra brazil contributed with a positive net profit of 262 million to the consolidated net profit of sonae sierra
      net operating income increased by 3 compared with last year which is mainly explained by higher income from mature assets and
      2013 openings excluding the adverse impact of fx changes in 2014 net operating income increased by 14 as a consequence of the
      quality of our assets and management approach
      lower financial result is a consequence of the noncapitalisation of interest upon 2013 openings and the consequent increase in financial
      costs please note that before opening the interest costs were capitalised as investment on properties under development
      although we recorded a positive indirect net profit in 2014 due to the impact from our operational performance it is lower compared
      with 2013 because last year properties value benefited from a yield compression in core shopping centres
      investment properties reached 423 million in december 2014 an increase of 32 million when compared with the 31 december 2013
      which is mainly explained by the increase in value of the operating assets and the brazilian real appreciation end of year rate

              closely to the value driven approach embedded in our sustainability strategy our business has the following positive impacts in relation to
              this aspect
               creation of financial value for suppliers and the local economy through development activity
               generating tenant sales through our property management activity

      g4ec2      financial implications and other risks and opportunities for the organisations activities due to climate change

      the impacts of climate change in the form of extreme weather events  flooding heat waves weathering subsidence etc could cause physical and
      local depreciation to assets and those with unreliable energy supplies could also depreciate faster than others on the other hand adapting existing
      buildings and developing and acquiring new buildings which perform better in predicted climate change scenarios could help to maintain and
      enhance asset and portfolio value in the long term
      in 2009 we commissioned a study to investigate the financial risks associated with climate change on a sample of our portuguese assets focusing
      on three components energy mainly electricity water and insurance costs this was done by identifying potential changes in energy use resulting
      from climate change under different scenarios and calculating the costs of these changes based on two main assumptions firstly that the price of
      electricity would be unchanged relative to what it was in 1990 and secondly that the price will change as a result of climaterelated policies in order
      to estimate the impact on the profitability of operations at the selected assets two approaches were taken the first was an accounting approach
      in which it was assumed that the cost structure would remain unaltered and reductions in profitability were calculated based on existing publicly
      available financial data for each shopping centre the second involved estimating the relationship between profitability and electricity prices using
      an econometric approach the econometric approach allows for the adjustment of operations in the centres to changing prices of inputs such as
      electricity and accounts for other indirect effects on profits such as increased visitors during periods of higher temperatures the results of this
      study revealed that
       the increased demand for energy and the anticipated increase in the price of energy is expected to reduce profitability by a maximum of between
        2 and 5 in 2030 and between 3 and 6 in 2050 with variations between different shopping centres
       in the case of water it was not possible to estimate the potential increase in demand due to climate change but the impact of increases in water
        costs was examined with the conclusion that these could reduce profitability by between 015 and 2
       the likely increase in insurance costs was estimated at 21 this could affect profitability between 01 and 07

      in portugal algarveshopping and norteshopping were selected for a more detailed assetlevel study the results of the study revealed that
       increased demand for energy due to higher temperatures combined with projected price increases are likely to impact on operational shopping
        centres profitability in the long term for example at norteshopping an estimated reduction of profits between 2 and 57 could occur in 2030
       water costs are also expected to rise but estimates vary significantly and the impact on profitability would be less significant for example
        between 005 and 014 at norteshopping and slightly more at algarveshopping due to higher water costs in this region
       insurance costs are likely to increase by around 21 due to the increased frequency of extreme weather events and other risks associated with
        climate change the impact on profitability is likely to be around 01 at norteshopping and 07 at algarveshopping
      in 2013 we commissioned a highlevel review building on the 2009 study to explore the business case for climate change adaptation it reviewed
      the following key business drivers as a consequence of climate change physical damage to property assets evidence of climate change risks
      affecting operational and asset value based on sonae sierra management acquisition and disposal activities evidence of climate change risks
      affecting insurance premiums and policy developments since 2010
      the findings highlighted that the strongest driver related to climate change adaptation relates to the possible transfer of risks usually absorbed
      by the public sector to the insurance industry or directly to the private sector other drivers include physical damage to sonae sierra assets from
      extreme weather related events conversely there was no evidence that climate change risks have had an impact on disposal activities for sonae
      sierra but there is increasing awareness amongst valuers at present there is a limited business case for adaptation measures based on legislative
      and policy drivers as there are no plans for introducing legally binding directives requiring property companies to adapt to climate change and it is
      unclear how the costs of planning for climate change adaptation at a national level will be absorbed
      at an operational level insurance premiums for sonae sierra assets are unlikely to be immediately affected however if insurance products were
      to become unavailable in the future due to an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events this would impose a significant
      burden on the state if this scenario were to happen then the private sector may need to absorb the costs directly and the risks to asset and
      operational value would substantially increase
      the potential impact of physical damage to sonae sierra assets is illustrated by the recent damage to four sonae sierra shopping centres in
      portugal madeirashopping in 2012 and brazil manauara shopping and uberlândia shopping in 2013 and boulevard londrina shopping in 2014
      as a result of weatherrelated events although the overall impact was limited in the most extreme case a shopping centre was forced to close for
      a short period and significant investment was required for fitouts to repair several shops
      in the context of this study sonae sierra has pursued a number of soft adaptation measures which do not require large levels of capital investment
      these include
       integrating climate change adaptation into the risk management process of our business activities through the risk management working group
       maintaining a register of relevant climate change adaptation policies in all countries of operation
       updating our acquisition checklist to ensure key risks related to weather related events are evaluated
       updating our building standards based on lessons learnt from weather damaged assets and to anticipate potential requirements for hard
        adaptation measures in the future
       monitoring of the impact of climate change risks on insurance premiums and asset values
      furthermore we will continue to review the relative materiality of other environmental impact areas in terms of the risk and opportunity they might
      present to the business as part of our risk management working group we use a standard risk management framework to evaluate environmental
      issues according to the likelihoodfrequency of occurrence and the scale of impact should they arise as well as energy and climate change other
      potential risks and opportunities include water and waste see pages 18 to 19 the issues identified are addressed through the resource resilience
      and safe people and ecoefficiency focus areas which form part of our sustainability strategy

              regional or local level
              this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2014 which was based on a number
              of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
              aspects and boundaries on pages 59 to 62
              during the development of our sustainability strategy we analysed the impacts of our business activities according to the five capitals
              model6 which enabled us to identify several indirect impacts that our company has on financial social and human capital stocks including
               job creation and skills development
               impacts on local businesses including suppliers from our activities
               impacts on our tenants businesses
              it is difficult for us to measure the significance of these indirect economic impacts in the context of external benchmarks and stakeholder
              priorities although feedback we have received from tenants and local community members has further highlighted to us the importance of
              these issues to some key stakeholder groups

              specifically we have developed several voluntary projects with reference to prosperous retailers which are designed to create economic
              benefits for local people in the locations where we operate shopping centres
              these include the coop store project that supports small businesses by exploring the idea of cooperative business models to reduce the
              operational costs for new startup businesses products and brands it is specifically targeted at entrepreneurs our 2015 target is to attain
              a 2 occupancy rate of vacant units with the coop store concept
              other initiatives that are currently in the pipeline include my 1st work experience that aims to support recent graduates in starting their own
              retail business by providing business planning project development and funding support and guidance we plan to launch the project in 2015
              and have set a goal to open one store in portugal based on the model

           results and adjustments
           by the end of 2014 we had five coop stores in operation at shopping centres in portugal and spain although we did not meet our target for
           an occupancy rate of 2 of vacant units due to the rollout being postponed in brazil and implementation difficulties in other european
           markets together the coop stores generated sales of more than 80000 for retailers taking part in the scheme who are all local
           independent businesses

       33 of shop units in our european shopping centres and 26 of units in our brazilian shopping centres are occupied by local businesses

               the development and operation of our shopping centres  as well as the delivery of our corporate activities  is dependent upon the

               and systems such as natural climate regulation and ecosystems services our activities in turn have adverse impacts on these resources
               through the production of greenhouse gas emissions waste and wastewater and in some cases through the urbanisation of previously
               undeveloped land

               in 2014 sonae sierra invested more than 133 million in environmental initiatives equivalent to 25 of direct net profit environmental aspects
               are clearly important to sonae sierra and to the companys stakeholders this is demonstrated through the materiality review performed by
               sonae sierra in 2014 which highlighted aspects such as water energy waste and emissions as the top four most material issues to sonae

           regular basis a series of tools and applications exist to assist the monitoring and reporting tasks such as the she portal and the cr portal
           performance results are reported on a timely basis to the sustainability steering committee executive committee and board of directors
           shems implementation results are evaluated annually as part of our management review process to ensure continuous improvement

           we have established an incident report and investigation procedure to report investigate communicate and act to prevent she incidents
           its main purpose is to implement corrective and preventive measures that are effective in avoiding similar situations that can lead to further
           accidents relevant importance is given to the communication of incidents their investigation the determination of their root cause the
           definition of proper corrective and preventive measures and also the communication of learning points throughout the organisation

           the majority of incidents recorded under this procedure cover safety and health incidents please see occupational health and safety
           pages 106 to 113 and customer health and safety pages 133 to 136 for more information on our performance in these areas

           we also have a nonconformities preventive and corrective actions procedure in place to

            identify and record actual and potential nonconformities

            implement correction measures to minimise their consequences

            analyse nonconformity causes

            define corrective or preventive actions and review their effectiveness

             the companys environmental accounting ea model details the current costs capital expenditure and economic and environmental
             benefits resulting from the implementation of companys safety health and environmental management system excluding sh issues
             the model allows sonae sierra to break down expenditures by legally mandatory socalled baseline expenditures and extrabaseline
             expenditures eg legionella monitoring in countries where no legal requirements exist in this way it is possible to estimate the economic
             effort of the company to strive to achieve more than just complying with legal requirements the ea is structured by environmental domain
             and specific activities and the presented figures include all shopping centres owned by sonae sierra in operation for the current reporting
             year except la farga in spain hofgarten solingen in germany boulevard londrina shopping and passeio das águas shopping in brazil

             capital expenditure and current costs are calculated from the companys financial controlling statements classifying them by assigning one
             or several environmental activities along with its related percentages and legally non mandatory fractions current costs include the human
             resource effort that is environmentally related and corporate environmental expenditure

             benefits can be physical or economic and are computed as differences in performance between 2014 and 2013 they are based on validated
             data also presented throughout this report economic benefits can be revenues monetary inflows from environmental conservation activities
             for example from waste recycling or savings avoided consumptions pollutants disposal or costs compared with the previous period

              significant actions are capital expenditure items corresponding to cost higher than 3500 for which environmental criteria were considered

              prior existing situations these actions produce effects throughout the assetequipments operating period the effects of actions from
              previous years and those for this period are shown in the table the implementation date of the significant actions for 2014 was on average
              31 october meaning that the benefits physical and economic for a full year are six times larger than the shown figures the benefits of
              significant actions from previous periods are likely to be underestimated since data started to be regularly reported in 2010 and data
              reported prior to 2011 was not exhaustively checked or validated nevertheless over the years the contribution of the unreported significant
              actions from the past will tend to decrease

              because the ea excludes legally mandatory expenditure the presented figures regarding capital expenditure and current costs differs from
              the table below detailing en31 expenditure benefits can eventually include items resulting from the compliance of legally mandatory
              requirements eg implemented actions from building energy certifications may impact the benefit reduction of electricity consumption
              on the other hand since benefits are computed from differences in centres performance from the last two years some current costs
              associated benefits may be excluded benefits of the period from previous years

      aspect      materials
      disclosures on management approach
      a   report the impacts that make this aspect material
           although the sourcing of materials used in shopping centre development and operations is controlled by our contractors we are aware that
           our business activity does entail a significant impact in terms of the extraction of raw materials including timber stone and metals
           principally through the use of semimanufactured goods and parts which are derived from raw materials whilst the extraction of raw
           materials adversely impacts on the natural environment the reuse of existing materials for example from demolition waste and the use of
           manufactured goods fabricated from recycled materials can help to promote a more sustainable closed loop approach to waste management
           and materials use

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2014 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
           aspects and boundaries on pages 59 to 62 above

      b   report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts

           policies and commitments
           we engage with our suppliers with the aim of encouraging them to adopt more responsible business practices our responsible procurement
           policy commits us to among other things privileging the use of materials which are locallysourced have recycled content have lowtoxic
           content have a long life and can be recycled or reused andor are sourced from companies which adhere to ethical andor environmental
           standards

           gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices to reduce and optimise raw material extraction purchased for
           direct use
           for sonae sierra it is difficult to control the selection of raw materials used in shopping centre development projects as our development
           contractors source materials generally premanufactured goods on our behalf this compromises our ability to gauge a clear understanding
           of the scale of our impacts in terms of raw material consumption nonetheless our safety health and environment development standards
           sheds prohibit the use of materials which are known to have negative impacts on the environment and on the health and wellbeing of
           building occupants and timber products derived from nonsustainable forestry during construction our shems ensures that efforts to
           reduce material use and waste are considered and whenever possible we reuse materials on site reducing the need for raw materials

           gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices for selecting materials and engaging suppliers including
           specifications for certifications or utilisation of preferred or prescribed lists of products and materials
           as noted above it is difficult for sonae sierra to control the selection of raw materials used in shopping centre development projects in 2012
           we conducted a study to quantify the recycled content of the most significant materials consumed during the construction of new projects
           including concrete brickwork steel glass and insulation the aim was to help us to identify which materials we might prioritise when seeking
           more sustainable alternatives the defined methodology is being applied to the construction of parklake in romania which is estimated to
           be completed in 2016

           according to the international energy agency iea the built environment is responsible for around 40 of the worlds total primary energy
           consumption and 24 of carbon dioxide co2 emissions in 2014 our shopping centres consumed a total of 13 million gj of energy and
           generated 30600 tonnes of co2e as governments proceed to mitigate the impacts of global climate change regulations on the energy
           consumption and ghg emissions of buildings are becoming more stringent consequently highenergy consuming and carbonemitting
           buildings are likely to become less attractive to investors and occupiers in the future on the contrary more ecoefficient lowcarbon assets
           which generate their own energy onsite from renewable sources are likely to sustain their value in the longterm

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2014 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material

           country regional or industry regulations and policies for energy

           policies and commitments
           we are committed to increasing the energy efficiency of our activities both within the scope of our safety health and environment she
           policy and management system procedures see page 47 to 49 above and our longterm priority of resource resilience see page 17

           goals and targets

           specifically we have a longterm objective to strive to increase the energy efficiency of our operations aiming to attain a maximum average
           electricity consumption of 400kwhm2 mall and toilet area per year across sonae sierra owned shopping centres by 2020

           responsibilities and resources
           responsibilities and resources for managing the energy aspect are covered by our safety health and environment management system

           gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices on energy management through
           all relevant stages of the life cycle
           energy efficient designs including energy performance targets and innovative engineering solutions are included in our safety health and
           environment development standards sheds within the sheds we specify the use of energy efficient boilers air conditioning units and
           other fit out equipment such as lighting and appliances we also require development managers to explore possible renewable and lowcarbon
           technologies during design such as passive solar design or natural ventilation

           we are especially committed to designing buildings that will achieve high energy efficiency ratings under the european unions energy
           performance of buildings directive since 2013 we have also aim for all our own new development projects major expansions and
           refurbishments where we have direct control to target as a minimum breeam good leed silver or dgnb bronze

           our construction contractors too can be big energy users during initial construction major refurbishments or expansions we make sure
           contractors strictly adhere to our shems which includes guidelines for monitoring energy consumption and achieving greater energy
           efficiency

           during the operations phase we ensure shopping centres are run as efficiently as possible see the disclosures on management approach
           for the environmental aspect overall on page 75 above during 2013 and 2014 we rolled out a new modelling tool bright project which
           enables us to calculate the optimised theoretical energy consumption of a shopping centre and then compare this with its actual usage
           making it possible to easily detect and remedy any inefficiencies the methodology allows us to adjust targets for each shopping centre
           which together with more reliable data should improve energy efficiency across our portfolio we also investigate opportunities for onsite
           generation of renewable energy and in 2013 procured green electricity through the grid to power shopping centres in portugal and spain

          country regional and industry regulations and policies for energy and emissions
          our organisation is subject to regional and national regulations and policies concerning energy and emissions at the regional level
          these include

           the european unions energy performance of buildings directive 200291ce and the 2010 recast of the same directive which
            mandates among other things that buildings undergoing major renovations must upgrade to meet minimum energy performance
            requirements that energy performance certificates epcs must be shared with prospective buyers and tenants of a building and that
            from 2020 or 2018 for public buildings all new buildings should be nearly zero energy

           european union regulation ec no 1005 of 16 september 2009 that starting from the 1 january 2010 replaces the regulation ec
            20372000 on the management of ozone depleting substances for general protection of stratospheric ozone this includes obligations
            for operators of refrigeration air conditioning or heat pump equipment and fire protection systems

            greenhouse gases

          at the national level these include

           building regulations in countries where we develop new shopping centres for example in germany all properties where a building permit
            was issued after the 1 october 2009 were required to meet the revised 2009 building regulations which demanded a 30 increase in
            energy efficiency of hvac and lighting systems and a 15 increase in thermal insulation compared to the 2007 regulations

           energy efficiency requirements for operational buildings in countries where we own and manage shopping centres for example in spain
            from 2010 the use of heating and cooling in new and existing nonresidential spaces was limited in accordance with a maximum
            temperature of 21c in winter and a minimum temperature of 26c in summer also in spain royal decree 2352013 sets out energy
            efficiency certification procedures for buildings

           legislation implemented at a national level in response to regional legislation for example in portugal decree nº 1182013 20 august
            on the system for energy certification transposes into national law directive 201031eu of the european parliament on the energy
            performance of commercial and residential buildings

      a   report the impacts that make this aspect material
           there is significant upward pressure on global fossil fuel reserves which is likely to increase the cost of energy over the longterm and
           contribute to growing volatility in global oil and gas markets in addition the ghg emissions generated by the burning of fossil fuels represent
           a significant environmental impact and they are coming under greater scrutiny as governments across the globe respond to pressure to
           reduce the potential impacts of global climate change in light of these trends sonae sierra has developed a longterm sustainability
           strategy which includes resource resilience as one of five focus areas resource resilience aims to implement measures to increase the self
           sufficiency of the company operations in relation to the use of natural resources

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2014 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material

      aspect      water
      disclosures on management approach
      a   report the impacts that make this aspect material
           as demand for fresh water becomes ever greater around the world due to population growth urbanisation increased economic activity and
           climate change we need to ensure we have adequate supplies for all our shopping centres particularly those in areas that are vulnerable to
           shortages such as portugal brazil greece and spain by improving the water efficiency of our portfolio and integrating systems for rainwater
           harvesting and water reuse on our sites we can reduce our exposure to water scarcity risks and minimise our water footprint which prepares
           us for potential future legislation and avoids costs

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2014 which was based on a number

           we are committed to increasing the water efficiency of our activities within the scope of our safety health and environment she policy
           and management system procedures see page 47 above and exploring ways to reuse water under our longterm priority of resource
           resilience see page 17

           goals and targets
           our strategy page 17 specifically we have a longterm objective to attain a level of water consumption at or below 3 litres per visit
           aggregated across all sonae sierra owned shopping centres by 2020

           gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices on water use management through all relevant stages of the
           life cycle  policy and practices on drainage and discharge of water
           we aim to ensure a secure water supply at all of our shopping centres with a particular focus on locations that are vulnerable to water
           shortages we use the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd global water tool to identify the areas in which we are
           developing new centres that are at risk of water stress or scarcity when these projects go forward the companys safety health and
           environment development standards sheds define that specific equipment like water chillers must be avoided in order to minimise our
           vulnerability to water shortages in areas with water use restrictions we also ensure that water efficient design including equipment
           specifications and water recycling engineering solutions is maximised

           where feasible we integrate rainwater harvesting and grey water recycling systems on new projects and refurbishments to reduce the need
           for freshwater or municipal water consumption during the fit out process we set requirements for water efficient sanitary equipment such
           as sensor spray taps waterless urinals and low flush toilets we have also developed a water calculator dive project to assess the water
           needs of every shopping centre taking into account its occupancy location and design it allows us to set consumption targets for the main
           water systems eg wcs irrigation which together with real time monitoring enables us to identify unusually high usage patterns and put
           in place tighter control mechanisms

           for shopping centres exterior areas and when landscape projects are defined we specify efficient irrigation systems and minimise the
           planting of species with high water demands for details of specific projects in 2014 to increase water efficiency and increase the reuse of
           water on our sites see operational performance pages 31 to 32

           stages of the lifecycle
           we incorporate solutions that reduce pollution to local water sources our shopping centres may have up to five different wastewater
           collection systems which enable different types of wastewater to be reused andor treated according to their characteristics wastewater
           discharges are analysed regularly by externally certified laboratories in order to control the contamination levels of our water discharges to
           municipal sewers streams etc

           during the design phase we are committed to incorporating solutions that reduce pollution to local water sources for instance to prevent
           pollution from rainwater runoff we specify filter drains and porous paving in external paved areas and stormwater management plans are
           implemented to contain or decrease stormwater runoff according to the sites characteristics additionally our sheds guarantee that
           equipment like grease and hydrocarbon separators or wastewater treatment plants are installed minimising pollution through the pre
           treatment of these effluents before they are discharged

           during construction works we also place demands upon our contractors to avoid the risk of water pollution from construction activities

           during the operations phase wastewater discharges are regularly analysed by externally certified laboratories and where there are no legally
           established monitoring requirements the following biochemical parameters are periodically analysed

           page 77 above

           results and adjustments
           in addition to gri indicators g4en8 g4en10 and cre2 below we monitor the water efficiency excluding tenants of our owned portfolio
           which in 2014 was 35 litres of water per visit a 5 decrease compared with 2013 see operational performance page 32




                        dive project allows us to calculate the optimised theoretical water consumption of a shopping centre and
                        then compare this with its actual usage against a hypothetical best practice model to identify inefficiencies
                        we can track the performance of a shopping centre against this model and set realistic consumption targets
                        an initial audit of 16 shopping centres identified annual savings of more than 192000 from improvement
                        measures that are expected to save 38000m3 of water

      a      report the impacts that make this aspect material
              sonae sierra shopping centres rely on some 1159 million m3 per year of water to deliver daytoday services such cleaning wc facilities and
              irrigation which is equivalent to the annual water consumption of 4637 people in portugal there is significant upward pressure on global
              water reserves which is likely to become more severe in the context of global climate change this could lead to an increase in water
              shortages leading to constraints on supply and emergency controls on the way in which water is used with some locations where sonae
              sierra operates being more directly and acutely affected than others in light of these trends sonae sierra has developed a longterm
              sustainability strategy which includes resource resilience as one of five focus areas resource resilience aims to use innovation and
              technology to rethink how water is used and managed at sonae sierra shopping centres

              this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2014 which was based on a number
              of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
              aspects and boundaries on pages 59 to 62 above

      b      report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts

              policies and commitments
              sonae sierra is committed to assessing the feasibility of installing technologies for harvesting and reusing water on site the purpose of this
              commitment is to reduce and eventually remove the need to procure water from third parties and to reduce pressure on aquifers

              goals and targets
              our resource resilience working group is actively identifying opportunities to improve water security and has proposed the rollout of water
              reuse systems as well as rainwater and phreatic water harvesting

              we have also set the following longterm objectives

               at least 10 of total water consumed at sonae sierra owned shopping centres to be reused grey water or harvested rainwater by 2020

               develop and implement a longterm strategy to ensure a secure water supply at our owned shopping centres with a particular focus on
                locations that are vulnerable to water shortages by 2020

      a   report the impacts that make this aspect material
           as noted under energy the built environment is responsible for around 24 of carbon dioxide co2 emissions as regulations relating to
           buildings energy consumption and greenhouse gas ghg emissions become more stringent it is likely that high carbon emitting buildings
           will be less desirable to investors and occupiers by reducing the energy consumption and ghg emissions associated with our shopping
           centres we aim to avoid costs and make our properties more attractive to future investors

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2014 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
           aspects and boundaries on pages 59 to 62 above

           regional or industry regulations and policies for emissions provide examples of such regulations and policies

           policies and commitments
           we are committed to reducing ghg emissions within the scope of our safety health and environment she policy and management
           system procedures see page 47 above we also endorse several external policiescharters which commit us to reducing our impact on
           climate change for further details see page 58 above

           goals and targets
           we have set longterm objectives to

            achieve an 85 reduction in ghg emissions per m2 of gla by 2020 compared to the 2005 level ghg protocol scopes 1 and 2 plus
             business air travel

            implement climate change adaption measures identified in our 2013 climate change study by 2020

           responsibilities and resources
           responsibilities and resources for managing the emissions aspect are covered by our safety health and environment management system
           shems see disclosures on management approach for the environmental aspect overall on page 76 above

           gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy on carbon management including policy position on carbon offsetting
           in 2006 we developed a climate change strategy to reduce our direct and indirect ghg emissions this covers scopes 1 2 and business air
           travel part of scope 3 according to the guidelines of the ghg protocol developed by the world resources institute wri and the world
           business council for sustainable development wbcsd

           our primary strategy to achieve this is through energy efficiency initiatives we have not established a policy with regards to carbon
           offsetting although we have compensated for carbon dioxide emissions in relation to some minor events it is part of our strategy to advocate
           more sustainable practices at an industry level and information on our advocacy positions can be found on pages 58 and 129 to 130

           aside from the energy used by our shopping centres themselves we also seek to reduce the energy consumption and ghg emissions
           generated by associated activities such as vehicle emissions produced by people visiting our shopping centres or by staff travelling to and
           from work or on business trips many of our centres are working to improve access by public transport and encourage its use by featuring
           public transport timetables and cycle storage facilities emissions are also produced by tenants occupying our centres and we advise and
           educate our tenants about saving energy and reducing ghg emissions from their activities

           in 2013 we performed a materiality assessment to review our most material scope 3 ghg emissions based on the corporate value chain
           scope 3 accounting and reporting standard published by wri and wbcsd by ranking all scope 3 emissions generate by our business
           activities according to their significance and the level of influence we have over them we can focus our reduction efforts where they are
           more relevant

      disclosures on management approach
      a   report the impacts that make this aspect material
           the construction and management of shopping centres can generate large volumes of waste that if not managed properly ends up in
           landfill landfilled waste is not only an inefficient use of resources the waste and the land it can generate damaging greenhouse gas
           emissions such as methane and carbon dioxide as well as pollutants that can leach into the soil and groundwater consequently disposal
           of waste in landfill is becoming more tightly regulated and more costly in most locations where we operate on the other hand good waste
           management can reduce environment impacts and be more cost effective for businesses as it avoids landfill tax and waste disposal costs
           a closedloop approach to waste management can also cut costs and environmental impacts associated with the consumption of raw materials

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2014 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
           aspects and boundaries on pages 59 to 62 above

           policies and commitments
           within the scope of our safety health and environment she policy and management system procedures we are committed to reducing
           the quantity of waste generated by our activities and to achieving high levels of waste recycling we are also committed to reducing our
           impacts in relation to wastewater production

           goals and targets
           we have set longterm objectives to

            ensure that all discharges to local water courses comply with sonae sierras wastewater quality standards and pollutant limits by 2020

            increase the proportion of total waste by weight that is recycled recovered or reused and obtain a minimum recycling rate of 65 across
             our sonae sierra owned shopping centres by 2020

            reduce the proportion of waste by weight that is sent to landfill below a maximum limit of 18 across sonae sierra owned shopping
             centres by 2020

            increase the proportion of total waste by weight that is recycled recovered or reused and obtain a minimum recycling rate of 90 across
             our main corporate offices by 2020

            maintain a high level of performance in terms of waste recycling in construction projects and aim to increase the proportion of construction
             materials with recycled content

           system shems see disclosures on management approach for the environmental aspect overall on page 76 above

           our site managers at each shopping centre projects under development and corporate offices are responsible for ensuring that waste is
           managed efficiently this includes providing appropriate storage areas and equipment that are well maintained preventing spillage and
           scattering during transportation and producing monthly reports of waste volumes we also provide staff with detailed instructions on waste
           codes rules for waste storage and final destination waste separation rules for nonhazardous waste and hazardous waste and waste

           gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices that promote waste avoidance as the first step in the waste hierarchy
           our sheds include a series of design requirements to maximise the waste separation potential of every shopping centre we develop so that
           once the shopping centre is in operation waste can be effectively sorted and sent for recycling and recovery a site specific waste strategy
           study is undertaken during construction to establish adequate provision of space for waste segregation bins and compactors temporary
           storage and internal preferential routes for disposal

           we take a progressive approach to waste management during construction works encouraging contractors to operate waste management
           plans aware of the difficulty that arises from the construction process being directly controlled by construction companies we are
           committed to gradually designingout waste produced during construction for example through offsite prefabrication during
           construction our shems ensures that the reduction of material use and waste is prioritised where possible we specify end of life recycling
           for building components which is particularly relevant for our refurbishment activities in addition construction companies are required to
           report back to us the results of their waste management

           during the operations phase we aim to progressively improve each shopping centres waste recycling rate the majority of waste handled by
           sonae sierra is largely generated by tenants activities aside from seeking to influence tenants practices there is little that we can do to
           reduce waste production in our centres all countries offer regular training for tenants on topics around waste avoidance segregation and

           are set out in our wastewater management procedure and include identifying all wastewater discharges into the municipal drainage systems
           andor wastewater systems and monitoring wastewater quality in accordance with the technical instruction for wastewater management
           we analyse the results and in any cases of nonconformity we produce a report setting out corrective actions

           wastewater discharges are analysed regularly by externally certified laboratories in order to control the contamination levels of our water
           discharges to municipal sewers streams etc see gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices on the management of water

           in addition to indicators g4en23 and g4en24 below we also record the total waste recycled as a proportion of waste produced and the
           proportion of waste that is sent to landfill across our owned portfolio see operational performance page 31




                        at cascaishopping in portugal we implemented a project to transform the internal waste management process
                        improve working conditions and make a positive contribution to community wellbeing through increased
                        recycling and waste optimisation the project has reduced waste management costs by 35 a saving of more

                        behaviour towards recycling initiatives such as tenant training and a remodelled waste area helped to
                        increase recycling rates by more than 200 since 2011 avoiding costs of 14000 and generating additional
                        income of 20000

              in 2014 our waste recycling rate in corporate offices increased by 4 meaning we met our longterm objective to achieve a recycling rate
              of 85 highlights include a significant increase in the recycling rate at our lisbon office compared to 2013 this was due to improved
              signposting for recycle bins during the second half of 2013 and the introduction of a number of measures to raise awareness of the
              environmental impacts of paper consumption next to office printers

              in our são paulo office paper consumption reduced by 36 following the replacement of a number of printers with a single machine that
              requires employees to sign in before using it the switch done in may demonstrates how encouraging employees to think before they print
              can lead to effective behaviour change and reduce our environmental footprint

           during the construction and operations phases we operate she management systems in all our construction sites and owned shopping
           centres which are based on iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 standards applying these standards enables us to guarantee that all she risks are
           identified and controlled it is also part of our policy to seek third party audit and certification of the she management systems across all our
           sites and we aim for all our new development projects major expansions and refurbishments where we have direct control to target as a
           minimum breeam good leed silver or dgnb bronze by doing so shopping centres ensure that their management systems are aligned
           with sonae sierras corporate policy and that she procedures have been fully implemented it also demonstrates to our stakeholders our

          from the preselection and bidding process through to contract closure and postcontract evaluation both our development and property
          management businesses have integrated the requirements of sonae sierras shems into their service suppliers management procedures so
          that these are set up in a way to ensure that our main suppliers performance meets with sonae sierras she requirements

          within the scope of these procedures all contracts with critical suppliers must include she clauses and subcontractors have the same level
          of she requirements as contractors if no formal contracts are signed then the service supplier must sign a warranty declaration to
          guarantee that she requirements will be met we have also established she regulations for service providers which include for example the
          obligation for suppliers to adopt protective measures to minimise risks that workers are exposed to compliance with these regulations is
          checked during work supervision and for longterm contracts including contractors from construction sites sh performance is evaluated
          during works execution

          all new shopping centre development projects must implement a sitespecific shems and achieve certification in accordance with the
          ohsas 18001 standard for the entire construction phase additionally a safety plan is drawn up for each of our construction sites and
          compliance with this plan is compulsory for all contractors contractors cannot begin any activity without the validation of this document by
          the sites sh coordinator and sonae sierras prior approval each of our development projects has a full time sh coordinator to validate
          contractors risk assessments and if necessary establish additional control measures the sh coordinators and outsourced project
          management teams carry out permanent sh supervision and planning on construction works identifying and correcting unsafe actions
          wherever necessary in respect to expansions and refurbishments a simplified shems is also implemented see page 49 for further details

          we investigate the cause of all incidents and communicate these across the company so that lessons can be learned to avoid a repeat
          occurrence this is done using alerts a communication tool that is also used during the construction phase we also hold regular she

          mandatory for all projects and is checked through a final audit carried out by a third party compliance with local sh regulations is also
          verified by competent authorities prior to opening as part of the licensing procedure for new shopping centres

          we also operate a corporate risk matrix that is used by centres to create a tailored risk matrix based on the sh risks to people during the
          operational phase this includes defined procedures for routine activities nonroutine activities such as fit outs and improvements to tenant
          units and emergency procedures for more information see indicator g4la6 page 113 and specific actions  programmes related to

          in 2013 we created a procedure to reduce risks for our staff travelling to countries where we are seeking to develop new business this
          ensures that all travellers receive an email on medical and security risks in the country they are going to visit we also increased the provision
          of travel insurance for employees and began training staff on precautionary procedures they should follow when travelling abroad for
          business purposes according to the countrys specific level of risk during 2014 we tested our procedures and worked with international sos

          during the new business phase of our own projects safety and heath due diligence studies are undertaken so that we can understand the
          potential safety and health liabilities that sites may contain such as materials and therefore guarantee sufficient budget in our investment
          plans to adequately deal with these issues

          during the design phase within our sheds there is a specific requirement which is included within the design team and contractors service
          agreements which prohibits the use of certain hazardous materials and substances as defined by sonae sierra throughout the
          construction works

          for the construction phase the use and disposal of hazardous materials is controlled by the implementation of our she procedures for
          development namely the shems for new projects the safety health and environment monitoring plan shemp  the simplified shems
          for major refurbishments and expansions and the small works procedure for minor interventions the onsite sh coordinators and
          development teams maintain a record of hazardous materials which come onto the site and are disposed of from the site

          during the operations phase and within corporate offices we have a procedure in place that sets out the main safety recommendations for
          handling hazardous products including the hazard characteristics of products the labelling rules storage incompatibilities and recommended
          protective measures these are supported by posters to raise awareness among service suppliers around the correct storage and handling of
          these products where possible we work with service suppliers to replace hazardous products with less hazardous alternatives that share
          similar characteristics

          specific actions  programmes related to assisting workforce members their families or community members
          regarding serious diseases
          we provide education and training counselling and prevention programmes for employees their families and community members regarding
          serious diseases or potential longterm damage to health these programmes cover commonly identified risks associated with sonae sierra
          activities see below as well as emerging health risks that could potentially affect our stakeholders for example in 2014 we organised a
          series of video and webbased awareness raising sessions on ebola for employees in europe and north africa the sessions incorporated
          advice from the international sos and the world health organisation and were attended by 47 employees

          sonae sierra has defined a transversal procedure in our shems aimed at identifying and evaluating sh hazards and risks to sonae sierras
          stakeholders the evaluation is made for all activities covering offices shopping centres in operation and development projects and through
          which we identify the potential consequences to people identifying both injuries eg cut burns etc and occupational diseases eg
          musculoskeletal disorders hearing loss etc

          as we evaluate a hazard we have to consider existing control measures and deficiencies the periodicityprobability of the hazards
          occurrence and its potential severity any nonacceptable risks that are identified must result in the implementation of additional risk control
          measures until the risk is classified as acceptable

          examples include

           in our shopping centres we identified that the inspection and testing of emergency generators could cause loss of hearing capacity to
            avoid this we implemented several controls such as short term worker exposure to noise regular noise measurements and communication
            of results and the mandatory use of suitable hearing protectors

           in our offices we identified the possibility of musculoskeletal disorders from handling air conditioning units for maintenance to avoid this
            we provide mechanical transportation equipment training on its use and regular inspections to ensure it is being used properly

          all matrices are validated by qualified technicians either the country safety health and environment coordinators in offices and operational
          centres or safety  health coordinators in development sites and then approved by the respective site manager additionally in all
          countries where this is demanded by law an occupational doctor also provides followup and feedback to sonae sierra employees in regular
          consultations and evaluates each employees workstation to avoid any future occupational disease

          regarding shopping centres under development we have acknowledged that the task of identifying the number of workers that are exposed
          to a specific risk at a specific moment is extremely complex due to site specific factors and that the time and effort required for this
          identification will not produce relevant benefits to sonae sierra we focus most of our efforts on ensuring that all existent risks in each
          construction site have proper control measures in place we have identified that workers on construction sites are more exposed to noise
          vibration dust and working with concrete knowing this and to minimise the associated risks measures including worker rotation awareness
          raising and the use of personal protective equipment have been implemented

      data qualifying note
      this indicator includes all sonae sierra direct employees supervised workers and independent contractors at the end of the reporting period the number of direct employees
      reported in this indicator differs from the total reported in g410 the reason for this is because shopping penha and tivoli shopping employees are not considered as direct
      employees in terms of human resources management but they are assumed to be in compliance with safety and health management system procedures and consequently
      are considered in this indicator

      a   report the impacts that make this aspect material
           companies where unfair treatment is present are at risk from lawsuits and fines for discrimination and are more likely to experience
           highlevels of staff turnover absence and poor team work on the contrary by applying the principles of equality and diversity and ensuring
           a meritocratic culture companies can attract a wider range of potential candidates increase levels of employee satisfaction retention and
           collaboration and prepare for emerging regulations concerning gender equality and nondiscrimination

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2014 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
           aspects and boundaries on pages 59 to 62

           policies and commitments including gri g4 cresd specific action  policy on gender equality including how gender is
           incorporated into procurement policy and plans
           we have a nondiscrimination and diversity policy that states our commitment to a meritocracy culture this is reinforced by our code of
           conduct which outlines our commitment to creating a workplace where each individual is treated fairly and where we recruit select train
           and remunerate based on merit experience and other professional criteria

           until now our company has not encountered barriers to gender equality in the workforce in the core countries where we operate however
           we acknowledge that this could become a more significant issue as we move into new markets such as north africa where the
           socioeconomic environment may inhibit equal opportunities in terms of education and by extension access to employment in sonae sierra
           brasil gender equality has not been an issue although the number of men in managerial positions is higher technical and management skills
           have been considered relevant to take these positions not gender and this has been acknowledged internally

           goals and targets
           as stated above sonae sierra has a commitment to a meritocracy culture although we do not set specific quantitative objectives or targets
           relating to this aspect

           responsibilities and resources
           responsibilities and resources for employment aspects including diversity and equal opportunity and equal remuneration are described
           under the disclosures on management approach for training and education on page 114

           gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policies and practices regarding gender equality in the workplace
           we have some policies in place which among other objectives can support diversity by promoting a more flexible workplace namely

            parttime working policy

            working from home policy

            flexible work schedule policy

           within the framework of these policies we have made particular efforts over the past couple of years to introduce more flexible work
           arrangements for employees whose job function enables them to take up these options

          supporting local charities to organising school and higher education visits

          specific actions  supporting local businesses
          we are committed to providing attractive shopping centres that serve the needs of the local population we seek to generate economic
          benefits for local communities by creating local employment inviting local businesses to rent space in our shopping centres and investing in
          initiatives that improve the wellbeing of local people in 2014 on average 33 of tenants across our european portfolio and 26 of tenants
          across our brazilian portfolio were local businesses as well as benefiting the community this strategy can also help us enhance our
          reputation and increase visitor numbers

          specific actions  community advisory panels
          we operate a community advisory panels caps programme to make sure that local communities are consulted on and involved in the
          development and operation of our shopping centres in a way that creates longterm relationships and is sensitive to local cultural
          considerations in order to select cap members we identify local stakeholder groups and invite them to participate based on the issues that
          are relevant to them our local shopping centre teams are empowered to develop actions in response to issues raised through the caps

           monitoring
           during the development stage we carry out feasibility studies to identify consumers needs in retail services and leisure activities in order to
           design shopping centres that match market needs and the existing retail offer these studies consider factors such as demographics within
           the catchment area and socioeconomic indicators

           in europe we carry out annual community geo tracking surveys to help us understand the impact of our shopping centres on local
           consumer habits these studies assess among other things the degree and quality of the existing commercial supply and the shopping
           facilities used by local residents information is collected through telephone interviews and structured questionnaires and results are used to
           define the centres marketing strategy to ensure that it is tailored to the catchment area

           our caps described on page 124 above also enable us to obtain useful feedback from local community representatives and in this way
           monitor and respond to our impacts on local communities

           results
           in 2014 cap meetings were held across 38 shopping centres it remains a challenge to maintain momentum among caps as not all local
           communities are keen to participate to address this we set an objective in europe for any cap that met once in 2013 to meet twice in 2014

      on 31 december 2014 sonae sierra owned 46 shopping centres and had seven projects under development including three for third parties and
      four new projects in the pipeline

      our community advisory panels caps which are described on page 124 above are in place across 38 83 of our operational shopping centres

      environmental impact studies eis or preliminary environmental evaluations pee are carried out on 100 of new development projects and on
      major expansions where we have direct control for example in the case of a joint venture they include specifications such as the identification of
      locations of historical architectural and archaeological value and data on important socioeconomic indicators within the study area when we begin
      new projects we perform a feasibility analysis which involves analysing the competition and impact of our activities on competitors performance

      our geo tracking studies evaluate the impact of our shopping centres on local consumer habits on an annual basis in 2014 geo tracking studies
      were performed at 32 70 of our shopping centres

      aside from these we do not have any local community impact assessment programmes in place across our portfolio we have community education
      projects in place at shopping metrópole in brazil but these are the only local community development projects in place across our portfolio

      however during the commercial licensing phase of new shopping centre projects we are obliged to comply with the planning obligations defined
      in each country and by each local authority for example in some locations we must set aside part of the site for the creation of green spaces and
      if this is not possible on the site in question we must pay a compensatory fee so that green spaces can be created in alternative areas the
      development of transport infrastructure around new shopping centre sites including roads bicycle paths and parking spaces footpaths etc is
      another example of infrastructure developed for community benefit in some instances to meet with mandatory requirements of local authorities
      and in others to meet with our own safety health and environment development standards eg regarding the promotion of sustainable travel
      many of our shopping centres also offer play areas for children crèche services sports and waste recycling facilities which are available for the local
      community for more information see the case studies on our website

           sonae sierra operates in several countries identified by transparency internationals corruption perceptions index as presenting a high risk
           of corruption given that sonae sierras operations in these countries are predominantly limited to the provision of third party services this
           aspect was not considered a material issue in the 2014 materiality review

           however given that sonae sierra is increasing its investment in new markets such as its recent development project in morocco corruption
           could pose a longterm risk for the company for this reason we have included anticorruption in our list of material issues and consider it
           prudent to take the necessary steps to manage the risk for sonae sierra and our stakeholders

           compliance with the avoidance of bribery and corruption is upheld by incorporating corruption risk into the annual internal audit plan of

           accept any reward or benefit with the purpose of influencing someones behaviour to obtain a commercial advantage

           companies of the funds whilst there are no specific guidelines to mitigate risks with respect to valuations the entity that carries out most
           valuations for sonae sierra indicates in its report that the fees collected from sonae sierra represent less than 5 of its revenue on a global
           basis within the context of our property management activities the procedure of getting bids for the services we contract out to suppliers
           minimises the risk of anticompetitive behaviour in the supply chain taking into consideration the strong involvement of several corporate
           organisational structures related to this process shopping centre management and central operation departments this procedure also
           ensures a clear coherent and accepted recommendation thus supporting the final award decision

           information see governance safety health and environment management system pages 47 to 49

           during the operations phase all sonae sierra shopping centres implement the procedures defined by our corporate safety health and
           environment management system shems with the aim of guaranteeing the safety of all building users we provide training on she issues
           and invite tenants to actively participate in open she committees during which sh issues are discussed and tenants are asked to actively
           participate in the shopping centres she management any issues identified by these procedures are followedup and corrective actions are
           taken we also raise awareness of safety and health risks through campaigns and awareness raising events such as posters and presentations

           within the scope of our shems we monitor tenants compliance with our she requirements for shopping centres by performing inspections
           on tenant units and followingup on any nonconformances detected we monitor and evaluate sh performance on a regular basis using
           tools such as she preventive observations spo emergency drills and she inspections covering safetyrelated equipment and
           installations in tenant units and technical areas spo are a form of process review carried out in our shopping centres and corporate offices
           to observe workers detect any instances of behaviours that present safety and health risks or environmental impacts and engage with the
           persons involved to make them more aware of she risks we also invite tenants to compete for our best tenant awards the personæ
           tenant award for best practice in sh and the planet sierra tenant award for best practice in environmental management each of these
           awards is presented biannually meaning that each year there is one competition focused either on environment or sh performance

           specific actions  addressing health and safety risks for visitors
           we regularly monitor visitor safety risks and organise awareness campaigns to promote safe behaviour in our shopping centres examples
           include safety and health days school visits and shopping centre tours the majority of incidents involving visitors include falls at the same
           level and escalator accidents in 2014 we conducted several studies in portugal and spain to identify the areas with the highest risks of slips
           as a result we are piloting a range of antislip measures prior to a broader rollout across our portfolio the findings were also presented to
           our architectural department for consideration in future developments

           if necessary we work with our suppliers to put in place preventive measures for example we developed a protective handrail in response
           to a number of accidents involving children on escalators at shopping centres not owned by sonae sierra the handrail was developed in
           cooperation with the escalator manufacturer and is due to be rolled out across our portfolio see case study below

      a   report the impacts that make this aspect material
           engagement with customers is vital for any business anticipating and responding to customers needs is essential to sustained revenue
           generation in the context of this aspect customers refer to shopping centre visitors please see tenant engagement and satisfaction for
           tenant surveys we engage with visitors in order to understand what drives their behaviour and purchasing decisions by responding to
           feedback from these visitors we can improve the quality of our shopping centres and promote more sustainable practices in retail and
           consumerism this is likely to result in higher footfall and sales as well as other benefits thereby supporting the longterm success of our
           tenants and our own businesses

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2014 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
           aspects and boundaries on pages 59 to 62 above

      b   report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts describe organisationwide practices in place to assess and
           maintain customer satisfaction these may include the frequency of measuring customer satisfaction standard requirements
           regarding methodologies of surveys mechanisms for customers to provide feedback

           policies and commitments
           we do not have specific policies or commitments concerning customer surveys mall tracking surveys see monitoring below are conducted
           regularly but their exact frequency is determined by individual shopping centre budgets other customer feedback tools include the
           customer contact management system which gives visitors an opportunity to provide feedback directly to our shopping centres complaints
           can also be presented to the sierra ombudsman see page 67

           goals and targets
           mall tracking surveys include a set of questions that relate to the customer experience although we do not set a target to achieve a
           minimum satisfaction level if visitors provide written feedback via the customer contact management system we have response targets as
           outlined in our service level agreement sla see below

           responsibilities and resources
           responsibility for visitor satisfaction and engagement lies with our shopping centre managers supported by the central marketing
           department see monitoring for details on visitor surveys and feedback mechanisms and how we respond

      c   report the evaluation of the management approach including
            the mechanisms for evaluating the effectiveness of the management approach

            the results of the evaluation of the management approach

            any related adjustments to the management approach

           monitoring
           we regularly undertake mall tracking surveys at our shopping centres to help us understand our visitors profiles their behaviour and
           requirements these surveys monitor trends in visitor satisfaction expectations loyalty and behaviour shopping centres develop action
           plans on the basis of the survey results paying particular attention to critical success factors affecting visitor numbers and shortterm
           actions necessary to correct any negative results we also conduct specific corporate responsibility surveys to better understand visitor
           attitudes towards sustainability and target our initiatives and communications accordingly see page 66 for more details

           we have a customer feedback system in place called customer contact management which provides a unique source of learning for our
           shopping centres we encourage visitors to submit their suggestions and complaints either verbally or in writing if verbal contacts cannot be
           resolved immediately we escalate them to written contacts and request that customers submit their feedback in writing or we submit the
           feedback on their behalf via a form we ensure that the shopping centre manager personally responds to all suggestions and complaints
           received

           when visitors offer their time to provide written feedback it is essential to show that we take their views seriously the first step is to ensure
           an adequate answer in a short period of time this timing is measured against the sla the objective is to respond to customers in three
           working days but acknowledging that this is not always feasible the sla target is 70 answered in three days 95 in one week and 100
           in two weeks during 2014 we received approximately 1900 written contacts of which 93 were responded to in three days and 100
           within two weeks
