annual review 2014                           alma media corporation

an interview with the president and ceo
in your opinion how did alma media succeed in 2014
the year was characterised by two different forces firstly as the economy in finland continued to be weak the
development of finnish printed media business was poor good digital growth did not fully compensate for the decline
in printed media secondly our business outside finland grew better than expected and its profitability remained
excellent

due to the economic recession and weakened macroeconomic forecasts in 2014 we sought cost savings by streamlining
our operations processes and organisation the streamlining efforts and good digital development efficiently dampened
the negative effect of the weak operating environment and declining demand on our performance



to what extent did alma media achieve its financial targets in
2014
our longterm financial target of 15 per cent return on equity was not achieved in the prevailing market conditions
however our digital business grew 12 per cent which is rather satisfactory last year digital products and services
accounted for 32 per cent of group revenue



in your opinion what were alma medias most important
development steps in 2014
we continued to develop and increase our international recruitment business by merging alma medias recruitment
operations in different countries under one company alma career started operations at the beginning of 2014 the
company which we own jointly with monster worldwide inc expanded our digital recruitment business into countries
in which we were not present before namely hungary and poland

i am particularly glad that the strong growth of alma medias digital business continued in 2014 in the third quarter
our digital advertising sales exceeded printed media advertising sales in the whole year 2014 advertising sales from
digital and printed media were on par

in publishing operations one of the highlights of the year was the establishment of lännen media in my opinion the
agreement signed by alma media and five other finnish newspaper publishers on journalistic collaboration and the
establishment of lännen media oy is a significant step towards ensuring the quality of regional publishing operations
and the costefficiency of business the collaboration has resulted in the regional papers benefiting from a significant
amount of new content to be utilised in both the print newspaper and paid online services



how has the operating environment changed during the year
unfortunately the general economic situation has not improved in finland and the rest of europe in 2014 consumer
demand was weak due to consumers declining purchasing power this had a particularly strong impact on the sales
and marketing investments of retail and specialty trade both important for newspaper advertising sales

as consumers patterns of media use are increasingly characterised by digitisation advertisers are at an accelerating
rate investing in online stores and digital marketing channels digitisation has led to globalisation of the market and we
are now facing a new type of competitive situation we have to compete for the attention of finnish consumers with the
largest american players in the media field such as google and facebook

however alma media is well established in the new competitive field and the company has the resources for continued
success




annual review 2014                                          1                                    alma media corporation

many media companies invest heavily in the it development for
purposes such as more efficient use of consumer data in business
can this development be seen in alma media
media companies are increasingly developing their business towards the it industry and technical development plays a
strong role in our daily work the use of socalled intelligent data will be one of our most important areas of
development in the next few years we build consumer data by analysing our content and our services for advertisers
and we develop our advertising and content sales

systems for data analysis and the use of data are already in daily use at editorial offices minute by minute we analyse
consumers moves in online services and modify the content to serve consumers in the best possible way our media
sales also use technology developed for the analysis and management of advertising with these tools we can target
advertising in accordance with customers needs at the same time of course we keep consumers privacy protection
strictly in mind



what were the key issues in 2014 in terms of corporate
responsibility
last year alma media continued its own activities and cooperation to mitigate the environmental impacts of the
media sector develop the competence of its employees and reduce youth unemployment corporate responsibility
activities particularly highlighted the effects of journalism on society responsible management of consumer data and
the local social responsibility of journalism

recently the role of freedom of speech in society has become a strongly debated issue in finland and around the world
after the terrorist attack on the french weekly the attempt to suppress freedom of speech with violence and terrorist
activity has been widely condemned around the world

at the same time in finland we also have to consider the existence and working conditions of a pluralistic and free
press from a wider perspective the general instability of the economy has challenged finnish media companies and
will at worst deplete our diverse media landscape without a functional wideranging pluralistic highquality media
democracy cannot exist alma media wants to prevent such development by improving our media to respond to
consumers needs even betterwithout compromising the quality of the content in addition responsible collection use
and storage of consumer data is always essentially important for alma medias business



what are alma medias sources of growth in 2015 and in the near
future
in the next few years the majority of growth in alma media will come from digital mediathrough existing brands and
new products and services both in finland and internationally in addition to digital service business in the near future
we will develop our delivery and printing services we will invest in information services and various consumer and
lifestyle services and we will continue to increase our international recruitment business our balance sheet position
has improved according to plan this makes it possible for us to make use of suitable investment opportunities when
the time comes

the operating environment will continue to be very challenging alma media must be alert in reading weak signals and
adapt its operations accordingly in a time of transformational changes in the media industry alma media is supported
by a strong strategy and a clear direction towards a digital future all of alma medias business units will continue to
focus their resources on digital business and invest strongly in developing their digital expertise

i want to thank our customers employees investors and partners for the past year alma media is in a good position to
develop its operations and serve its stakeholders even better also in the future




annual review 2014                                          2                                    alma media corporation

operating environment
for media companies 2014 was a difficult year the reasons for this were in particular the weak
economic situation in europe and finland and the accelerating changes in media consumption
habits advertising decreased and media consumption shifted to digital channels  especially to
mobile media
uncertainty in the global economy continued and the finnish economy remained in a downward economic cycle in
2014 the weakness of the eurozone and the deterioration of the economic situation in russia due to the ukrainian
crisis had an impact on finland in the form of lower exports and decreased domestic demand the productivity and
competitiveness of the finnish economy has diminished and there are no clear signs of a turn for the better

according to economic forecasts finnish gdp growth for the full year 2014 is estimated to be negative negative growth
has now continued for three years both consumers and businesses confidence in the economy was weak through the
whole year

the economies of eastern central europe have developed favorably and the gdp growth in alma medias main market
areas there has supported the companys recruitment business according to economic forecasts the gdp is estimated
to grow 25 percent in the czech republic and 24 percent in slovakia in 2014 european economic forecast 1114



media advertising volume continued to decline
media advertising volume which is closely linked to gdp growth decreased in finland in 2014 according to tns media
intelligence by 35 percent compared to the previous year totalling meur 11758 the media advertising share of gdp
was at a historical low

consumers are shifting to mobile
the media industry is inevitably moving towards digitality due to a change in consumer habits media consumption is
becoming increasingly fragmented between different media and the use of time and the diversity of devices is
increasing as supply grows for media companies this calls for building an aroundtheclock media consumption
experience and comprehensively analysing customer preferences and media use content must be flexibly created for
different devices and the consumer must be followed from screen to screen

the operating environment of finnish media companies in 2014 was affected by customers increasingly shifting to the
internet and mobile content in particular according to an international study conducted last year online media is now
the number one source of news for finns even exceeding tv news in reach the same study reveals that one out of five
finns now reads the news primarily on their smartphones the same trend can be seen in alma medias services with
an increase in mobile traffic of 109 percent over the past 18 months

moving forward towards digitality
for regional media 2014 was characterised by efforts to improve efficiency and strengthen digitality in both working
methods and services

several developments were made to serve advertisers and consumers as they shift to digital channels alma regional
media recruited the units first director of digital business in the third quarter late in the year the segment also
launched a special project to increase its digital competence the development project covers alma regional media in
its entirety and is aimed at increasing digitality in business personnel have a central role in this effort as they are
challenged to take part in the planning of digital business the needs of active media consumers are the basis for the
development of renewed business models operating culture and expertise the project will last for approximately 18
months and it has received funding from the liideri programme of tekes  the finnish funding agency for innovation

the segments response to the digital transformation and changing consumer behaviour also included the development
of multichannel content aamulehti began a project for launching hetki moment a new paid digital afternoon
edition the new digital edition was released in january 2015 hetki complements aamulehtis digital product offering
by adding a new consumer product for the afternoon the time of day when the news stories covered in the morning
paper are due for an update alma regional medias other regional and local papers also continued to develop their
paid online services for example pohjolan sanomat and aamulehti implemented a partial paywall at the beginning of
2014 and kainuun sanomat followed suit in march 2014 alma regional medias video production took significant
leaps forward by organising video training and harmonising video platforms across the segments various papers

renewal also continued on the print side for example in the form of aamulehtis switch from broadsheet to tabloid
format the tabloid renewal involved changes in the newspapers content structure supplements and design the
renewal was carried out with extensive input from readers and feedback was also collected after the renewed
aamulehti was launched the first tabloidformat aamulehti was published on 1 april 2014 alma regional medias
other regional papers had already previously adopted the tabloid format

to improve the profitability of regional publishing operations and ensure the quality of content alma media and five
other finnish newspaper publishers established lännen media the newly established company improves journalistic
cooperation between newspapers in western and northern finland and enables shared content production for printed
papers as well as the digital online and mobile channels the founding newspapers of lännen media include the alma
media newspapers aamulehti tampere satakunnan kansa pori lapin kansa rovaniemi kainuun sanomat
kajaani and pohjolan sanomat kemi the ilkkayhtymä newspapers ilkka seinäjoki and pohjalainen vaasa
hämeen sanomat hämeenlinna and its affiliate forssan lehti forssa turun sanomat turku kaleva oulu and
keskipohjanmaa kokkola

the printing and distribution company alma manu oy which was previously reported under the other operations
segment became part of the regional media segment in march 2014 the purpose of this rearrangement is to increase
collaboration between manu and its largest customer alma regional media as well as to improve the use of resources

there were many changes in alma manus distribution operations during the year itella nowadays posti discontinued
many of its early morning delivery agreements across finland which led to the early morning delivery of newspapers
being transferred to new service providers distribution in a small area in tornio was transferred to alma manu in the
summer already before that alma manu had handled the early morning delivery of some newspapers including
aamulehti pohjolan sanomat and lapin kansa in order to improve the profitability of distribution operations and to
maintain its service level alma manu applied for and received a postal licence from the finnish government for letter
deliveries in pirkanmaa and satakunta the licence authorises alma manu oy to provide postal services to contract
customers in the geographic area covered by the licence alma manu also reorganised its distribution and transport
network in the third quarter and joined forces with the major finnish newspaper publishers in the fourth quarter in
october 2014 alma media started to investigate together with sanoma media finland keskisuomalainen oyj ts
yhtymä kaleva oy mediatalo esa and länsisavo group the possibility of establishing a joint venture with the aim of
developing the cooperation between early morning delivery service providers and their logistics as well as to manage
the nationwide sales of delivery services the aim is to create a system for the early morning delivery network of
newspaper publishers so it could take on more material to deliver and to ensure highquality and costefficient
operations

due to weakerthanexpected performance regional media reached an agreement in the second quarter on savings in
annual personnel costs of approximately meur 15 for 2014 the savings were achieved by temporary layoffs and by
exchanging bonus holiday pay for days off

promotion of equality and nondiscrimination
alma medias unitspecific equality plans include practical and detailed objectives actions schedules responsible
persons and metrics equality plans are part of human resource and training planning and they are updated annually

although the differences in salaries between men and women at alma media have been in line with the average
finnish pay structure improving gender equality in pay has been highlighted as an important area of monitoring and
development for the group this development has been successful in almost all employee groups partly by allocating
companyspecific portions of salary increases in a manner that promotes gender equality in pay

in 2014 due to the general economic situation companyspecific portions could not be allocated however thus
equality in pay could not be promoted in this way in 2015 close attention will be paid to the development of equality in
pay and alma media will strive to improve it further

brainprint and communities
it is essential for a responsible media company to observe how the content it produces affects society
and to bear responsibility for those effects
at alma media such responsible content production is called brainprint the term was launched by the wwf in 2005
in recent years alma media has worked to introduce the finnish equivalent of the term ajatusjälki in the finnish
language and in the debate on the responsibility of the media industry

therefore in june 2014 for the second consecutive year alma media participated in the mirrors or movers seminar
held in london the main themes of the seminar were questions related to measuring the brainprint of media equality
issues and the way women are portrayed in media medias ability to influence peoples environmental attitudes and the
data security of users of media content



alma media as a responsible influencer in society
taking the brainprint of media into account in content production and journalism each day constitutes an important
part of alma medias responsible business one way to evaluate the success of alma medias papers in this is to
monitore changes in the number of council for mass media cmm decisions concerning alma media council for
mass media cmm decisions reader feedback reader panels and requests for corrections are all metrics for reliability
and responsible journalism

alma media papers discuss cmm decisions at newspaper level led by the editorinchief and develop their operations
accordingly

in 2014 the council for mass media issued a total of 96 decisions on matters such as corrections and surreptitious
advertising of these decisions 17 pertained to alma medias various media of the decisions pertaining to alma media
35 per cent were condemnatory which was a lower percentage than the overall rate of condemnatory cmm decisions in
2014 the overall rate for condemnatory decisionsby the council last year was 40 per cent

after the peak experienced in 2013 however the total number of cmm decisions in finland dropped in 2014 closer to
the level of the previous years however the number of cases dealt with by the cmm remained higher than in the first
years of the 2010s

driver of change at the grassroot level
as a strong regional and local finnish media company alma media also has the unique opportunity to participate in
many local grass rootlevel projects that implement alma medias objectives of responsible journalism and social
development and highlight regionally important themes

in 2014 a few of these larger projects were the tampere car boot fair arranged twice a year jointly by aamulehtis moro
supplement and the local parish and broad regional campaigns by kainuun sanomat and pohjolan sanomat aiming to
increase the vitality of their respective regions both the kannata kainuuta support kainuu campaign launched by
kainuun sanomat in summer 2014 and the merilappilainen jalanjälki footprint of sea lapland campaign lauched
soon thereafter were designed and carried out in cooperation with local entrepreneurs and other actors their
objective is to help locals to understand that they can influence the employment rate and availability of services in their
region through very small changes to their consuming habits by buying just a little more local products and services
both newspapers have a visible role in the projects having developed an entire product and event family around the
campaigns the campaigns continue and expand in both regions at least throughout 2015 in kainuu the local centre
for economic development transport and the environment joined the campaign at the beginning of 2015 yle
perämeri a local radio station of the finnish broadcasting company is involved in the collaboration in the kemi and
tornio region

another example of social projects is the popular car boot fair in tampere which promotes recycling the event also
supports local charity work the pitch fees and income from the boot fair café are all directed to the soup kitchen that is
run by the parishes of tampere each year the car boot fair produces approximately eur 25000 for the soup kitchen in
addition external partners are often involved in the boot fair project and additional aid projects are carried out with
them in the car boot sale arranged in spring 2014 a partner to the project was a company specialising in efficient
recycling with this partner we carried out a campaign for the collection of used spectacles and sunglasses a total of
10000 pairs of spectacles and 2000 pairs of sunglasses were collected during the car boot fair the glasses were then
delivered to tanzania by an international eye specialists humanitarian organisation



alma media and the future stars
in addition to the direct and indirect impacts of its business operations alma media supports economically and socially
sustainable development through partnerships one example of this is the youth employment permanent and summer
jobs campaign organised in partnership with the finnish children and youth foundation fcyf carried out for the
fourth time in 2014 the responsible summer job 2014 campaign challenged companies to create good summer jobs
for young people the goal of the campaign is to take an actionoriented approach to youth employment in 2014 a total
of 161 employers joined the campaign to offer over 33000 responsible summer jobs the campaign continues in 2015
now with the finnish economic information office tat at the helm instead of the fcyf the objective is to have more
employers participate

for the second consecutive year aamulehti is involved in systematic cooperation with the pirkanmaa me  mycity a
miniature enterprise that carries the name of the partner will be designed and built in the me  mycity learning
environment each day three to five sixth graders work there in jobs that simulate reallife professions each school
year a total of 5000 sixth graders have visited the pirkanmaa me my city to learn about the business and operations
of the partner they are future employees consumers and citizens

environment
in spring 2012 the global reporting initiative gri published a media sector supplement as
guidance for the media industry in 2013 alma media was the first finnish media company to start
publishing an annual corporate responsibility report in compliance with the gri media sector
supplement guidelines
alma medias environmental study completed in 2013 and conducted in cooperation with vtt technical research
centre in finland and the swedish center for sustainable communications has played an important role in the
development of alma medias environmental responsibility the environmental study focused on the effects of printed
and digital media

in 2014 alma media continued its participation in the carbon disclosure project cdp a global initiative on climate
impacts and was ranked as the top nordic media company alma media has been a signatory of the un global compact
initiative since 2011



environmental responsibility is the strength of new buildings
the most significant environmental impacts of the operations of alma media and its business units are related to
printing and distribution buildings purchasing and travel alma medias new helsinki office in töölönlahti completed
in december 2012 and the new printing facility in tampere that started production in spring 2013 reduce the highest
direct environmental impacts environmental impacts during construction and use were minimised in both projects
both of the buildings received leed environmental certification in 2013 the töölönlahti office building achieved leed
gold certification in recognition of excellent consideration of environmental matters as far as is known the tampere
printing facility is the worlds first leedcertified printing facility

during the design process of the töölönlahti building including the choice of location environmental aspects were
taken into account as follows

      energyefficient building technology
      underground parking with charging stations for electric cars
      waste management during construction and use with extensive recycling
      excellent public transport links



focus on material and energy efficiency in printing
alma media develops its environmental responsibility by improving its material and energy efficiency the
environmental study carried out in 2012 provided information on potential opportunities for improving efficiency the
new printing facility and office building significantly improve the energy efficiency of alma medias properties for
instance the printing facility in tampere has a heat recovery system that captures over 80 per cent of exhaust air the
production efficiency of the new printing press is higher than before and the use of solventbased detergents and water
has decreased

the amount of materials wasted has considerably decreased in the new printing facility the amount of maculature
decreased by 11 per cent compared with the previous year in 2013 the first year of the new printing facility the
maculature percentage did not decrease as test runs and problems in the breakingin phase produced more waste
material than normal

another key aspect of material efficiency is the recovery of waste almost all waste created by the printing facility is
used as a raw material by other businesses in 2014 all waste generated at the printing facility was recovered for
recycling or reuse and no waste ended up at landfill sites

harmful voc emissions volatile organic compounds from printing operations were kept very low in 2014 however
emissions increased slightly from the previous year amounting to 4488 kg in 2014 in 2013 4200 kg the slight
growth resulted from more detailed reporting by raw material producers relating to potential raw material component
residues the chemicals used for cleaning the printing machine have been vocfree for some time and since 2012 the
company has also minimised the voc content of the dampening solution used in the printing process alma medias
printing facility in tampere was one of the first printing facilities internationally to begin using a dampening solution
that is almost entirely free of voc emissions

the maculature percentage expresses the proportion of waste material to total material used in printing operations


development of environmentally sustainable operating methods
and purchasing
alma media can influence its environmental impact through its purchasing policy in particular environmental
considerations are now particularly taken into account in newsprint purchases paper manufacture has wideranging
impacts on climate change and resource depletion as well as biodiversity in 2014 75 per cent of the newsprint used by
alma media contained recycled fibre the share of recycled fibre in all newsprint pulp used by alma media was 38 per
cent environmental issues are also a key factor in purchasing chemicals and printing plates

in addition alma media can efficiently decrease its ecological footprint by changing its own operating methods over
the past five years the company has implemented new videoconference systems and other tools to facilitate remote
work this has reduced travelling and consequently the environmental footprint

alma media units had a total of 23 installed videoconference systems in 2014 furthermore the lync communication
tool was frequently used for alma medias internal video conferences and telephone conferences according to statistics
600 internal meetings were arranged last year using the videoconference system or lync which equate to
approximately 7000 hours of meetings during the year the actual figure was considerably higher because not all
meetings were included in the statistics such as smaller lync meetings with only two participants

in recent years alma media has also significantly reduced the number of pages printed this too resulted from
changed operating methods the number of printing devices in the different units was reduced from slightly under 500
printers to 140 devices currently at the same time alma media employees have increasingly switched to documents
provided in digital format only therefore the number of pages printed has decreased by 40 per cent to 32 million
pages per year currently

the sustainable media corporate responsibility programme aims to increasingly integrate ecological considerations
into ict purchases the environmental study indicated that ict equipment and infrastructure have significant
environmental impacts careful analysis and mitigation of these impacts is of great importance as digital media
consumption increases

the average carbon dioxide emissions of the groups leased car fleet are also monitored on a regular basis the target is
to reduce average emissions by eight per cent from 2013 to 2016 in 2014 the average co2 emissions of the groups
motor vehicles were 135g of co2 equivalent per kilometre 2013 141g



increased awareness through open communication about
environmental responsibility
in 2014 the ratkaisun paikka the leading cr event in finland corporate responsibility event was arranged for the
third time with alma media as the main media partner alma medias role in the event was to provide greater
exposure arrange presenters and deliver a talk the objective of alma medias participation in the event was to promote
corporate responsibility thinking in finland this goal was reached the event with some 700 visitors and highly
positive feedback exceeded all expectations

alma media is actively involved in industrywide environmental initiatives such as the shape study of the federation
of the finnish media industry and vtt technical research centre which investigates media consumption from the

alma medias advertisers are increasingly interested in how alma media supports their sustainable development
measures or messages through its own responsibility alma media has taken an active approach to responsibility in
advertising in 2013 it collaborated with an international media company to study the environmental effects of the
advertising value chain as a whole particular focus was placed on new ways of integrating corporate responsibility into
media sales in 2014 this theme was developed further in internal dialogue within alma media the work continues in

new business journalism in itself already supports this objective but there are also interesting perspectives in the
context of the development of digital services the sustainable media perspective is also part of the monitoring of the
operating environment which is a key aspect of research and development

a glance at 2015
in 2015 alma media will continue on the path outlined by its four strategic themes and continue to
grow its digital business further the improvement in the companys financial position in 2014 opens
up opportunities for expediting growth through targeted acquisitions
since 2008 alma media has implemented a significant structural transformation that has led to the digital business
growing to account for a third of revenue at the same time the company has become more international by acquiring
recruitment businesses in eastern central europe the profitability of the new businesses is at an excellent level at the
same time the domestic operating environment is likely to remain difficult



market outlook
in the turn of the year 20142015 there are hardly any signs of the economy turning to sustainable growth even in the
long term in alma medias main market finland the longterm outlook is weakened by structural problems in the
economy and a decline in productivity

the predicted extended period of slow growth is likely to affect consumer demand and investments in marketing
communications in finland

in eastern central european countries economic growth is expected to continue in the coming years brisk economic
activity supports the growth and profitability of the recruitment business

digitisation has resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of content and services available to consumers while
also permanently changing consumers media behaviour the fragmentation of media consumption is continuing with
regard to media services the use of time and devices competition for content and service provision is growing and
loyalty to media brands is diminishing

the rapid growth in the use of smartphones and tablets will continue promoting growth in the mobile consumption of
media content online video consumption will continue to see strong growth

the consumer threshold for paying for digital content will remain high paid services must provide clear added value to
the consumer compared to free and advertisingfunded content

in marketing new forms of advertising such as content marketing and native advertising are growing in significance
by complementing the services provided to consumers in the digital advertising market strong growth trends include
the development of programmatic buying and selfservice solutions as well as mobile and video advertising the role of
behavioural data and analytics in business development will grow with regard to both content and advertising



strategic themes
in 2015 alma media will continue to implement its strategy under four themes  while following our values
