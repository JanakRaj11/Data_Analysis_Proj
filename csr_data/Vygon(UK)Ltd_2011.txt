                                                                                                                    ceo of vygon sa

statement from the managing director of vygon uk ltd
it is no coincidence that despite not being formally involved in sustainability until now the vygon group is able to
produce a statement from the president containing so much relevance to sustainability and in particular to issues
raised by our stakeholders dating back to the principles set by mr simonet on founding the organisation in the 1960s
vygon has always sought to provide what the customer wants whether it be product or a degree of support we
have also worked closely with other members of the supply chain in order to achieve the desired results in product
sourcing distribution and home delivery

engaging the stakeholder has enabled us to focus on specific areas which
we can as a responsible supplier of sensitive products to the uk
healthcare market incorporate in to our strategies and policies
for example while waste packaging health and safety of
staff and customers using our product and sound
economic growth have always been high on the
agenda we now find ourselves taking greater
responsibility for the product throughout its
life cycle and considering such factors as
child labour and enforced labour and even
the looking at the estimated 303kg of plastic
cups we use in a year

there is still much work to do vygon
has offered significant commitment in
starting the project we must ensure from
the management level down that it is
incorporated appropriately in to all future
thinking

origins of environmental sustainability at vygon sa                                 en iso 140012004  section 42
in 2001 vygon sa defined an environmental policy reflecting concerns of the         environmental policy
company towards sustainable development in this adoption of iso 14001
was made a priority realising it began a longterm commitment to a continued
                                                                                    top management shall define the
process of environmental and sustainable improvement within the group

the adoption of iso 14001 was centred on five key criteria all fully endorsed by   ensure that within the defined scope of its
the groups most senior management
                                                                                    environmental management system it
   organisation of an efficient monitoring of regulatory matters                   is appropriate to the nature scale and
   reduction of the industrial impact on the environment and risk of pollution

   improvement of waste management
   awareness training for personnel in environmental protection                    products and services
   increase in the dialogue between vygon and stakeholders with particular
    reference to the local community

vygon sa has achieved iso 14001 qualification for the main group
manufacturing site in ecouen france as well as for the central sterilisation
stores and distribution unit in verneuil en halatte france

examination of issues raised by vygon uk ltd primary stakeholders in
particular the customer show a particularly close correlation to stated company
objectives profitable growth through the supply of high quality products and
a high level of customer support and service attention to these goals has led
vygon sa to a position where sustainability issues have been addressed or are
already being addressed

researching the subject of sustainability reveals that the greater majority of
active companies and annual reports on the subject originate from large
multinational companies while the vygon group is multinational it can not
be compared in size to many of the sustainability pioneers vygon sa must
be selective in the allocation of resources committed to sustainability a factor

a key aim for the shortterm future will be to incorporate the full range of issues into
every stage of the supply chain this will include approaches to suppliers by means
of the supplier questionnaire

while incorporating the issues into the questionnaire a system should be initiated
for incorporation of the new factors into the audit and other processes as well as
subsequent monitoring of supplier performance

in addition to this pvc is made by electrolysis of salt water which produces chlorine which is then
combined with ethylene obtained from oil to form vinyl chloride monomer or vcm molecules of vcm
are linked in a process known as polymerisation to form a fine white powder which when mixed with
additives gives pvc its special qualities

much has been written on the subject by the mhra at national level and by the international ec
scientific community level at an international level the dilemma is that despite these unsustainable
factors of raw material unresolved claims on leaching of dehps and toxins produced on destruction

all of these packaging issues are important considerations in primary clinical situations
where speed and ease of access to products are essential however vygon considers
the high cost approach as an investment of fundamental importance

product packaging is a major issue as identified by vygon uk ltd stakeholders
through comprehensive environmental programmes arising from iso 14001
implementation and maintenance the subject has received a great deal of attention
boxes and cartons are obtained from suppliers claiming sustainable material sources
and processes while usage and range is constantly under review it is however
necessary to strike a balance between reducing cardboard quality against the box
becoming nonprotective testing has resulted in economies on box materials that do
not go as far as compromising product protection again this is particularly important
in relation to the type of product produced vygon has spent many years arriving at
the optimum level of volume per box and the correct constituent strength to enable
appropriate protection there is now a small range of standardised cartons that may be
used across a wider range of products

manufacturing

responsibility
accreditations in particular iso 14001 help us manage and reduce our impact on the
environment therefore addressing many stakeholder concerns they also ensure the
perpetual process of renewed objectives and achievement monitoring

specific issues raised by the stakeholder concern waste disposal and social concerns
but the impact of the product throughout its life includes at this stage the impact on
the environment

combining the social and environmental issues the onus is on vygon sa to
demonstrate corporate responsibility towards the community in particular relating to
noise and airborne pollution noise pollution responsibility is covered by
threeyearly reviews of noise levels as well as constant supervision of machinery the
main contributor to noise pollution under iso 14001 different levels of noise are set
for day and night while the procurement of new machines includes rigorous noise level
testing

priorities        			
the djsi registered suppliers require no immediate attention contact should be maintained in the shortterm purely as a
stakeholder relationship

a plan will be drawn up to establish where the iso 13485 accredited suppliers may be encouraged to include social
elements of sustainability within their company procedures all assistance will be provided by vygon uk ltd to establish
this situation

a plan will be established to approach the nonsustainable supplier with a view to
the phased introduction of key issues of sustainability as already illustrated
operating within the healthcare market requires a high level of compliance
much of which overlaps with sustainability an initial discussion and
investigation should reveal the supplier as being further advanced in
sustainability than they believe without the benefit of knowledge of
sustainability requirements

the business responsibility for sustainable development project promotes research
and policy dialogue on corporate social and environmental responsibility it examines
whether or not the company is taking meaningful steps to improve its social and
environmental record particularly in dealing with developing countries

where materiality relating to suppliers covered a wide range of subjects principally
through the issue of product impact throughout its lifespan vygon uk ltd on a
global front is limited to packaging waste and transport emissions on an operational
level it is more extensive principal aims have been to establish a basis for issue
measurement and the infrastructure to achieve it in other words reporting what is
going to happen and where our priorities lie

a fleet of 60 vehicles at the time covering

   fuel monitoring and management

   efficient way possible                                                                vygon uk ltd has decided to convert to the diesel

   in order to achieve further improvements in the costefficiency of running the fleet

4 there are clearly defined targets for implementation over the next three years

     monitoring fuel costs on a monthly basis with detailed information provided        there has been no concerted policy to reduce mileage
      to the fleet manager on the mileage travelled by every vehicle in the fleet and     by the sales teams due largely to the method of sales
      the volume and cost of fuel consumed                                               support and training required for the type of product

transport to central stores within the nhs
vygon uk ltd established a close association with the supplies departments of the nhs
before they evolved from regional health authority levels into national organisations
nhs supplies authority nhs purchasing and supply agency nhs pasa and
subsequently the nhs supply chain an organisation that is operated for the nhs by
dhl this partnership has been maintained and advanced to a cooperative arrangement
constantly seeking ways to improve the efficiency of providing hospitals with their medical
disposable products as well as reducing supply chain costs whenever possible

the effect of this arrangement is that the centralised storage and distribution organisation
at vygon uk ltd in turn passes on products to the centralised storage and distribution
organisation within the nhs thus forming the basis for reduced emissions by eliminating
the need for deliveries to every hospital trust in the uk 597 of the value of vygon
products were passed through the nhs supply chain and equivalents in scotland
northern ireland and wales in 2009 a proportion that is growing by the year the
products that are not available from nhs central stores are invariably specialist products
for which no centralised storage and distribution is available or the nhs trust has chosen
not to use the central stores some are routed through third party distributors chosen by
individual hospital trusts to supply their storage and distribution needs

vygon employs national carriers to consolidate product deliveries to the seven centralised
stores in england the centralised store in scotland the two central stores in wales and
the central store in northern ireland carriers employed by vygon all have environmental
policies of their own




                                                                                                                                                       39

vygon business responsibility                                                                                




nhs supply chain is iso 14001 registered and is signed up to the united nations global compact
the partnership with nhs supply chain has produced a number of innovative solutions to the supply
chain costs and sustainability for example vygon were one of the pioneer suppliers involved in the
cross docking programme this involved the majority of vygon products approximately 1200 line
items appearing in the nhs catalogue even though only about 300 line items were actually held in
stock the nonstock items were requested electronically by the hospital or clinic from nhs supply
chain who in turn ordered electronically from vygon the result being that nonstock products could
meet the stocked products at the central store and be delivered at the same time once again the
outcome represented further reduction in emissions through use of nhs vehicles that would visit the
hospitals carrying coordinated consignments

as a key supplier vygon uk ltd is involved fully with business continuity planning examples of its
effectiveness are the london bombings in july 2005 when vygon was placed on standby to provide
emergency supplies at short notice as well as the contingency stocks bought to cater for the potential
swine flu pandemic early in 2010

this year has seen a development in the partnership with vehicles from the nhs supply chains fleet
calling at vygon after delivering to local hospitals to collect vygon consignments the exercise is
known as backhauling this serves to avoid vehicles returning to the nhs store empty as well as the
additional expense of the carrier service

the shortterm future offers dhl returning used pallets to us and enabling reuse dhl have
committed to returning a minimum of 75 of the pallets savings result in both pallet purchase by
vygon and disposal by nhs supply chain




                                                                                                                40

other transport policy                             backhauling has created savings to nhs supply chain suppliers
other transport situations relating to a typical
                                                   of    995438 miles in 2009                   995215kg c02
company would normally include items such
as shared lifts use of public transport or
cycling to work in considering these the
location of vygon must be taken into account
cirencester is a small town surrounded by
rural villages the nearest large towns are
swindon and cheltenham we therefore have
little opportunity for shared lifts due to the
dispersed nature of employees homes those
that live closely and work the same hours do
presently share lifts public transport within
cotswold villages in particular is sparse or
nonexistent and the distance between
villages and cirencester is too great to
consider cycling or walking for these reasons
this area is seen as a low priority but will      using nhs supply chain reduces average nhs trust vehicle miles
be assessed again once the company has

general situation
our initial aim will therefore be to establish procedural and documented priorities which
cover all existing sustainability issues it will include the addition of performance figures
from which targets will be decided by the sustainability steering group each issue will be
assessed in order to formulate a comprehensive list of priorities

paper use
when addressing the subject of paper usage this report coincides with another major
initiative the single biggest usage of paper is with the production of reports and call
analysis for each member of the sales team call analysis is a daily occurrence customer
usage reports are monthly the latter however involves significant usage of paper

there are two areas of significant paper usage that for office use and that produced for
use of the sales team the latter is in the process of being addressed analysis has been
made of the costs involved in producing paper reports and other documentation and
has shown a figure of nearly 3500 may be saved from financial expenditure and paper
disposal by the use of electronic paperwork

outlet for this is the product donations made to areas of the world or
troubled countries that are in significant need of this kind of help

to quality of service and support the greater the endorsement of          ireland
such claims however in terms of sustainability vygon does not
intend to rest on its laurels one example of this is the number of        transporting some vital medical supplies to mwanza in tanzania

independent assurance statement
scope and objectives

two tomorrows europe limited has undertaken independent assurance of the pdf
version of the vygon uk 200910 business responsibility report

the assurance process was conducted in accordance with aa1000as 2008 we
were engaged to provide type 1 assurance which covers
         evaluation of adherence to the aa1000aps 2008 principles of inclusivity
           materiality and responsiveness the principles
we additionally checked key claims in the report and provided a performance
information briefing note in support of the development of assurable performance
reporting we have not checked data provided in the report

we provided a third party check of vygon uk ltds application of the global
reporting initiatives gri g3 sustainability reporting guidelines

responsibilities of the directors of vygon uk ltd and of the assurance
providers

the directors of vygon uk ltd have sole responsibility for the preparation of the
report

we were not involved in the preparation of any part of the report we have no other
contract with vygon uk ltd our statement represents our independent opinion and
is intended to inform all of vygon uk ltds stakeholders including management

our team comprised dave knight sini forssell and elvin ozensoy further
information including individual competencies relating to the team can be found at
wwwtwotomorrowscom

basis of our opinion

our work was designed to gather evidence with the objective of providing moderate
assurance as defined in aa1000as 2008 we undertook the following activities
       review of the current sustainability issues that could affect vygon uk
          ltd and are of interest to stakeholders
       interviews with selected directors and senior managers responsible for
          management of sustainability issues and review of selected evidence to
          support issues discussed
       review of vygon uk ltds approach to stakeholder engagement and
          evidence providing detail of the outputs of engagements
       review of information provided to us by vygon uk ltd on its reporting
          and management processes relating to the principles
       site visits to cirencester head office and distribution centre and to
          nearby warehousing
       review of supporting evidence for prioritised claims in the report
       we reviewed and provided feedback on drafts of the report

in order to provide a third party check of vygons application of the global reporting
initiative g3 guidelines we cross checked coverage of profile information and
performance indicators as described in the gri index against the disclosure and
protocol requirements of c level as per gri g3 

our opinion

on the basis of the work undertaken nothing came to our attention to suggest that
the report does not properly describe vygon uk ltds adherence to the principles

we confirm that the report provides sufficient coverage to meet a c gri application
level

observations

without affecting our assurance opinion we also provide the following observations

the report is an ambitious undertaking for a first time reporter and a comparatively
small company in particular it is less common to commission assurance for a first
time report vygon uk ltd is clear on the business rationale for doing so  reporting
and assuring to recognised international standards grows confidence for work in this
area in line with the expectations of their key customer  the uk national health
service and supports vygons approach as a leading supplier

vygon have used the reporting process not just as way to communicate but also to
create a basis for structured performance improvements and as a way to explore
sustainability implications for the wider group this is to be commended however in
doing so the report sometimes confuses internal management and communication
needs

inclusivity concerns the participation of stakeholders in developing and
achieving an accountable and strategic response to sustainability we looked
for evidence that this was happening across the business

vygon uk ltd systematically engages through a range of mainly informal
processes as outlined in the report providing the company with an understanding of
key stakeholder concerns

evidence of how engagement has informed decision making was generally available
examples of how this approach has had a direct impact on policy and practice such
as support for and involvement in nhs sustainability initiatives are provided in the
report and substantiated by our research

we recommend that vygon simplifies how it presents its relationships with key
stakeholders and other engagements


material issues are those which are necessary for stakeholders to make
informed judgments concerning vygon uk ltd and its impacts we looked at
the processes vygon uk ltd has in place for understanding material issues
and how well these are communicated in the report

the report explains how the company has systematically evaluated and prioritised its
key sustainability impacts taking into account their relevance and significance to the
business and wider stakeholders it is clear that considerable effort has been put into
understanding how vygon uk ltd can improve sustainability performance within the
context of its value chain

 as a first report most of the issues have been included to varying degrees we
 recommend using the principle of materiality to enable the report to better reflect their
 relative prioritisation for example the balance between coverage of environment and
 health and safety issues


 responsiveness concerns the extent to which an organisation responds to
 stakeholder issues we looked for evidence of an adequate response

 the report contains useful information of how vygon uk ltd has responded to
 stakeholder requests and expectations which is substantiated by supporting
 evidence the forward looking information enables users to understand how vygon
 uk ltd intends to respond to the challenges and opportunities stated

 the company presents a mix of information that it needs internally to understand and
 to manage sustainability issues and information relevant to enable stakeholders to
 make decisions about the company this is openly offered in the spirit of it being the
 first report in future reports we recommend identifying and removing content that is
 more useful for internal management to enable the clearer presentation of that which
 remains

 references to established frameworks standards and indices can help organisations
 to structure management programmes effectively and to compare performance to
 peers and other companies as management and reporting develops we recommend
 clarifying which are most relevant to and requirements of customers of vygon
 companies and of suppliers

 the presentation of information across the life cycle enables users to see where the
 issues impact on the business and where vygon uk can influence vygon sas
 approach and performance however this can become confusing at times with
 issues being discussed across the sections we recommend consolidating coverage
 of issues where possible and clarifying how far vygon sa approaches such as
 transport policy apply to vygon uk

 as sustainability reporting becomes more integrated into the business and as the key
 non financial measures are clarified we would anticipate the report becoming more
 succinct and user focused

 claims made in the report
 based on a review of claims prioritised using the principle of materiality we have
 been provided with evidence to substantiate the claims made in the report
