hasbro government affairs worked collaboratively with
us congress and nongovernmental organization ngo
partners to encourage development of one uniform
national standard for chemical safety this led in 2016 to
the passage of the chemical safety improvement act
csia which was the first substantial revision to chemical
laws in the us since 1976 the csia is designed to provide
a unified national approach to chemicals management
ensuring that products are uniformly safe for children
across all 50 states

that manufacture hasbro products

2015 challenges and
looking to the future
people and the planet are core to our purpose of making the world
a better place for children and their families this is why we continue
to make csr a business priority and have long been committed to
doing the right thing for our employees our consumers and the
communities in which we serve

we believe csr is a journey of continuous improvement  one that
is guided towards points of departure rather than points of arrival 
full of challenges and key learnings this ultimately deepens our
understanding of the complex issues of the world in which we operate
and inspires us to raise the bar and strive to be better as we work
to elevate our csr efforts in the future we feel its important to
reflect on the challenges we faced in 2015 and share how we
are looking to improve in 2016 and beyond




engaging stakeholders through
a materiality assessment

hasbro began its formal csr practice in 2011 and at our five
year anniversary we find it appropriate to both reflect on
our journey and to gather insight on the relative importance
of csr issues including key environmental social and
governance topics in 2016 we will conduct a materiality
assessment and evolve our csr strategy accordingly



resetting our operational
environment goals

in 2015 hasbro sold its two owned and operated manufac
turing facilities3 which significantly reduced our operational
footprint and affected our progress in meeting some of our
2020 environmental goals to address this we are creating
new goals in 2016 and restating our baseline one of the
challenges we will face in defining future goals is identifying
significant reduction opportunities given that since 2002
we have made considerable improvements in conserving
energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions at our
owned and operated facilities
