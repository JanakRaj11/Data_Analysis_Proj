                                     atria  finnish with international presence

heritage atria is one of the leading food companies in the nordic countries russia and the baltic region with experience
stretching over 110 years

four business areas atria finland atria scandinavia atria russia and atria baltic

atrias customer groups are consumer goods retailers food service customers and the food industry atria also has a fast
food concept based on its own brands

atrias roots go back to 1903 when its oldest shareholding cooperative was founded atria plc is listed on nasdaq helsinki




     corporate responsibility report 2015                                                                                 4

                              openness is part of atrias daily work




transparent operations are essential in the food sector particularly in the meat industry ceo juha gröhn how would you
describe the significance of openness and responsible conduct in general to atrias business

atria is a large food company that produces food for hundreds of thousands of people in finland sweden denmark russia
and estonia on a daily basis i dont think im far off the mark in saying that everyone is interested in what their food tastes
like the majority of people also want to know where food comes from what it contains and how it was made and almost
everyone is interested in the price of food or the right pricequality ratio

atria must have  and we do have  a simple answer to all these concerns it adds up to a long list of questions and answers
that encompasses dozens of stages throughout the food chain from the field to the consumers table people expect our
entire chain to be transparent and open and we are meeting these expectations openness is an integral part of atrias
responsible conduct and daily operations

particularly in the nordic countries people are interested in the origin of food and its raw materials i can confidently say
that atria is a trailblazer in this industry in telling about the origin of meat and about the meat chain by operating openly
providing information and contributing to an open and honest discussion we can build trust between us and our
stakeholders this creates a winwin situation despite the fact that certain matters may still need to be improved

i think excellent daily operations form the foundation for atrias corporate responsibility as they do for nearly all other
matters they are a source of security and satisfaction not just for us at atria but also for customers and consumers
partners and shareholders

atria was able to consolidate its financial basis in 2015 for example its equity ratio increased however the business
environment was challenging from the perspective of growth and profitability how would you describe it

there were three key challenges in atrias business environment falling sales prices in finland historically low meat export
prices and a shift in demand towards lowerpriced products this structural change in demand could be observed in all of
atrias home markets there is naturally plenty of variation within product groups for example some convenience food
segments showed strong development and growth was also seen



     corporate responsibility report 2015                                                                                   5

perhaps the most positive aspect of the year was growth in volumes in finland sweden and denmark more food was sold
than in the previous year however more attention must be paid to the price of food and thereby to the profitability of the
food chain as a whole particularly in finland

given the economic climate atrias results were reasonable in recent years we have made progress in productivity and
process management in all of our business areas our net sales and ebit decreased from the previous year the two main
reasons for this were the sale of the falbygdens cheese business to arla in sweden and the weak exchange rate of the rouble
against the euro

the name of atrias new strategy for 20162020 is healthy growth what kind of growth does it mean

in short it means growth in business volumes  in euros and in kilos  without endangering profitability we need an organic
element to growth in our current home market and with our current product groups but we also keep an open mind towards
new opportunities acquisitions could be one way of achieving growth

we are driving healthy growth in seven focus areas one of these is resource optimisation in practice this means careful
and economical use of both natural and human resources and other factors of production for example valuable meat raw
material must not be wasted in industrial processes besides technology this requires the continuous development of
competence and attitudes when everyone involved in the long food chain does their work conscientiously the impact is
huge products jobs the economy and the environment are all affected

                                            stakeholders are important to atria


atrias good food chain consists of primary production industrial production customers and consumers stakeholders are
strongly present in the food chain all the way from raw material procurement to the finished products and their use
listening to stakeholders and their wishes is one of the key pillars of corporate responsibility for atria

atria uses various studies surveys and analyses as well as personal interaction with stakeholders to gain extensive knowledge
of their expectations however what is most important is the development of operations in continuous and close interaction
with stakeholders

consumers customers personnel meat producers and shareholders are strategically important stakeholders to atria other
stakeholders include raw material and material suppliers authorities financial institutions educational institutes and the
media

since 2010 the principles practices and results of atrias responsible operations have been brought together in the atrias
handprint programme providing employees and external stakeholders with information on responsibility is also part of the
handprint programme  as is this corporate responsibility site

stakeholder responsibility plays a key role

atria only deals with those primary producers and subcontractors customers and other business partners who are known to
be trustworthy and honest the company favours partners who in addition to offering a reasonable price and high quality
are able to demonstrate that they operate in accordance with ethically acceptable practices for example one of atrias
selection criteria for material andor raw material suppliers is the quality of their environmental management system

partnership with customers means longterm cooperation in which both parties listen to and understand each others needs
wishes and opportunities also in relation to responsibility consumer preferences and wishes ultimately determine the
product groups and products atria supplies to retailers and other customers insights into consumer needs gained from
research on consumer behaviour guide atrias product development and marketing

treating animals well is the key to profitable and responsible production animal health and good output primarily depend on
the professionalism of producers good care of animals systematic feeding and sound management of conditions atria
ensures that animals are treated well in its chain by means of quality requirements included in its production contracts and
the terms and conditions of animal purchases and sales atria has prepared production handbooks on each production
species to assist producers these handbooks provide clear guidance on the breeding feeding living conditions and health care
of animals

atrias contract producers are required to comply with the instructions in the handbooks and their operations are
monitored through veterinary checks at intervals of 112 months depending on the type of farm

in the atria meat chain animals do not undergo any unnecessary painful physical alterations

procedures considered necessary for the time being include male pig castration to stave off boar taint and calf de
horning male pigs are surgically castrated within five days of birth using pain analgesia we are actively investigating
alternative solutions to eliminate castration in the chain

calves are reared in freely roaming groups and sharp horns constitute a physical risk for other animals and a safety risk
for carers the atria bovine service pays extra to have calves dehorned by a veterinary officer using analgesia in group
rearing facilities in atrias chain animals do not have their tails docked chickens are not debeaked and bull calves are
not castrated

                      pork marked with the laatuvastuu quality responsibility label


meat marked with the laatuvastuu label is produced on farms that belong to a certified national programme concerning
animal health and product safety in practice this means that the farms are constantly at the sikava national level all of
atrias contract farms are laatuvastuu farms when the producers provide chain information they also provide assurance
that all of the animals they send for slaughter are from locations that were at the sikava national level on the date of
collection for slaughter

laatuvastuu is based on the sikava health care and monitoring system for pigs which is maintained by animal welfare ett
and which enables information to be transferred between farms industrial companies and veterinarians sikava is used to
monitor the implementation of health care programmes carry out health classifications for pig farms and communicate
current affairs

                               animal welfare protects consumers

the health of finnish animals is also a form of consumer protection

a good disease status and firstclass animal welfare are among the greatest assets of finnish production animals
healthy and wellkept animals are the cornerstone of efficient economical and safe domestic food production
production animals receive very little medication by international comparison  particularly antibiotics  and the
occurrence of drug residues in food is extremely rare antibiotics are not used for preventive treatment in finland
instead diseased animals are treated with appropriate care avoiding unnecessary medication drug dosages are
determined by a veterinary officer who also oversees the pharmaceutical records and drug use at farms the prudent use
of antibiotics also reduces the emergence of strains of bacteria resistant to antibioticsno growth enhancers or hormone
preparations are used at finnish farms

infectious animal diseases are systematically resisted in accordance with resistance programmes prepared in
collaboration with animal welfare ett atrias preventive health care work has been fruitful decades of determined
work has led to us completely eliminating porcine enzootic pneumonia mange and dysentery from our pig chain
salmonella has been identified extremely rarely in atrias production animal chain and deviations are subject to
immediate intervention all identified infections of salmonella are eliminated

                                 how do atrias products affect the environment


we have rough information about the magnitude of the environmental impact of different primary production methods and
product groups assessing the environmental impact of individual products is not in our view a sensible undertaking as food
production is part of a more significant whole in which the correct choices must be made the environmental impact of
atrias products is minimised by choices made in procurement eg purchasing nationallyproduced meat raw material and by
processing the meat in a way that maximises material efficiency care is also taken to ensure that production lines are
energyefficient

we continuously monitor the environmental efficiency of our production lines in the industry the highest quantity of
energy and water is consumed by highly processed products such as precooked meat products however processing raw
materials so that they meet different consumer needs and situations reduces overall raw material wastage and therefore also
reduces the environmental impact of products we work to reduce food wastage at all stages of the food production chain



tangible respect for resources

at atria environmental responsibility means tangible operational development that is why we measure the direct
environmental effects of our operations including energy consumption water consumption and wastewater values and we
have set targets for improving measurable results in these areas we report annually on the achievements we have made in
the field of environmental efficiency as part of our corporate responsibility report

we have not yet considered it appropriate to simplify the environmental impact of our products throughout their entire life
cycles in such a way that it could be condensed into a single label on the packaging instead we aim to use this website and
dialogue in social media channels to communicate the overall environmental impact related to our products and provide
information on how we are able to influence this

                                            product packaging however packaging has an important role the packaging
                                            must protect the product on its journey from the packaging plant via the
                                            shop to the consumers home this is also an effective way to prevent food

the key objective in the environmental strategy period is to support business through a controlled use of natural resources
the objectives have been adapted to changes in the business environment of which the most significant continue to be the
advancement of energy efficiency and the prevention of waste generation



energy consumption

the heat and steam needed by atria are generated using natural gas woodbased renewable fuel peat and fuel oil in
electricity consumption the ratio of renewable and nonrenewable sources of energy depends on the market situation and is
determined computationally using energiakolmio oys statistics

in the period under review total energy consumption decreased by 32 per cent and consumption in relation to the kilograms
produced by 19 per cent




water consumption

at atria clean water is indispensable for the operation of processes and washing of production facilities the origin of water
does not have a major environmental impact in atrias operating environment but the adequacy of water and pumping
capacity are critical for atrias operations that is why the company aims to constantly increase water efficiency and work
with local entities to secure an uninterrupted supply of water

atria finland uses the most water and its absolute water consumption decreased by six per cent in the period under review
however atria finland uses water efficiently compared to other national industry players

consumption at atria scandinavia increased by eight per cent and atria russia decreased as much as 14 per cent the entire


     corporate responsibility report 2015                                                                                 41

groups absolute water consumption decreased by four per cent aggregate water consumption relative to production
output in the three business areas decreased by three per cent

wastewater

of all wastewater generated by atria 80 per cent is pretreated at production plants before being flushed into the municipal
sewage network plantspecific environmental permits determine the threshold values for wastewater quality the plants
monitor compliance with the values carefully a predictable stable organic load in wastewater is important to the operation
of wastewater treatment plants

in the period under review bod7 load and wastewater quality was in compliance with the permit requirements

the reported bod load value is a sum of the amount of wastewater and the average bod7 levels measured over one year as
bod7 values are not measured in all business areas their load has been estimated in reporting on the basis of loads
generated by similar facilities

the bod7 value illustrates the amount of oxygen required for the microbiological oxidation of organic material over seven days

materialefficient food production

about 98 per cent of the byproducts of atrias core operations are channelled to reuse of all incoming materials only
about one per mille ends up as waste to landfill or hazardous waste for which there is no use

the market price of raw materials and local infrastructure play a key role in the eventual destination of byproducts the
prevention of waste generated during a products life cycle is greatly influenced by the choice of packaging
