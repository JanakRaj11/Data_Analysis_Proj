                         how has biocon consistently stayed ahead of the curve
                         biocons focus on innovation and differentiation predates our entry into
                         the pharmaceuticals sector our entrepreneurial culture rooted in building
                         strengths in the then nascent field of biotechnology was instrumental in us
                         identifying opportunities based on market and technology trends both during
                         our initial years as an enzyme company and during our subsequent foray into
                         biopharmaceuticals this led us to proactively invest in capabilities aligned to
                         these opportunities to be ahead of the curve

                         biocon commenced its pharma journey in 1999 by leveraging its
                         capabilities in fermentation technologies derived from its long experience
                         in manufacturing enzymes this was unlike other companies in india which
                         were largely focused on generics made by chemical synthesis furthermore
                         we were amongst the early movers in developing a portfolio of fermentation
                         derived statins which gave us a leadership position in this segment we
                         simultaneously chose to expand our strategic options from small molecules
                         like statins to recombinant proteins like insulin to address the growing
                         healthcare challenges associated with diabetes

                         we did not hesitate to exploit differentiated technologies such as a
                         proprietary yeast platform based on pichia pastoris to create a portfolio
                         of insulins in 2003 we initiated work on mammalian cell culture based
                         expression systems to develop monoclonal antibodies mabs targeting
                         cancer and autoimmune diseases our product portfolio was not limited to
                         generics or biosimilars we sought opportunities to be ahead of the curve
                         in addressing unmet needs in these therapeutic segments through novel
                         biologics and novel targets these were marked by high entry barriers wherein
the early anticipation   we were required to make significant investments in a full range of rd
of the increasing        capabilities spanning process and analytical development to preclinical and
dominance of             clinical research
biologics in global      the early anticipation of the increasing dominance of biologics in global
development              development pipelines helped us to be ahead of the curve in crafting a
pipelines helped us      differentiated product portfolio based on fermentation and recombinant
to be ahead of the      technologies we believe these would provide us a sustainable competitive
curve                  advantage in the years ahead



                                                                                       ceos qa        23

                                       how did being ahead of the curve translate into tangible
                                       achievements at biocon
                                       the strategic choice of focusing on biotech and fermentationderived
                                       biopharmaceuticals resulted in a unique and differentiated product portfolio
                                       straddling fermentationderived small molecules recombinant proteins
                                       including insulins and mabs

                                       biocons growth in the mid 2000s triggered by the first approval of our
                                       statin api facility by the us fda was driven by our early mover advantage
                                       in lovastatin pravastatin and simvastatin we were amongst only a few
                                       companies with approved apis for these fermentationderived statins which
                                       helped lower the competitive intensity otherwise typical of chemistrybased
                                       apis we expanded our portfolio of fermentationderived apis to establish
                                       a strong competitive position in immunosuppressants and certain other
                                       speciality apis

                                       likewise we were one among just two nonoriginator companies to
                                       commercialize recombinant human insulin in india in 2004 and subsequently
                                       rapidly expand our footprint into multiple emerging markets this was
during the year                        followed by the launch of insulin glargine in india in 2009 and more recently
gone by we further                    by an important endorsement of our product quality on account of the
demonstrated                           approval and launch of glargine disposable pens in japan in 2016

diverse technology                     landscape and significant financial outlay for rd and manufacturing
platforms and scale                    infrastructure we proactively mitigated some of these risks by entering into

                                                                  biocon limited




biosimilar mabs in 2009 which was then expanded to insulin analogs in 2013
these partnerships structured as a sharing of risks and rewards leveraged
the complementary strengths of each partner and were a forerunner of many
global partnerships that exist today in the biosimilar space including those
involving many innovator companies i believe that partnering as a strategic
choice early in the investment cycle of biosimilars is another example of how
we have been ahead of the curve

a tangible outcome of our partnership with mylan has been the launch of
biosimilar trastuzumab in 2014 in india and other emerging markets our
collaboration also reached important milestones in fy17 with our trastuzumab
and pegfilgrastim dossiers being accepted for review by the us fda and ema
followed by our glargine filing in europe

what does biocons ahead of the curve strategy mean for its
prospects
biocons annual report to shareholders for fy16 highlighted our efforts and
initial successes at being credibly capable this was based on our first
approval for a biosimilar product namely insulin glargine in a very demanding
developed market like japan and the progress we had made in advancing our
other biosimilar programs through the clinic

during the year gone by we further demonstrated our capabilities through
the dossier submissions in europe by our partner mylan for three biosimilar
products based on diverse technology platforms and scale of operations
namely trastuzumab pegfilgrastim and insulin glargine last year we also had
the us fda accept the dossiers of trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim for review
with insulin glargine to follow in early fy18 these three products target a
market opportunity of about usd 1820 billion at current innovator pricing
we continue to develop the other biosimilar assets in our collaboration with
mylan

our nearterm growth in biosimilars will be driven by expanding our footprint
in key emerging markets through strong local partnerships product approvals

                                       and commercial success in the developed markets of the us and europe would
                                       be significant milestones that can help the company reinvent itself and lay
                                       a strong foundation to stay ahead of the curve in the next decade these
                                       will be supported by capacity expansions as needed in a phased manner and
                                       additions to our product portfolio to cater to the next wave of opportunities
                                       we will continue to adopt a riskbalanced approach to advance our promising
                                       firstinclass novel biologics that target critical unmet needs

                                       we will strive to remain ahead of the curve in developing fermentation
                                       derived complex potent or niche small molecule generic apis and forward
                                       integrate them to finished dosage forms

                                       we believe that our strategy of being ahead of the curve through a well
                                       diversified portfolio of small molecules biosimilars and novel biologics can
                                       help us overcome the headwinds facing the generic pharmaceutical sector
                                       today in terms of pricing pressure tougher regulatory expectations and
                                       increased competition

                       clinical study of our novel insulin tregopil oral insulin to validate its
                       positioning as an orallydelivered rapidacting prandial insulin and establish

                      can you comment on your transition to the new indian accounting
                      standards from fy17
                      biocon is amongst the early adopters of the new indian accounting standards
                      referred commonly as ind as the transition from the older standard to
                      ind as starting april 1 2016 applied to both our standalone and
                      consolidated financial statements

                      in line with ind as we changed our segment reporting to better reflect the
                      way we view and measure our overall business we started reporting four
                      segments  small molecules biologics branded formulations and research
                      services  instead of just two biopharmaceuticals and research services
                      which we used to report under the previous accounting standard this is in
                      line with the growth strategies represented by the four business segments and
                      provides a clearer picture of those segments to our shareholders than earlier

                      how do you rate the performance this year
                      the overall financial performance during the year was very satisfactory and
                      in line with our expectations in fy17 our consolidated revenue at h40787
                      million grew by 18 while net profit at h6121 million reported 11 growth
                      adjusting for an exceptional income in fy16 net profit actually jumped 54
                      to h6199 million during the year earnings before interest taxes depreciation
                       amortization ebitda for the year rose 34 to h11366 million while
                      ebitda margin markedly improved to 28 from 24 last year

                      the extraordinary gain recorded in the previous year was on account of the
                      deferred revenue recognition pertaining to rhinsulin development and
                      impairment of an intangible asset in biocon sa
adjusting for an      the companys strong performance during the year was led by the small
exceptional income    molecules business reporting a growth of 12 at h16330 million and
in fy16 net profit   biologics business at h5793 million reporting a growth of 43 branded
actually jumped 54   formulations business which now includes sales in uae reported a growth of
to h6199 million     24 at h5489 million and research services through syngene contributed

                                       what does your operating margins trajectory look like in the medium
                                       term
                                       the companys core operating margins which is operating margins adjusted
                                       for licensing income rd expenses and forex gains or losses continue to
                                       remain healthy in spite of increased operational expenses like salaries and
                                       other costs in fy17 our ebitda margin was at 28 while core operating
                                       margins stood at 32 resulting from growth in our small molecules business
                                       and biosimilars business in the emerging markets

                                       in the mediumterm we will endeavor to maintain our core operating
                                       margins at 30 levels despite an increase in rd expenses and inclusion of
                                       malaysian expenses in the pl we anticipate margins to improve once we
                                       launch biosimilar products in the developed markets and enjoy a reasonable
                                       penetration that reflects in the optimum utilization of our manufacturing

                                       on july 1 2017 what would be its anticipated impact on biocon
                                       from a longterm perspective gst is good for the nation as it will replace a
                                       number of different taxes companies have to deal with currently with a single
                                       nationwide tax that would simplify operations

                                       we do expect a shortterm impact on the branded formulations india business
                                       as it is anticipated that the distribution channel could destock market
                                       inventory before gst rollout and hence sales in q1 fy18 could be impacted
                                       the impact could rollover into q2 fy18 as well depending on how quickly the
                                       channel becomes gstready and compliant we expect things to normalize by
                                       the second half of the fiscal
in the mediumterm                    under gst the company can claim input credit for certain items which
we will endeavor to                    was not possible in the earlier tax structure however these savings would
maintain our core                      ultimately have to be passed on to customers given the antiprofiteering
operating margins                      clause in the gst bill
at 30 levels
despite an increase                    what is the expected tax rate for biocon at the consolidated level for
in rd expenses                        fy18
and inclusion of                       at a consolidated level the effective tax rate for fy17 was 19 after
malaysian expenses                     adjusting for onetime deferred tax benefit that the company availed the
in the pl                            effective tax rate was 22 for the year

this rate is expected to go up by 200300 bps 100 bps  1 in fy18 due to
the expiry of the 10year tax holiday for some of our manufacturing facilities
further the government is gradually phasing out the rd tax benefit availed
by biocon thus far the 200 weighted deduction will reduce to 150 in
fy18 and be completely eliminated in the next couple of years

biocon has stopped capitalization of expenses from the malaysia plant
at the end of fy17 how will it affect the bottomline in fy18
we stopped capitalizing preoperating expenses relating to malaysia plant at
the end of fy17 consequently depreciation and fixed expenses related to
the malaysia plant will be charged to the pl account starting q1 fy18 we
estimate annual depreciation of approximately usd 18 million and fixed plant
operating expenses which includes the finance cost to be approximately
usd 30 million

we have already commenced commercialization from malaysia plant with
supply of rhinsulin for the domestic market in fy18 we also anticipate
approvals followed by commercial supplies in other emerging markets where
previously our india plant was qualified lastly we will partly utilize the plant
for development of other pipeline insulin products wherein the costs will be
shared with our partner mylan or will be accounted under rd expenses

as a result of the above we do expect an adverse impact on our bottomline
from malaysian operations in fy18 however we will endeavour to minimize
the impact

what will be the trajectory of rd expenditure across the foreseeable
future
the company will continue to focus on development of biosimilars complex
generics and novel biologics these programs require intensive rd efforts
and have long gestation periods we have guided for gross annual rd
expenses to be in the range of 1215 of sales excluding syngene we
expect rd expenses in fy18 to be in line with that guidance

                                          we establish technical feasibility once we have demonstrated biosimilarity
                                          of our product in terms of safety and efficacy through various preclinical
                                          and clinical activities this occurs upon receipt of regulatory approval for
                                          the product in a major territory

                                          we establish commercial feasibility once we have demonstrated that
                                          the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits
                                          this occurs when it is probable that we will be able to successfully

                                          once the technical and commercial feasibilities are established and we
                                          believe we have adequate technical financial and other resources to
                                          complete the development activity we capitalize all future development
                                          costs incurred
we also have
sufficient leverage                    b the expenditure can be measured reliably

in terms of a new large project we expect to start construction of our second
monoclonal antibodies facility in bengaluru during fy18 after receipt of all
regulatory approvals the investment will be phased over a period of three to
four years and the associated capex will be shared with our partner mylan

what is the debt position of the company how does biocon plan to
fund the upcoming capex would biocon need to raise funds from the
markets to fund its future growth plans
biocon has a consolidated gross debt long term plus short term debt of
h23025 million as on march 31 2017 with corresponding cash  liquid
investments of h22551 million excluding syngene the gross debt and cash 
liquid investments stood at h14961 million and h11875 million respectively

cash  liquid investments on our balance sheet coupled with free cash flow
from operations will be used to fund a significant portion of the capex we
also have sufficient leverage on the balance sheet to raise additional debt
to fund the remaining portion of capex we do not foresee raising fresh
equity funding from the capital markets to fund any of our shortterm capex
requirements

from a longterm perspective we have restructured our legal entities to reflect
each of our key business segments the new structure provides us flexibility to
unlock value and raise capital if required for any of our business segments in
the future

does biocon have a specific dividend policy
yes biocon does have a dividend policy the dividend if any will be
distributed to our shareholders depending upon multiple factors including
but not limited to our future earnings financial condition cash flows

management discussion and analysis
the global life science industry has fared well amidst the past economic downturns in light of todays volatile marketplace which is faced with economic
political and social challenges this industry is faced with reformdriven pricing pressures and increased demand for value in innovation significant global
unmet needs aided by favourable demographic trends make it likely that this industry would enjoy long term growth driven by the recent wave of
innovative therapies approved by regulators reports suggest that the global drug spending could reach 11 trillion by 2022

globally spending on healthcare correlates well with general economic strength of a country given the high contribution of the usa russia brazil and
china in global growth of healthcare spending coupled with pricing pressures in the united states and the unstable economic conditions in large emerging
markets have led to a slowdown in the global marketplace strict measures taken by the governments with regards to health care budgets and or reductions
in out ofpocket expenditures in these countries have impacted the spending aging populations rise of chronic diseases and the introduction of innovative
and frequently expensive treatments eg for cancer and hepatitis c are some of the main factors which would continue to drive growth in health care
spending however many countries have taken steps to contain health care costs that includes price control valuebased pricing and reimbursement along
with progeneric and probiosimilar policies companies are responding to the current changing market dynamics and are trying to position themselves for
continued growth through portfolio transformation mergers and acquisitions ma costcutting sharpened focus on highperforming therapeutic areas
tas and on key geographic markets

global biologics market continues to grow
growth of the pharmaceutical companies is driven by specialty products with a focus on personalized medicine which includes biologic drugs with
increased number of biologics being approved as compared to nonbiologics synthetic molecules in recent times antibody drugs have become an
increasingly significant component of the therapeutic landscape antibodies exhibit very high specificity and selectivity reducing risks of offtarget toxicity
typical for synthetic molecules and enabling personalized treatments of the top 15 pharma drugs by sales in 2016 10 drugs were biologics figure 1

possible and gained significant traction in the pharmaceutical industry as novel biologic blockbusters have continued to enter the market companies are
increasingly focusing on narrow patient populations characterized by large unmet needs and easier market access estimates by evaluate pharma indicate
that sales of biotechnology products which stood at over 165 billion in revenue in 2013 are likely to go up to 337 billion by 2022 and comprise nearly
29 of the pharmaceutical market

insurance payment mechanism to government funded healthcare to cash based outofpocket markets the access of patients to biologic treatments have
been defined accordingly

the developed markets success is led by the united states where reimbursement is widely available through private insurance or medicare federal health
insurance program for people who are 65 or older and certain others followed by the eu even in the developed markets access to biologics is not uniform
often patients struggle to cope up with the cost of continued therapy in emerging markets biologics penetration has been suboptimal given the varied
nature of payment mechanisms for drug coverage governments of emerging market countries are trending towards adoption of universal healthcare
to promote wellbeing of their citizens and reduce outofpocket costs drugs provided may include biologics like human insulin which are available at
competitive prices but seldom include expensive drugs to treat cancer and chronic inflammatory conditions hence access to biologics by patients might be
severely limited in these markets as governments are unable to afford higher priced branded biologic therapies

biosimilars landscape
biologics development is long complex and expensive resulting in patients and payers buying drugs at a very high cost this has resulted in a large unmet
need for more affordable alternatives in form of biosimilars to be made available to patients in different parts of the world

to negate the effects of high pricing of drugs we have seen an increase in biosimilar development activity globally developed markets have been a focus
area for most biologics manufacturers while emerging markets may not have attracted the level of attention the developed markets have incurred in
biosimilar environment these markets are poised to drive long term growth companies would require specific strategies to be successful in this segment
the key to success will vary based on the market chosen although each countrys environment is unique there are similarities in trends across the developed
and emerging markets

given the need for significant investments of both capital and time required for biosimilar development companies need to build the right conditions for
success to be able to a get a fair return on those investments

source deloitte winning with biosimilars opportunities in global markets

developed markets  as per deloitte the greatest biosimilar presence today figure 2 is seen in the developed markets led by the adoption seen in the
eu countries markets such as the us eu5 and japan provide growth opportunities for biosimilars aided by the availability of better defined regulatory
requirements for registration of biosimilar products and payers that are pushing to contain costs

as witnessed in the eu markets the adoption of biosimilars has been largely payerdriven figure 2 given the need to contain public health expenditures
market uptake of these products has been varied across the eu with early physician scepticism and low patient awareness in certain markets especially in
southern europe with payers which include governments in many instances proactively promoting the use of biosimilars through education of patients
and encouraging doctors to use lower cost alternatives to branded biologics biosimilar manufacturers have tasted success the recent success of infliximab
in eu more specifically the penetration levels seen in nordic countries 90 is a good example pricing discounts have varied based on the level of
penetration achieved in various markets with discounts of 2530 seen in eu5 countries these discounts may be higher in eastern europe given the higher
unmet need due to lack of sophisticated reimbursement mechanisms in nordic countries where governments have promoted the use of biosimilars we
have witnessed much steeper discounts compared to either eu5 or eastern europe this is an outcome of government tenders with guaranteed volumes and
physicians willingness to switch patients from the branded biologics to biosimilars

in japan the government is pushing doctors and incentivising pharmacies to increase use of generics and biosimilars to treat its aging population thereby
helping control spiralling drug costs japan has traditionally been a branded market so the process of adoption has been slow but encouraging from a long
term perspective

the united states market has been behind the rest of the world in adoption of biosimilars there are still areas of regulatory policy which are evolving some
points include 1 standards for interchangeability and pharmaceutical substitution 2 extrapolation of indications and 3 traceability of pharmacovigilance
reports through naming conventions that permit differentiation of products recent commentary and actions at the payer and regulatory levels and
increased political noise around drug pricing is very encouraging towards acceptance of biosimilars there are currently two biosimilars and one generic
insulin glargine commercially available in the us biosimilar filgrastim has achieved success having been launched in the market in sep15 while biosimilar



                                                                                                      management discussion and analysis                          131

infliximab was launched in nov16 initial reports suggest that generic insulin glargine launched in dec16 has also been well accepted price discounts for
the launched products are suggested to be in the range of 1520 given that providing rebates to secure formulary access is common in the us one would
expect net discounts to be higher

given the high costs of development and long developmental times there are inherent risks developers face these includes change in standard of care
delays due to potential intellectual property lawsuits and commercial challenges to establish mainstream use of these drugs therefore commercial strategies
for formulary placement physician education and increased patient awareness coupled with smart navigation of the intellectual property landscape will be
needed by companies to be successful in the developed markets most notably us in the coming years as analyst reports suggest the pace of adoption
may surprise the industry once there are a few advanced biosimilars from the current wave approved and marketed in the united states

emerging markets  while most companies would want to have presence in the developed markets a considerable opportunity exists in emerging markets
for biosimilars these markets are characterized by poor physical and financial access to current highpriced branded biologics and provide favourable long
term growth opportunities to biosimilar companies figure 2 in addition to favourable macroeconomic factors such as improving gross domestic product
gdp growth rates coupled with a growing middle class and increasing healthcare spending there is strong focus on containing costs and increasing
treatment access physicians would increase prescription rates if lower priced biosimilar alternatives were available further many of these countries have
biosimilar approval pathways in place or are finalizing guidelines in many cases the intellectual property landscape in these markets is less troublesome for
biosimilar sponsors as compared to developed markets historically emerging markets have seen very high penetration of generic drugs and similar trends
could apply to biosimilars as well signalling strong growth attainable for biosimilar manufacturers over the course of the next few years

each market would require a tailored approach due to regional country and local complexities the key to success would involve choosing the right markets
with right therapeutic areas which provide the greatest impact on the local population keeping prices competitive to secure broad access and partnering
with local companies to overcome local resource and knowledge gap getting access to local commercial capabilities distribution networks and distinctive
understanding of local stakeholders including prescribing physicians figure 3 therefore biosimilar players would have to grow sales albeit at a lower
margin than the developed markets among an increasing affluent and health conscious population

source deloitte winning with biosimilars opportunities in global markets

conclusion regulatory framework governing requirements for biosimilar development continues to evolve globally requirement of large and expensive
phase 3 trials which are currently mandated in many geographies could be waived if biosimilar sponsors are able to demonstrate biosimilarity and address
regulatory concerns around residual risk using bioassays limited population pharmacokineticpharmacodynamics pkpd phase 1 trials and technologically
sophisticated analytical tools for characterization

we have seen this in eu guidance for future development of insulin products globally as and when this process becomes mainstream and includes more
complex drugs like monoclonal antibodies it would help reduce cost and time associated with biosimilar development benefitting patients and healthcare
systems  the macros are too favourable to ignore to support the requirements of biosimilars as effective tools to bring down healthcare costs and provide
increased access to biologic therapies however risks cannot be ignored in this highly fluid environment it would require utmost focus and dedication
perseverance and access to large pool of capital to make the most of this opportunity which would play out over the next five years for the current set of
molecules under development

indian pharmaceutical industry
the indian pharmaceutical industry has seen steady growth over the last decade backed by increased exports and an expanding indian pharma market
ipm indian companies have revenues coming in from the sale of intermediates active pharmaceutical ingredients api and formulations in various global
markets these include developed markets like us europe and japan and semi developed markets across the world major indian pharma companies are now

fragmented with over 20000 players sales are dominated by branded generics with top 10 players which include both indian as well as multinational firms
accounting for over 40 of the market value

in the past few years indian companies have grown tremendously capitalizing on major blockbusters losing patent protection and paving way for generics
especially in the us market by volume indian companies supply about 20 of global generics however every passing year has left fewer patented drug
opportunities for the indian companies to launch new products the market is moving from plain vanilla drugs to more complex formulations and delivery
systems thus indian pharma companies have stepped up rd efforts in newer areas the companies are spending more to establish niche product
portfolios for future growth respiratory dermatology biosimilars and sterile injectable product development have been some of the major areas in focus
regulatory challenges especially from the us fda has impacted many players including some who are major players in the us market resulting in lower
growth in the last two years this has been further complicated by the debate on drug pricing which has impacted the sentiment around the industry

economic growth and increase in disposable income in india has resulted in greater affordability and consumption of healthcare services in general
particularly generic medicines there is a growing burden on account of noncommunicable diseases and some infectious diseases in india lifestyle
diseases such as diabetes cardiovascular disease and stroke in india have become a public health challenge who estimates that these diseases with
mostly preventable risk factors account for 60 of all deaths and significant morbidity in india this should continue to increase the per capita consumption
of medicines in the country

however access to and quality of healthcare services is not equal in the country resulting in inequitable outcomes in some instances it has led to
catastrophic expenditures for families and has been one of the major contributors to families discontinuing treatment after being thrust into poverty both
central and state governments in india are taking steps to address the problem the recent national health policy nhp 2017 lays out a plan towards
achieving universal health coverage in india the policy aims at achieving universal health coverage and delivering quality health care services to all at
affordable cost it recommends prioritizing the role of the government in shaping health systems in all its dimensions the roadmap of the nhp is predicated
on public spending 25 of gdp in a phased manner and provisioning of a public healthcare system that is comprehensive integrated and accessible to
all it seeks to promote quality of care focus on emerging diseases and investment in promotive and preventive healthcare the policy is patient centric and
quality driven and addresses health security and promotes make in india for drugs and devices with private players as strategic partners

the cro space
contract research organizations cros provide support to the pharmaceutical biotechnology and related industries through outsourced research and
development services that span drug discovery preclinical research clinical research clinical trial management commercialization and pharmacovigilance

as the life science industry has evolved and matured companies are dedicating their resources and efforts to particular areas of the value chain and have
developed outsourcing relationships to perform other functions incremental outsourcing of additional processes to qualified contract research organizations
cros has brought cost efficiency to the process improved quality control and speed to market with increased spending on drug development the
industry is now outsourcing an increasing quantum of services to competitive vendors strong underlying pharmaceutical demand coupled with increasing
complexity and regulatory burden have created a favourable environment for cros it has helped to change the dynamics between the pharmaceutical
biotechnology industry and the cro from purely a client  vendor relationship to that of strategic partnership companies are trying to consolidate and
simplify their supply chains by concentrating sourcing among a select number of multiservice vendors

there is increased outsourcing of manufacturing services to cros to moderate manufacturing costs by outsourcing to lowcost global destinations like
india india has emerged as one of the leading economical quality pharmaceutical manufacturing hub for a number of global players outsourcing to
india offers significant benefits over mature pharmaceutical hubs in north america and europe india has become increasingly important in the global
pharmaceutical supply chain and hence incentivising the engagement of indian pharmaceutical players in research and related manufacture has resulted in
contract research and manufacturing services crams emerging as one of the fastest growing segments in the country

opportunities and prospects

the outsourcing of cro discovery services in 2016 is estimated at usd 178 bn this estimate exclude clinical research and contract manufacturing
outsourcing this number is estimated to grow to usd 29 bn by 2022 source iq4i report with increased outsourcing to efficient and low cost cro hubs
especially in india and china compared to the european and american counterparts asiapacific is therefore expected to be the fastest growing region in

company review
biocon utilises its core capabilities in fermentation technology and high end rd skills for manufacturing biopharmaceuticals across small molecule apis
and large molecule biologics the company currently has front end presence in india and uae where it sells novel and branded small molecule biologic
products through its field force it also addresses its customers rd requirements through various services provided through its publically listed research
services arm syngene international the company is organized into the following reporting segments

a    small molecule apis  generic formulations

b    biologics  biosimilars insulins mabs  other biologics  novel biologics

c    branded formulations currently india  uae

d    research services syngene

a detailed analysis of our business segments is indicated hereunder

small molecule segment apis and generic formulations

the small molecule segment comprises apis as well generic formulations revenues in this segment are currently derived from sale of api to third parties this
segment has had a successful track record of regulatory audits both by developed as well as the emerging market regulators in this segment we leverage our
strengths in manufacturing products that have high degree of complexity in most cases using fermentation as the preferred route these include production of
various statin api various immunosuppressant api and api contract manufacturing for innovators in the fermentation space we are working towards entering
the oncology space in the very near future through investments towards enhancing our development and manufacturing capabilities

key api product portfolio 

a    statin basket simvastatin pravastatin atorvastatin rosuvastatin  fluvastatin
b    immunosuppressant basket tacrolimus sirolimus everolimus mycophenolate mofetil mmf  mycophenolate sodium mpa
c    other key products orlistat fidaxomicin

we are leading suppliers of the above products to leading companies and estimate that our global market share ranges from 15 to as high as 50 for
the top10 molecules in our api portfolio most of these products are manufactured via fermentation process a core strength of biocon we have been
supplying our customers with high quality products over many years which have resulted in multiyear associations with our clients enabling high global
market shares for biocon in the api space

to diversify and address the needs of the changing landscape given the limited number of fermentation based api available as a generic opportunity
we decided to move up the value chain and ventured into generic formulations focusing on the following diseases segments  metabolics oncology
immunology and auto immune indications our strategy is to have a vertically integrated business model and currently have a nascent pipeline of products
with a couple of approved dossiers for the us and eu markets we are working on a niche portfolio of products which are complex and expected to have
limited competition we aim to leverage our strengths acquired in characterization and manufacturing of complex proteins to this business hence we would
be targeting select opportunities that would fit our selection criteria and where we can be vertically integrated we believe this could add value to our api
business and help sustain long term growth in this segment

the work on the greenfield generic oral solid dosage facility which would be a key component of our vertical integration efforts is in full swing the facility
is expected to be commissioned in fy18 we propose to use this facility primarily for potent products

currently this segment of our business contributes to significant revenues 40 in fy17 and profits for the company cash generated from this business
has helped fund our early biosimilar foray into global markets operationally fy17 has been a good year for the small molecules segment with a growth of
12 as compared to fy16 this growth was driven to a large extent by supplies of rosuvastatin api to our customers targeting the us generics market on
the generic formulations side we received approval for our rosuvastatin calcium anda from the usfda eu approval for the same was received in fy16

biologics segment biosimilars  novel biologics

biocon has been ahead of the curve in india by focussing early on innovation especially in the area of biologic drugs we have made significant investments
in building capability in science and technology courtesy to a highly talented team of scientists novel process engineering of drug substance and drug
product predictive toxicology adaptive clinical trial designs and data analytics the outcome of these efforts has been innovative products which include
antibodies like biomabegfr nimotuzumab for treatment of head and neck cancer and alzumab itolizumab for treating psoriasis in addition these
capabilities have also enabled approval of canmab an affordable trastuzumab biosimilar for treating her2 breast cancer very large scale development
of insulins insugen and insulin analogs basalog and device systems insupen made available to the global patient population

biocons biologics segment comprises of its pipeline of 10 biosimilar molecules that includes human insulininsulin analogues monoclonal antibodies and
other biologics apart from a pipeline of novel biologic products the focus in this segment is on drugs that help patients fight diabetes cancer and auto
immune diseases and inflammation

in the future the segment has been identified by management as a significant growth driver for the company being an early starter among its peers in india
and now having experience of developing manufacturing and selling some of these products in many markets globally the company is confident of making
its mark at the global scene once it enters the developed markets with its portfolio of products

in the year under review we built upon the success in fy16 with multiple clinical and regulatory milestones being met by this business segment segment
revenues grew 43 over fy16 to 5793 mn

biosimilars
biocon possesses one of the largest global biosimilars portfolios spanning human insulininsulin analogues monoclonal antibodies and other biologics with
an addressable market size of usd 61 bn of the 10 disclosed molecules in our pipeline nine molecules are being developed in partnership with mylan
a global generics major the strategic partnership between biocon and mylan represents biocons strength in biologics development and manufacturing as
well as mylans regulatory and commercial strengths globally

we received the first developed market approval for our insulin glargine product in japan in partnership with fujifilm pharma in fy16 our partner fujifilm
pharma ffp launched the product in japan on 15th july 2016 the feedback for our product has been very positive with our device being appreciated for
the ease of use the market for insulin glargine in japan is small if compared with the percentage of insulin glargine sales globally however the success of
getting the product approved in the first pass and now selling the product in the japanese market reinforces our internal belief that we are well positioned
to address the insulin glargine opportunity in other developed markets through our partnership with mylan

our proposed biosimilar trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim were accepted and are under review by the united states food  drugs administration usfda and the
europeans medicines agency ema ema is also reviewing our proposed biosimilar insulin glargine which is targeted at the eu market we expect to receive
marketing approval decisions for some of these molecules in the second half of fy18 while the filing for generic insulin glargine with the usfda is expected
in early fy18 our proposed biosimilar adalimumab for which the global clinical trial is now complete

we completed the emerging market targeted indian clinical trial for our proposed biosimilar bevacizumab and filed for marketing authorization with the
indian health regulator in fy17 the global phase 3 trial for bevacizumab was also initiated in late fy17
work on our recombinant human insulin rhi product targeted at the us market and two other global programs for insulin analogs insulin aspart insulin

biocon achieved the significant commercialization milestone of its first overseas facility in malaysia when our subsidiary biocon sdn bhd malaysia was
awarded a myr 300 million  4600 million three year contract for supplying rhi cartridges and reusable insulin pens under the malaysian governments
offtake agreement ota initiative from its large scale biopharmaceutical facility in johor malaysia the ota seeks to encourage local manufacturing of new
pharmaceutical products thus lowering the countrys reliance on imports and also enhancing the exports potential biocons rhi is malaysias first locally
manufactured biosimilar biologic product approved by the national pharmaceutical regulatory authority npra malaysia for commercial sales in the country

apart from the japanese and malaysia milestone under our insulins portfolio we saw an increase in licensing income in fy17 the income is to a great
extent a result of our successful partnership outcomes for trastuzumab in several of the large emerging markets once our local partners receive regulatory
approvals in their markets we expect it would result in a more meaningfully contribution from trastuzumab sales in this segment in fy18 and beyond from
some larger emerging markets given the high unmet need for this drug we see biosimilar trastuzumab as a very meaningful opportunity not only in the
developed markets but also in emerging markets from a developed markets stand point our partner mylan entered into a settlement agreement with
genentech and la hoffman roche related to intellectual property around trastuzumab this removes legal uncertainties related to the timing of launch of
this product in various markets around the world

the ability to address market demand by creating capacity reducing cost and increasing operational efficiency will be a key differentiator for the success of
our biosimilar forays in developed as well as emerging markets biocon has been building manufacturing capacity in a phased manner to fulfil market demand
for its portfolio products our malaysia insulins plant started commercial operation in fy17 while we plan to further augment our biologics manufacturing
capacity for monoclonal antibodies in line with the launch and ramp up of supplies of our products across the globe we expect to break ground on a new
monoclonal antibody facility in bengaluru in fy18 this facility will be built in two phases over a period of three to four years an expansion of our malaysian
insulin plant malaysia phase 2 will also be considered in due course in line with movement of portfolio of molecules insulin lispro insulin aspart in the
clinic and regulatory and commercial outcomes for our insulin glargine product in the eu and us markets

the company continues to work towards augmenting its portfolio with more biosimilar candidates under development names undisclosed where market
formation is expected in the next decade current efforts are focused on executing on our partnered pipeline which is expected to be commercialized over
the next few years

     sustainable sourcing are as below

     a     sourcing  vendor consolidation

            i     we believe that for strategic suppliers in the interest of business its best to have minimum touchpoints at multiple levels this helps
                   in driving a common corporate message across without it having to fly through multiple channels towards this sourcing strategies have
                   been consolidated for all plants at our bengaluru headquarters we strive to achieve a balance between the benefits of centralization
                   and decentralization

            ii    consolidating vendors also helps us in keeping transactions to a minimum thereby minimizing operational loads consolidating
                   requirements also helps in better planning and effective negotiations

                   which includes insulins we believe this has contributed significantly to our environment friendly initiatives apart from being a social
                   cause in itself

            ii    sourcing team at biocon focus on use of green solvents which are nonpetrochemicals based eg ethanol for majority of our business
                   units thereby reducing the dependency on nonrenewable forms of energy

            iii   deployment of professional and regulatory compliant logistics providers helps in consolidating solvents deliveries which further helps
                   in achieving reduction in fuel cost per unit of solvent consumed at biocon

     c     periodic vendor evaluation

                   include otif ontime infull deliveries  number of quality complaints

            ii    we conduct monthly reviews for each supply chain function to address issues with suppliers

            iii   we have also entrusted vendor evaluation to 3rd party international agencies like dun  bradstreet

     work

     if yes what steps have been taken to improve their capacity and capability of local and small vendors

14   measurement of fair values
      a number of the companys accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for both financial and nonfinancial assets
      and liabilities
      fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows
            level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
            level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly ie as prices or
             indirectly ie derived from prices
            level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs
      when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability the company uses observable market data as far as possible if the inputs used to measure the
      fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in
      the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement
      the company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred
      further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes
            note 31               share based payment arrangements
            note 4                investment property and
            note 2a and 39      financial instruments

a    financial instruments
      i     recognition and initial measurement
             trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated all other financial assets and financial liabilities
             are initially recognised when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument
             a financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus for an item not at fair value through profit and loss fvtpl transaction
             costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue
      ii    classification and subsequent measurement
             financial assets
             on initial recognition a financial asset is classified as measured at
                   amortised cost
                   fvoci  debt investment
                   fvoci  equity investment or
                   fvtpl
             financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition except if and in the period the company changes its business model
             for managing financial assets
             a financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl
                   the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and
                   the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest
                    on the principal amount outstanding
             a debt investment is measured at fvoci if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl
                   the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial
                    assets and
                   the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest
                    on the principal amount outstanding
             on initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading the company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in
             the investments fair value in oci designated as fvoci  equity investment this election is made on an investment by investment basis
             all financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or fvoci as described above are measured at fvtpl this includes all derivative
             financial assets on initial recognition the company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be
             measured at amortised cost or at fvoci as at fvtpl if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise
             arise

iii   derecognition
       financial assets
       the company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the
       rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset
       are transferred or in which the company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain
       control of the financial asset
       if the company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet but retains either all or substantially all of
       the risks and rewards of the transferred assets the transferred assets are not derecognised
       financial liabilities
       the company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire
       the company also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows under the modified terms are substantially
       different in this case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value the difference between the carrying
       amount of the financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability with modified terms is recognised in statement of profit and loss
iv    offsetting
       financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when and only when the company
       currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and
       settle the liability simultaneously
v     derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
       the company holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures embedded derivatives are
       separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met
       derivatives are initially measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition derivatives are measured at fair value and changes therein are
       generally recognised in statement of profit and loss
       the company designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable
       forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates
       at inception of designated hedging relationships the company documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the
       hedge the company also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument including whether the
       changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other
       cash flow hedges
       when a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is
       recognised in oci and accumulated in other equity under effective portion of cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair
       value of the derivative that is recognised in oci is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item determined on a present
       value basis from inception of the hedge any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in
       statement of profit and loss
       if a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold expires is terminated or is exercised then hedge
       accounting is discontinued prospectively when hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued the amount that has been accumulated


                                                                                                                             financial report            179

             in other equity remains there until for a hedge of a transaction resulting in recognition of a nonfinancial item it is included in the nonfinancial
             items cost on its initial recognition or for other cash flow hedges it is reclassified to profit and loss in the same period or periods as the hedged
             expected future cash flows affect profit and loss
             if the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately
             reclassified to statement of profit and loss

             attributable to bringing the item to working condition for its intended use and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and
             restoring the site on which it is located
             if significant parts of an item of property plant and equipment have different useful lives then they are accounted for as separate items major
             components of property plant and equipment
             any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised in statement of profit and loss
             subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the
             company
     ii     depreciation
             depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property plant and equipment less their estimated residual values over their estimated useful
             lives using the straightline method assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful
             lives unless it is reasonably certain that the company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term freehold land is not depreciated
             the estimated useful lives of items of property plant and equipment for the current and comparative periods are as follows

              asset                                                                                     management estimate          useful life as per schedule ii

             depreciation method useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial yearend and adjusted if appropriate based on technical
             evaluation and consequent advice the management believes that its estimates of useful lives as given above best represent the period over
             which management expects to use these assets
             depreciation on additions disposals is provided on a prorata basis ie from upto the date on which asset is ready for use disposed of
c   intangible assets
     internally generated research and development
     expenditure on research activities is recognised in statement of profit and loss as incurred
     development expenditure is capitalised as part of the cost of the resulting intangible asset only if the expenditure can be measured reliably the
     product or process is technically and commercially feasible future economic benefits are probable and the company intends to and has sufficient

     resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset otherwise it is recognised in statement of profit and loss as incurred subsequent to
     initial recognition the asset is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses
     others
     other intangible assets are initially measured at cost subsequently such intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and
     any accumulated impairment losses
     i    subsequent expenditure
           subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates all
           other expenditure including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in statement of profit and loss as incurred
     ii   amortisation
           goodwill is not amortised and is tested for impairment annually
           other intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life as follows
                  computer software                                                                       35 years

           amortisation method useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted if appropriate
d   investment property
     investment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both but not for sale in the ordinary course
     of business use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes upon initial recognition an investment property
     is measured at cost subsequent to initial recognition investment property is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
     impairment losses if any
     based on technical evaluation and consequent advice the management believes a period of 25 years as representing the best estimate of the period
     over which investment properties which are quite similar are expected to be used accordingly the company depreciates investment properties over
     a period of 25 years on a straightline basis the useful life estimate of 25 years is different from the indicative useful life of relevant type of buildings
     mentioned in part c of schedule ii to the act ie 30 years
     any gain or loss on disposal of an investment property is recognised in statement of profit and loss
e   business combination
     in accordance with ind as 103 business combinations the company accounts for business combinations after acquisition date using the acquisition
     method when control is transferred to the company see note 42 the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given equity
     instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange the cost of acquisition also includes the fair value of any contingent
     consideration and deferred consideration if any any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised
     in oci and accumulated in equity as capital reserve if there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as
     resulting in a bargain purchase otherwise the gain is recognised directly in equity as capital reserve transaction costs are expensed as incurred
f   inventories
     inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value the cost of inventories is based on the firstin firstout formula and includes
     expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location
     and condition in the case of manufactured inventories and workinprogress cost includes an appropriate share of fixed production overheads based
     on normal operating capacity
     net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses the
     net realisable value of workinprogress is determined with reference to the selling prices of related finished products
     raw materials components and other supplies held for use in the production of finished products are not written down below cost except in cases
     where material prices have declined and it is estimated that the cost of the finished products will exceed their net realisable value
     the comparison of cost and net realisable value is made on an itembyitem basis
g   impairment
     i    impairment of financial assets
           in accordance with ind as 109 the company applies expected credit loss ecl model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss
           on following
                  financial assets measured at amortised cost and
                  financial assets measured at fvoci debt investments
           loss allowance for trade receivables with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses
           for all other financial assets ecl are measured at an amount equal to the 12month ecl unless there has been a significant increase in credit
           risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at lifetime ecl
           loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from gross carrying amount of the assets for debt securities at
           fvoci the loss allowance is charged to statement of profit and loss and is recognised in oci




                                                                                                                                financial report            181

     ii     impairment of nonfinancial assets
             the company assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable if any such
             indication exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or
             cgu exceeds its estimated recoverable amount in the statement of profit and loss
             goodwill is tested annually for impairment for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to
             cgus or groups of cgus that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination
             the companys nonfinancial assets inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any
             indication of impairment if any such indication exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated for impairment testing assets that
             do not generate independent cash inflows are grouped together into cashgenerating units cgus each cgu represents the smallest group of
             assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cgus
             impairment loss recognised in respect of a cgu is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cgu and then
             to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets of the cgu or groups of cgus on a pro rata basis
             an impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not subsequently reversed in respect of other assets for which impairment loss has been recognised
             in prior periods the company reviews at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the loss has decreased or no longer exists
             an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount such a reversal is made
             only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation
             or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised
h   employee benefits
     i      gratuity
             the company provides for gratuity a defined benefit plan the gratuity plan covering the eligible employees of the company the gratuity
             plan provides a lumpsum payment to vested employees at retirement death incapacitation or termination of employment of an amount
             based on the respective employees salary and the tenure of the employment with the company
             liability with regard to the gratuity plan are determined by actuarial valuation performed by an independent actuary at each balance sheet date using
             the projected unit credit method the defined benefit plan is administered by a trust formed for this purpose through the company gratuity scheme
             the company recognises the net obligation of a defined benefit plan as a liability in its balance sheet gains or losses through remeasurement of
             the net defined benefit liability are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit and loss in the subsequent periods
             the actual return of the portfolio of plan assets in excess of the yields computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit
             obligation is recognised in other comprehensive income the effect of any plan amendments are recognised in the statement of profit and loss
     ii     provident fund
             eligible employees of the company receive benefits from provident fund which is a defined contribution plan both the eligible employees
             and the company make monthly contributions to the government administered provident fund scheme equal to a specified percentage of the
             eligible employees salary amounts collected under the provident fund plan are deposited with in a government administered provident fund
             the company has no further obligation to the plan beyond its monthly contributions
     iii    compensated absences
             the company has a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and nonaccumulating in nature the expected cost of
             accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by an independent actuary at each balance sheet date
             using the projected unit credit method on the additional amount expected to be paidavailed as a result of the unused entitlement that has
             accumulated at the balance sheet date expense on nonaccumulating compensated absences is recognised is the period in which the absences
             occur
     iv     sharebased compensation
             the grant date fair value of equity settled sharebased payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense with a
             corresponding increase in equity over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards the amount recognised
             as expense is based on the estimate of the number of awards for which the related service and nonmarket vesting conditions are expected
             to be met such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and
             nonmarket vesting conditions at the vesting date
i   provisions other than for employee benefits
     a provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and
     it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation provisions are determined by discounting the expected
     future cash flows representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date at a pre
     tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability the unwinding of the discount is
     recognised as finance cost expected future operating losses are not provided for
     onerous contracts
     a contract is considered to be onerous when the expected economic benefits to be derived by the company from the contract are lower than the
     unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract the provision for an onerous contract is measured at the present value of the lower of
     the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract before such a provision is made the company
     recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract
j   revenue
     i      sale of goods
             revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer recovery of the consideration
             is probable the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimate reliably there is no continuing management involvement with

                                                                                                                                             biocon limited



            the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably the timing of transfers of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual
            terms of sale revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable
            net of returns sales tax and applicable trade discounts and allowances
     ii    milestone payments and out licensing arrangements
            the company enters into certain dossier sales licensing and supply arrangements that in certain instances include certain performance
            obligations based on an evaluation of whether or not these obligations are inconsequential or perfunctory we recognise or defer the upfront
            payments received under these arrangements the deferred revenue is recognised in the standalone statement of operations in the period in
            which we complete our remaining performance obligations
            these arrangements typically also consist of subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms
            prescribed in the agreement milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues
            either on achievement of such milestones if the milestones are considered substantive or over the period we have continuing performance
            obligations if the milestones are not considered substantive if milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments the
            milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid
     iii   sales return allowances
            the company accounts for sales return by recording an allowance for sales return concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a
            product sale the allowance is based on companys estimate of expected sales returns the estimate of sales return is determined primarily by
            the companys historical experience in the markets in which the company operates
     iv    dividends
            dividend is recognised when the companys right to receive the payment is established which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend
     v     rental income
            rental income from investment property is recognised in statement of profit and loss on a straightline basis over the term of the lease except
            where the rentals are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part
            of the total rental income over the term of the lease
     vi    contribution received from customerscodevelopment partners towards plant and equipment
            contributions received from customerscodevelopment partners towards items of property plant and equipment which require an obligation to
            supply goods to the customer in the future are recognised as a credit to deferred revenue the contribution received is recognised as revenue from
            operations over the useful life of the assets the company capitalises the gross cost of these assets as the company controls these assets
k   government grants
     the company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with and
     the grants will be received government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related asset
     grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense
l   income taxes
     income tax comprises current and deferred income tax income tax expense is recognised in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that
     it relates to an item recognised directly in equity in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income current income tax for current year
     and prior periods is recognised at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities using the tax rates and laws that have been
     enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date
     deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
     carrying amounts in the financial statements except when
           taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill
           temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects
            neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of transaction
           temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the company is able to
            control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future
     deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be
     realised
     deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
     sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled
     the effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognised as income or expense in the period that includes the
     enactment or substantive enactment date a deferred income tax assets is recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable income will
     be available against which the deductible temporary timing differences and tax losses can be utilised the company offsets incometax assets and
     liabilities where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise
     the asset and settle the liability simultaneously
m   borrowing cost
     borrowing costs are interest and other costs including exchange differences relating to foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are
     regarded as an adjustment to interest costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition
     or construction of an asset which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of
     that asset other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred
n   earnings per share
     basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period adjusted for treasury shares
     held diluted earnings per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of equity and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding during the
     period using the treasury stock method for options and warrants except where the results would be antidilutive

        sensitivity of significant actuarial assumptions is computed by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation of defined benefit obligation
        by one percentage keeping all other actuarial assumptions constant although the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash
        flows expected under the plan it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumption shown

subject to interest rate risk as defined under ind as 107 since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of change in
market interest rates

company

                                                                                                                                financial report            227

                                         magnitude of an outflow of resources

     f    measurement of fair values

           a number of the groups accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for both financial and nonfinancial assets
           and liabilities

           fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows

                 level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

                 level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly ie as prices or
                  indirectly ie derived from prices

                 level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs

           when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability the group uses observable market data as far as possible if the inputs used to measure
           the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy then the fair value measurement is categorised in its
           entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement

           the group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has
           occurred

           further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes

                 note 30                       sharebased payment arrangements

2   significant accounting policies
     a    basis of consolidation

           i     subsidiaries

                  subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group the group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its
                  involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity the financial statements of subsidiaries
                  are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases

                  the financial statements of the group are consolidated on linebyline basis intragroup transactions balances and any unrealised gains
                  arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated unrealised losses are eliminated but only to the extent that there is no evidence
                  of impairment all temporary differences that arise from the elimination of profits and losses resulting from intragroup transactions are
                  recognised as per ind as 12 income taxes

                  for the purpose of preparing these consolidated financial statements the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where
                  necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the company

                  noncontrolling interests nci

                  nci are measured at their proportionate share of the acquirees net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition

                  changes in the groups equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions

           ii    loss of control

                  when the group loses control over a subsidiary it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and any related nci and other
                  components of equity any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost any resulting
                  gain or loss is recognised in statement of profit and loss

           iii   associates and joint arrangements equity accounted investees

                  the groups interests in equity accounted investees comprise interests in associates and a joint venture

                  an associate is an entity in which the group has significant influence but not control or joint control over the financial and operating
                  policies a joint venture is an arrangement in which the group has joint control and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement rather
                  than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities

                  interests in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method they are initially recognised at cost which includes
                  transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition the consolidated financial statements include the groups share of profit or loss and
                  oci of equity accounted investees until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases

           of the transactions or an average rate if the average rate approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction

           monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the
           reporting date nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional
           currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are measured based on
           historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction exchange differences are recognised
           in statement of profit and loss except exchange differences arising from the translation of the qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent
           that the hedges are effective which are recognised in oci

           income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into inr at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or an average
           rate if the average rate approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction

           foreign currency translation differences are recognised in oci and accumulated in equity as exchange differences on translating the
           financial statements of a foreign operation except to the extent that the exchange differences are allocated to nci

c   financial instruments

     i    recognition and initial measurement

           trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated all other financial assets and financial
           liabilities are initially recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument

           a financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus for an item not at fair value through profit and loss fvtpl
           transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue

     ii   classification and subsequent measurement

           financial assets

           on initial recognition a financial asset is classified as measured at

            amortised cost

            fvoci  debt investment

            fvoci  equity investment or

            fvtpl

           financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition except if and in the period the group changes its business
           model for managing financial assets

           a financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl

            the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and

            the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest
             on the principal amount outstanding

           a debt investment is measured at fvoci if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl

            the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial
             assets and

            the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest
             on the principal amount outstanding

           on initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading the group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes
           in the investments fair value in oci designated as fvoci  equity investment this election is made on an investment by investment
           basis

           all financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or fvoci as described above are measured at fvtpl this includes
           all derivative financial assets on initial recognition the group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the
           requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at fvoci as at fvtpl if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting
           mismatch that would otherwise arise



                                                                                                                         financial report            229

                                                          the amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses interest income foreign exchange gains

                                                          losses accumulated in oci are reclassified to statement of profit and loss
                 equity investments at fvoci              these assets are subsequently measured at fair value dividends are recognised as income in
                                                          statement of profit and loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost

                financial liabilities classification subsequent measurement and gains and losses

                financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or fvtpl a financial liability is classified as at fvtpl if it is classified as
                held for trading or it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition financial liabilities at fvtpl are measured at fair
                value and net gains and losses including any interest expense are recognised in statement of profit and loss other financial liabilities
                are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method interest expense and foreign exchange gains and
                losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in statement of profit and loss

         iii   derecognition of financial instruments

                financial assets

                the group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the
                financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under ind as 109 a financial liability or a part of financial liability is de
                recognised from the groups balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged cancelled or expires

                financial liabilities

                the group derecognises a financial liabilities when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire

                the group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows under the modified terms are
                substantially different in this case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value the difference
                between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability with modified terms is recognised in
                statement of profit and loss

         iv    derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

                the group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures embedded derivatives are
                separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met

                derivatives are initially measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition derivatives are measured at fair value and changes
                therein are generally recognised in statement of profit and loss

                the group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable
                forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates

                at inception of designated hedging relationships the group documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the
                hedge the group also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument including whether
                the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other

                cash flow hedges

                when a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is
                recognised in oci and accumulated in other equity under effective portion of cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the
                fair value of the derivative that is recognised in oci is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item determined on
                a present value basis from inception of the hedge any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised
                immediately in statement of profit and loss

                if a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold expires is terminated or is exercised then
                hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued the amount that has been
                accumulated in other equity remains there until for a hedge of a transaction resulting in recognition of a nonfinancial item it is included
                in the nonfinancial items cost on its initial recognition or for other cash flow hedges it is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period
                or periods as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss

             if the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are
             immediately reclassified to profit or loss

     v      treasury shares

             the group has created an employee welfare trust ewt for providing sharebased payment to its employees own equity instruments
             that are reacquired treasury shares are recognised at cost and deducted from equity when the treasury shares are issued to the
             employees by ewt the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resultant gain loss is transferred to from
             securities premium

     vi     offsetting

             financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when and only when the group
             currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset
             and settle the liability simultaneously

     vii    cash and cash equivalents

             cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and shortterm deposits with an original maturity
             of three months or less which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value for the purpose of the statement of cash flows
             cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and shortterm deposits as defined above net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are
             considered an integral part of the groups cash management

     viii   cash dividend to equity holders

             the group recognises a liability to make cash distribution to equity holders when the distribution is authorised and the distribution
             is no longer at the discretion of the group as per the corporate laws in india a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the
             shareholders a corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity interim dividends are recorded as a liability on the date of
             declaration by the companys board of directors

d   property plant and equipment

     i      recognition and measurement

             items of property plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses if any
             the cost of a selfconstructed item of property plant and equipment comprises the cost of materials and direct labour any other costs
             directly attributable to bringing the item to working condition for its intended use and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the
             item and restoring the site on which it is located

             if significant parts of an item of property plant and equipment have different useful lives then they are accounted for as separate items
             major components of property plant and equipment

             any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised in statement of profit and loss

             subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow
             to the group

     ii     depreciation

             depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property plant and equipment less their estimated residual values over their estimated
             useful lives using the straightline method assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and
             their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term freehold land is not
             depreciated

             the estimated useful lives of items of property plant and equipment for the current and comparative periods are as follows

             asset                                                                                 management estimate         useful life as per

             depreciation method useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial yearend and adjusted if appropriate based on
             technical evaluation and consequent advice the management believes that its estimates of useful lives as given above best represent
             the period over which management expects to use these assets

             depreciation on additions disposals is provided on a prorata basis ie from upto the date on which asset is ready for use disposed of



                                                                                                                          financial report           231

    e    goodwill and other intangible assets

          i     goodwill

                 for measurement of goodwill that arises on a business combination refer note 37 subsequent measurement is at cost less any
                 accumulated impairment losses

          ii    other intangible assets

                 internally generated research and development

                 expenditure on research activities is recognised in statement of profit and loss as incurred

                 development expenditure is capitalised as part of the cost of the resulting intangible asset only if the expenditure can be measured reliably
                 the product or process is technically and commercially feasible future economic benefits are probable and the group intends to and has
                 sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset otherwise it is recognised in statement of profit and loss as incurred
                 subsequent to initial recognition the asset is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses

                 others

                 other intangible assets are initially measured at cost subsequently such intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated
                 amortization and any accumulated impairment losses

          iii   subsequent expenditure

                 subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it
                 relates all other expenditure including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in statement of profit
                 and loss as incurred

          iv    amortisation

                 goodwill is not amortised and is tested for impairment annually

                 other intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life as follows

                       computer software                                  35 years

                       customer related intangibles                       5 years

                 amortisation method useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted if appropriate

    f    investment property

          investment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both but not for sale in the ordinary course of
          business use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes upon initial recognition an investment property
          is measured at cost subsequent to initial recognition investment property is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
          impairment losses if any

          based on technical evaluation and consequent advice the management believes a period of 25 years as representing the best estimate of
          the period over which investment properties which are quite similar are expected to be used accordingly the group depreciates investment
          properties over a period of 25 years on a straightline basis the useful life estimate of 25 years is different from the indicative useful life of
          relevant type of buildings mentioned in part c of schedule ii to the act ie 30 years

          any gain or loss on disposal of an investment property is recognised in statement of profit and loss

    g    business combination

          in accordance with ind as 103 business combinations the group accounts for business combinations after acquisition date using the
          acquisition method when control is transferred to the company see note 37 the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the
          assets given equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange the cost of acquisition also includes the fair
          value of any contingent consideration and deferred consideration if any any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment any gain
          on a bargain purchase is recognised in oci and accumulated in equity as capital reserve if there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons
          for classifying the business combination as resulting in a bargain purchase otherwise the gain is recognised directly in equity as capital reserve
          transaction costs are expensed as incurred

    h    inventories

          inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value the cost of inventories is based on the firstin firstout formula and
          includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their
          present location and condition in the case of manufactured inventories and workinprogress cost includes an appropriate share of fixed
          production overheads based on normal operating capacity

          net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling
          expenses the net realisable value of workinprogress is determined with reference to the selling prices of related finished products

          raw materials components and other supplies held for use in the production of finished products are not written down below cost except in
          cases where material prices have declined and it is estimated that the cost of the finished products will exceed their net realisable value

                                                                                                              biocon limited  subsidiaries



     the comparison of cost and net realisable value is made on an itembyitem basis

i   impairment

     i     impairment of financial assets

            in accordance with ind as 109 the group applies expected credit loss ecl model for measurement and recognition of impairment
            loss on following

             financial assets measured at amortised cost and

             financial assets measured at fvoci debt investments

            loss allowance for trade receivables with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit
            losses for all other financial assets ecl are measured at an amount equal to the 12month ecl unless there has been a significant
            increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at lifetime ecl

            loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from gross carrying amount of the assets for debt securities
            at fvoci the loss allowance is charged to statement of profit and loss and is recognised in oci

     ii    impairment of nonfinancial assets

            the group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable if any such
            indication exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an
            asset or cgu exceeds its estimated recoverable amount in the statement of profit and loss

            goodwill is tested annually for impairment for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill arising from a business combination is
            allocated to cgus or groups of cgus that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination

            the groups nonfinancial assets inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there
            is any indication of impairment if any such indication exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated for impairment testing
            assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are grouped together into cashgenerating units cgus each cgu represents the
            smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cgus

            impairment loss recognised in respect of a cgu is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cgu and
            then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets of the cgu or group of cgus on a pro rata basis

            an impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not subsequently reversed in respect of other assets for which impairment loss has been
            recognised in prior periods the group reviews at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the loss has decreased or no
            longer exists an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount
            such a reversal is made only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
            determined net of depreciation or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised

j   employee benefits

     i     gratuity

            the group provides for gratuity a defined benefit plan the gratuity plan covering the eligible employees of the company and its indian
            subsidiaries the gratuity plan provides a lumpsum payment to vested employees at retirement death incapacitation or termination of
            employment of an amount based on the respective employees salary and the tenure of the employment with the group

            liability with regard to the gratuity plan are determined by actuarial valuation performed by an independent actuary at each balance
            sheet date using the projected unit credit method the defined benefit plan is administered by a trust formed for this purpose through
            the group gratuity scheme

            the group recognises the net obligation of a defined benefit plan as a liability in its balance sheet gains or losses through re
            measurement of the net defined benefit liability are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit and loss
            in the subsequent periods the actual return of the portfolio of plan assets in excess of the yields computed by applying the discount
            rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is recognised in other comprehensive income the effect of any plan amendments
            are recognised in the statement of profit and loss

     ii    provident fund

            eligible employees of the company and its indian subsidiaries receive benefits from provident fund which is a defined contribution
            plan both the eligible employees and the respective companies make monthly contributions to the government administered provident
            fund scheme equal to a specified percentage of the eligible employees salary amounts collected under the provident fund plan are
            deposited with in a government administered provident fund the companies have no further obligation to the plan beyond its monthly
            contributions

     iii   compensated absences

            the group has a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and nonaccumulating in nature the expected cost of
            accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by an independent actuary at each balance sheet
            date using the projected unit credit method on the additional amount expected to be paidavailed as a result of the unused entitlement
            that has accumulated at the balance sheet date expense on nonaccumulating compensated absences is recognised is the period in
            which the absences occur



                                                                                                                      financial report           233

          iv    sharebased compensation

                 the grant date fair value of equity settled sharebased payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense
                 with a corresponding increase in equity over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards the amount
                 recognised as expense is based on the estimate of the number of awards for which the related service and nonmarket vesting conditions
                 are expected to be met such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the
                 related service and nonmarket vesting conditions at the vesting date

    k    provisions other than for employee benefits

          a provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably
          and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation provisions are determined by discounting the
          expected future cash flows representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet
          date at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability the unwinding
          of the discount is recognised as finance cost expected future operating losses are not provided for

          onerous contracts

          a contract is considered to be onerous when the expected economic benefits to be derived by the group from the contract are lower than the
          unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract the provision for an onerous contract is measured at the present value of the
          lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract before such a provision is
          made the group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract

    l    revenue

          i     sale of goods

                 revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer recovery of the
                 consideration is probable the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimate reliably there is no continuing management
                 involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably the timing of transfers of risks and rewards varies
                 depending on the individual terms of sale revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is measured at the fair value of the
                 consideration received or receivable net of returns sales tax and applicable trade discounts and allowances

          ii    milestone payments and out licensing arrangements

                 the company enters into certain dossier sales licensing and supply arrangements that in certain instances include certain performance
                 obligations based on an evaluation of whether or not these obligations are inconsequential or perfunctory we recognise or defer the
                 upfront payments received under these arrangements the deferred revenue is recognised in the consolidated statement of operations
                 in the period in which we complete our remaining performance obligations

                 these arrangements typically also consist of subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the
                 terms prescribed in the agreement milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognized as
                 revenues either on achievement of such milestones if the milestones are considered substantive or over the period we have continuing
                 performance obligations if the milestones are not considered substantive if milestone payments are creditable against future royalty
                 payments the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid

          iii   contract research and manufacturing services income

                 in respect of contracts involving research services in case of time and materials contracts contract research fee are recognised as
                 services are rendered in accordance with the terms of the contracts revenues relating to fixed price contracts are recognised based
                 on the percentage of completion method determined based on efforts expended as a proportion to total estimated efforts the group
                 monitors estimates of total contract revenue and cost on a routine basis throughout the contract period the cumulative impact of any
                 change in estimates of the contract revenue or costs is reflected in the period in which the changes become known in the event that a
                 loss is anticipated on a particular contract provision is made for the estimated loss

                 in respect of contracts involving sale of compounds arising out of contract research services for which separate invoices are raised
                 revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the compounds have passed to the buyer and comprise
                 amounts invoiced for compounds sold

                 in respect of services the group collects service tax as applicable on behalf of the government and therefore it is not an economic
                 benefit flowing to the group hence it is excluded from revenue

          iv    sales return allowances

                 the group accounts for sales return by recording an allowance for sales return concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a
                 product sale the allowance is based on groups estimate of expected sales returns the estimate of sales return is determined primarily
                 by the groups historical experience in the markets in which the group operates

          v     dividends

                 dividend is recognised when the groups right to receive the payment is established which is generally when shareholders approve the
                 dividend

        assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with published statistics and mortality tables
        the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation was 8 years march 31 2016  8 years
        these defined benefit plans expose the group to actuarial risks such as longevity and interest rate risk

        sensitivity of significant actuarial assumptions is computed by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation of defined benefit obligation
        by one percentage keeping all other actuarial assumptions constant although the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of the cash
        flows expected under the plan it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown
        as of march 31 2017 and march 31 2016 the plan assets have been invested in insurer managed funds and the expected contribution to the fund
        during the year ending march 31 2018 is approximately  95 march 31 2017   77

the groups risk management is carried out by the treasury department under policies approved by the board of directors the board provides written
principles for overall risk management as well as policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk interest rate risk credit risk use of derivative
and nonderivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity

i    credit risk

       credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or customer contract leading to financial loss the
       credit risk arises principally from its operating activities primarily trade receivables and from its financing activities including deposits with banks
       and financial institutions and other financial instruments

       customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to groups established policy procedures and control relating to customer credit
       risk management the audit and risk management committee of the respective companys has established a credit policy under which each new
       customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the groups standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered the
       groups review includes external ratings where available and other publicly available financial information outstanding customer receivables are
       regularly monitored and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance

       the group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables the
       maximum exposure to credit risk as at reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to  8832 march 31 2016   7145 april 01

       allowance for credit loss                                                                                                march 31 2017     march 31 2016
       opening balance                                                                                                                        56                 90
       allowance for credit loss recognised  reversed                                                                                      34                34
       closing balance                                                                                                                        90                 56

       no single customer accounted for more than 10 of the trade receivables as of march 31 2017 and 2016 there is no significant concentration of
       credit risk

       credit risk on cash and cash equivalent and derivatives is limited as the group generally transacts with banks and financial institutions with high credit
       ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies investments primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units bonds and
       nonconvertible debentures

ii   liquidity risk

       liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled
       by delivering cash or another financial asset the groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure as far as possible that it will have sufficient
       liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage
       to the companys reputation




                                                                                                                                   financial report            259

      b     sensitivity

              the company policy is to maintain most of its borrowings at fixed rate using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary they are
              therefore not subject to interest rate risk as defined under ind as 107 since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate
              because of change in market interest rates

39 capital management
the key objective of the groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with the focus on total equity to uphold investor
creditor and customer confidence and to ensure future development of its business the group focused on keeping strong total equity base to ensure
independence security as well as a high financial flexibility for potential future borrowings if required without impacting the risk profile of the group

the companys goal is to continue to be able to return excess liquidity to shareholders by continuing to distribute annual dividends in future periods

the amount of future dividends of equity shares will be balanced with efforts to continue to maintain an adequate liquidity status

            impracticable
