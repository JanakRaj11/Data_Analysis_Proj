    managing corporate responsibility
    and sustainability 


as businesses face increasingly more reserved stakeholders as a result
of the economic crisis and the consequent lack of trust in large
enterprises the need for transparency has become all the more vital
vodafone greece has worked hard to rise to this challenge and to put in
place suitable management systems certified by recognised bodies we
recognise that maintaining and building trust which is of vital
importance requires unwavering dedication and constant alertness to
that end our systems continue to develop as we come face to face with
new issues we cannot avoid all moral issues we might have to face but
our business principles are designed so as to ensure that our
stakeholders know that vodafone greece always endeavours to make
responsible choices

    at vodafone greece in parallel with achieving our commercial
    objectives we also take into account the impact of our operations
    on society as a whole and take suitable steps in that regard with
    measurable results depending on the extent of its activities
    without this necessarily translating into financial outlays the
    company is obliged to reduce the potential negative impact and
    bolster the positive impact on the world around it
