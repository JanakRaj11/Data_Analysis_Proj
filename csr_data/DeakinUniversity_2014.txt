                   deakin is growing while the university
                   has continued to perform well on financial
                   and most social metrics our performance
                   with environmental management will need
                   careful attention in the future limiting our
                   impacts by reducing consumption and waste
                   is an important part of the picture however
                   the energy and emissions impacts of our
                   investment in facilities will dominate our
                   immediate focus

during 2013 the key issues for deakin were      however the news is not all gloomy quite
managing growth in student numbers              the contrary there are opportunities for
relocating our business and law faculty          new markets to replace dying industries and
to the geelong waterfront campus and             our researchers are leading the charge on a
completing the large infrastructure projects     global scale the information we have gained     professor jane den hollander
at all our campuses looking to 2014 and         through the gri framework gives us a logical     vicechancellor and president
beyond deregulation and other changes           approach to managing our impacts on an
mooted in the 2014 federal budget are likely     enterprisewide level what is not measured
to have a profound impact on our sector but      cannot be managed and we have a clear path
the longterm social impact is as yet unclear   to follow to improve our performance
deakins international research footprint        the most pleasing aspect as we look
continues to develop as we continue to           towards our next sustainability report is the
establish our presence in china india and       affirmation that our core business is clear
indonesia                                       and we are achieving our education and
the university will face a number of             research goals i am energised by our future
sustainability challenges over the next five     prospects and i look forward to sharing our
years including the impact of climate change    progress
globally an increasingly complex crowded

of digital change on the way universities
deliver their services and the need to

our management policies and processes
our first environmental sustainability enabling policy was published
in 2009 and commitments were made as discussed above these
aspirations were supported by the environment strategy however our
rapid and significant growth period has challenged our performance
against some targets furthermore the targets set in our environment
strategy have since been reviewed as part of the sustainability
reporting process it is clear that we have work to do to improve
our energy use and emissions reductions in particular management
processes to address our performance will include a continued focus
on tertiary education facilities management association tefma
benchmark reporting as well as a longterm improvement program
measured against the gri reporting framework
deakins procurement policy includes sustainability as a required
principle our policy states that we will endeavour to procure goods
and services that are aligned with the objectives of the environmental
sustainability enabling policy and sustainable procurement strategy
the policy commits us to undertake procurement to demonstrate
value for money probity sustainability and equity principlesthe
university supply chain is effectively decentralised with most business
units across the organisation having direct responsibility for the
purchase of goods and services required by the individual business
units procurement services are responsible for the overall strategic
direction of procurement and provide an oversight of the supply
chain to ensure policy compliance best value for money outcomes
and that sustainable procurement initiatives are delivered for the
university there were no significant changes in suppliers or location
of suppliers during 2013 as a fair trade accredited organisation our
trade relationships are global      a snapshot story of our fair trade
accreditation can be found on our website deakineduauabout
deakinsustainability
in december 2013 the vicechancellor approved the revised
investment policy the approach to investment includes endeavouring
to ensure investments incorporate appropriate environmental social
and governance esg considerations these considerations will be
part of an esg investment plan that balances financial outcomes with
esg imperatives
our approach to sustainability reporting
we take a longterm view with our reporting plan setting realistic and
achievable goals and aiming for incremental improvements in this
context the 2013 report contains standard disclosures from the gri
g4 guidelines
identifying sustainability stakeholders and the most effective
means of engagement is an ongoing process due to the complexity
of a multicampus university and the early stage of maturity with
our sustainability reporting we recognise we have work to do
in documenting our processes of engagement and ensuring we
focus our reporting activities on what is relevant to sustainability
stakeholders stakeholder groups with an interest in deakins
sustainability performance were identified as students staff local
communities and government4
these stakeholders were identified on the basis of their interaction
with the university through our activities peoplerelationships and
or by the location of our campuses 5

the importance of security
deakin university is generally a safe place to work study and enjoy
the campus facilities with very little risk of being subject to threats
or violence however there have been occasions where staff and
students have been subject to threats or have felt threatened in
these situations it is important to know what to do so our staff are
trained and educated about appropriate safety procedures
similarly students need to feel safe and secure at all times and
deakin security officers are on duty 24 hours a day 7 days a week
and are based at all campuses these officers are easily identified
by their uniforms which have a deakin security badge on them
security officers are trained on deakin security policies procedures
and emergency arrangements as well as to level 2 first aid internal
contact for security officers is extension 222 and security can also be
contacted externally
deakinsafe is a program of work approved in august 2013 comprising
a capital investment of more than 16 million during 2013 project
planning commenced for rollout in 2014 with a stateoftheart
emergency and safety communication centre as the centrepiece
safezone is a free app for all deakin university students and staff
that connects directly to the security team if a person needs help on
campus the app makes it easier to contact security and helps them
to respond by sending the persons name and location directly to the
response team members by installing the safezone app available
on apple and android devices registered users also receive critical
notifications from the university      a snapshot story on campus
