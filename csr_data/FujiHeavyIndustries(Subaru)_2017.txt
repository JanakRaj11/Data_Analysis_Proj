we want to better meet our customers expectations and ensure that even more customers can
experience the enjoyment of life with an impreza that was the powerful wish that drove us
from the moment we started developing the allnew impreza and it still inspires us today we
asked ourselves what kind of car we would need to end up with to make that wish come true
the search for an answer to that question became the ﬁrst stage in the car s development
rather than merely seeking improvements we decided to pursue a transformative evolution in the
values that subaru oﬀers to customers enjoyment and peace of mind we would create a product
that enabled everyone to clearly discern these values and recognize them as the cars fundamental
appeal the answer that we came up with and which became the development concept itself was
this delivering the utmost enjoyment and peace of mind for driver and passengers alike

                                                                                             ｓｕｂａｒｕ corporation csr report 2017

going beyond a full model change to take on the challenge of building the
infrastructure for the next generation of subaru vehicles

achieving a transformative evolution in safety performance and driving enjoyment  strengths
of subaru as a whole  was the essential requirement for translating this concept into reality
this meant that we had to go beyond a full model change and rethink the platform from
scratch to put it another way we had to take on the huge challenge of developing the infrastructure
for subarus next generation i thought that we could only create the infrastructure for
the next generation of subaru vehicles if we achieved a substantial evolution expressed as
worldclass allaround safety performance and quality that far surpasses its class if we
did not succeed with this car as the ﬁrst of the next generation there was no way that we
could succeed with the cars that followed consequently every member of the project team
felt a tremendous sense of responsibility and pressure in embarking on development
over the 15 years or so since the launch of the fourthgeneration legacy for which the current
platform was developed our engineers have built up various skills and knowhow crucial to
improving safety performance and driving enjoyment we poured all of this into the newly
developed platform in one go as well as developing the allnew impreza this would lead to
the construction of the infrastructure that subaru needs to continue to deliver the utmost
enjoyment and peace of mind globally with this aspiration in mind we chose the name
subaru global platform for the newly developed platform
the development of this platform has not simply enabled us to signiﬁcantly enhance dynamic
quality and allaround safety performance throughout the subaru range it also achieves
greater eﬃciency in development and ﬂexibility in production processes designed with a
view to producing not only gasoline engine vehicles but also hybrids plugin hybrids
phevs and electric vehicles evs

the most critical theme in delivering the utmost enjoyment and
peace of mind is safety performance based on the subaru concept
of safety we took an uncompromising approach to raising all
aspects of safety performance  primary safety active safety
preventive safety and passive safety  to a level unmatched elsewhere
in the realm of primary safety we minimized blind spots to ensure
excellent visibility and created a fatigueresistant driving space
further enhancing peace of mind while driving in terms of active
safety the unsurpassed driving experience provided by the subaru
global platform enabled us to deliver outstanding danger avoidance
capability that puts the allnew impreza in the top of its class
                                                                                                       crash test using a car ﬁtted with

finally in the arena of passive safety the subaru global platform
delivers outstanding collision impact absorption capability
in addition we made the allnew impreza the ﬁrst japanese
vehicle to be ﬁtted with a pedestrian protection airbag 1  which
minimizes injury to pedestrians
oﬀering even greater safety not only for the driver and passengers
but also for people outside the car the allnew impreza was
awarded the collision safety performance assessment grand

 the subaru group engages in csr activities aimed at contributing to the creation of a better
society and the environment through our core business activities to achieve a sustainable society




   our approach to csr


   challenges for society abound in japan and overseas such as global warming human
   rights issues and an aging and declining population and there are rising expectations
   that corporations will help resolve themthe subaru group s business domain also
   requires initiatives on diverse themes such as reducing environmental impact preventing
   traﬃc accidents and alleviating traﬃc congestion


   therefore naturally we develop manufacture and sell products with outstanding
   safety and environmental performance and quality but as a corporate citizen we
   also work on csr activities to meet the needs of society and address social challenges
   in good faith we reviewed how we can contribute to society through our business
   and how to meet the expectations and needs of our stakeholders amid a constantly
   changing social environment as a result we have reaﬃrmed that the eight action
   items we have established as the categories for our csr activities to date form the
   b as i s fo r a ll o f o u r b u s i n e ss a ct i v i t i es 


   going forward we will deliver enjoyment and peace of mind to all of our stakeholders
   including our customers as a compelling company with strong market presence in
   addition to enhancing the corporate value of the subaru group and contributing to the
   creation of a more aﬄuent and sustainable society by ensuring that our business activities
   are based on the eight csr action items

                                               safety is our dna


having roots in the aircraft industry the subaru group considers safety to be the most important
feature underpinning automobiles since we launched the subaru 360 over a halfcentury ago
to this day we have engaged in automotive manufacturing with a philosophy of allaround
safety and maximum emphasis on safety performance

    danger in addition one of the indispensable safety features of smaller aircraft is the ability
    for the pilot to be able to secure an allaround unobstructed line of sight this approach to
    safety has not diminished even after we moved into automobile manufacturing since

fundamental automobile performance in terms of
driving turning and braking diﬀers depending on
the vehicles structure in particular the location of
the center of gravity and the type of drive train have
a signiﬁcant eﬀect the lower the center of gravity
the more stable the cornering while a drive train that
delivers power to all of the wheels gives constant
stability when driving this is the perspective that
led subaru in 1966 to launch the subaru 1000a fwd
vehicle with a horizontallyopposed engineand in
1972 the 4wd subaru leone since that time we
have further honed our proprietary technologies and
continued to pursue safe and stable driving performance

                                 thoughts on active safety


active safety is an approach to safety based on preventing
accidents assuming that accidents may occur in the event of
an accident for safe avoidance it is important to maintain
vehicle stability no diﬀerent from normal under a variety of
weather and road conditions


based on the idea that the ultimate drive fosters safety the        h o r iz o n t ally o ppo s ed engi ne

exceptional fundamental performance delivered by our
horizontallyopposed subaru boxer engine and symmetrical
allwheel drive are the basis for reﬁnement of vehicle performance
that enables users to drive with conﬁdence in all kinds of
environment and climate

                            thoughts on precrash safety


precrash safety is an approach that supports drivers driving operations and predicts
hazards with the aim of helping reduce damage in the event of a collision


we were quick to introduce the idea of precrash safety and have proceeded with development
eyesight ver2 adopts a stereo camera for judging conditions in front of the vehicle as
well as linkage to the engine transmission and brakes for hazard avoidance and has been
highly evaluated as an advanced driving support system moreover in june 2014 in addition
to substantially upgrading the stereo camera with a complete redesign including its recognition
performance we launched the new model wrx and levorg equipped with eyesight ver3
with added steering assist control legacy and forester have also been equipped
w i t h eyesight ver3 and we are working to increase the models ﬁtted with the system


also impreza that went through full model change in october last year and xv in april this
year are equipped with eyesight ver3

                               thoughts on passive safety


passive safety is an approach to safety technology that aims
to minimize damage in the event of an accident


we have promoted development considering safety in all aspects
of a vehicle with an original crash safety body featuring a new       im age o f im pr e z a j nca p
ringshaped reinforcement frame body structure and engine             f r o n t al oﬀ s e t c r a s h test

layout etc for mitigating collision impact on vehicle occupants
cabin occupants are of course protected but we also consider
collision with pedestrians in its safety system for which it is
highly acclaimed not only in japan but also throughout the world


furthermore we have achieved greater passive safety capability
by increasing the amount of energy absorbed at the time of
impact by a factor of 14 over past systems with the next generation
platform the subaru global platform introduced last year

                                        compliance hotline


in addition to discussing with their supervisors any compliance issues they encounter the
subaru group employees and temporary employees have the option of using the compliance
hotline and reporting issues directly to the hotline desk located within subaru


after receiving information via mail telephone or email employees assigned to the hotline
desk research situations and take appropriate actions based on subarus internal rules
the names and departments of those making reports are kept strictly conﬁdential to
prevent reprisals since april 2008 a specialist company external to the subaru group has
provided s e r v i c e s t o t h e h o t l i n e d e s k i n t h e f o r m o f a n o u t s i d e s e r v i c e  a l l o w i n g t h e
compliance hotline to extend its hours and helping to ensure the conﬁdentiality of
t h e n a m e s a n d departments of those making reports the result has been greater ease of use
for all employees making use of the hotline


the number of consultations to compliance hotline in fy2017 was 60 and its breakdown is
as follows in order to respond to these issues we look into the facts carefully with
l e g a l department general manager being mainly in charge to resolve problems as quickly as
possible also they are reported to the management or compliance committee as necessary
to prevent recurrence


furthermore to publicize the hotline system we have distributed cards which display the
workings of the system and the contact details for the hotlines to the subaru group employees
while at the same time putting up posters in workplaces in addition to including explanations
of the services provided by the external specialist company on the posters we have posted
the information on the inhouse intranet screen

                company organizational bodies


we have adopted a board of corporate auditors system in which board of directors and
the board of corporate auditors perform decision making oversight and auditing of the
execution of important business operations
in order to maintain diversity and balance in knowledge experience and ability for the
board of directors that is required for the sustainable longevity of the company
and improvement of corporate value over the mid and longterm several outside directors
have been selected for the board of directors taking into consideration the experience
insight and expertise of corporate managers and experts
in addition internal directors are selected by comprehensively evaluating and judging
experience insight and expertise in light of the requirements for directors derived from
t h e corporate philosophy and management strategy


the board of directors consists of 15 directors maximum including both in and out of our
company in accordance with the articles of incorpration
the board of directors in fy2017 is composed of eight directors two of whom are highly
independent outside directors to further strengthen governance the chairman of the
board is concurrently served by president not by executive oﬃcers


the board of auditors is composed of four corporate auditors two of whom are outside
corporate auditors to provide objective oversight of management


with regard to the system for the execution of business operations important issues
that require consultation with the board of directors are thoroughly discussed at the
executive management board meeting which deliberates on companywide management
strategy and the execution of key business operations in addition to employing an executive
oﬃcer system we have placed the automotive business at the core and have introduced an
inhouse company system for the aerospace business division with the aim of clarifying
responsibility and speeding up execution of business operations


along with expanding the scope of management we are striving to strengthen the functionality
of the board of directors with the aim of improving oversight and speeding up execution of
business operations by separating management and execution of business operations and
to strengthen global business management and industrial monitoring functionality related
to management overall by newly establishing a business management headquarters a chief
quality oﬃcer cqo a chief technology oﬃcer cto and a chief information oﬃcer cio

for smaller facilities with investments of less than 25 million yen the costs for capital
investments and maintenance costs limited to environmental purposes are totaled
in addition depreciation of equipment for which an investment was made is not included
in the environmental cost from the viewpoint of cash ﬂows other expenses such as ﬁxed
assets taxes and insurance costs are also omitted from the total environmental cost and
economic eﬀect of environmental facilities are included only for three years from the
year after the facilities are put into operation



fy2017 calculation results


environmental cost came to 345 billion yen on a nonconsolidated basis up 221 billion yen 68
from the previous ﬁscal year and 362 billion yen on a consolidated basis up 249 billion yen 74
the cost increase was mainly due to an increase in research and development rd costs 215
billion yen on a nonconsolidated basis the ratio of environmental cost to sales which is one of

our approach to environmentally friendly automobiles


approaches and strategies for improving fuel economy

in recent years major issues for automobile manufacturers are how to save fuel while in use
and how to contribute to preventing global warming by reducing co2 emissions


we thoroughly pursue improvements in fuel eﬃciency by expanding use of direct fuel injection
engine and introducing allnew redesigned downsized turbo engines for internal combustion
engine vehicles that account for the majority of our products and aim for achieving top level
fuel eﬃciency in segment with the net thermal eﬃciency of 40 or more


in addition in order to advance fuel eﬃciency for the vehicle overall transmission eﬃciency
was further advanced by friction reduction in the transmission and the body was improved
by promoting weight reduction by subaru global platform sgp aerodynamic and friction
improvements in transmission functions overall


through these initiatives we are considering development of a newgeneration environmental
strategy vehicle with a view to 2020 and beyond


in addition we are promoting development the deployment of electric vehicles that meet
the us zeroemission vehicle zev regulations and fuel consumption regulations of various
nations that are becoming more strict aiming toward development of phv vehicles true to
the subaru identity and we will introduce them to the us market in 2018 and our ev globally
in 2021


through these initiatives we are aiming for the top class fuel eﬃciency among suv category
and will continue to work toward improving fuel eﬃciency

plantderived materials and conﬁrmed that there was no negative impact on the environment
during the procurement process in addition our main oﬃce has switched to 100 recycled
copy paper that does not use new plant resources and we plan to sequentially switch over
at other facility as well




    environmental management system request to
                 business partners


the subaru group requests based on the green procurement guidelines that business
partners formulate an environmental management system with the acquisition of iso14001
thirdparty certiﬁcation at its base we request the business partners who have diﬃculty
acquiring iso14001 to pass eco action 21 or our voluntary examination
to those business partners who have passed our voluntary examination we make inquiries
or perform audits as necessary and request them to continue eﬀorts toward early acquisition
of thirdparty certiﬁcation for environmental management

facility in december 2015 to use energy more eﬀectively
emissions of co 2 was reduced by a third compared to conventional
systems due to the cleanness of city gas used as the fuel for gas
cogeneration and the eﬀective use of waste heat

reducing the environmental impact of transport of subaru automobiles


during the transport of subaru automobiles we are making
eﬀorts to reduce the environmental burden by promoting eﬃcient
transport such as setting optimized transportation routes
promoting modal shifts and improving loading eﬃciency by
ﬂexibly responding to changes in the ﬁnished car model mix
and to larger model types to be transported


in recent years we have been able to reduce the amount of fuel
use improved fuel eﬃciency and co 2 emissions from completed
vehicle transportation by eﬀectively using the improved tokyo
metropolitan highway network

optimizing parts supply


we established ﬁve domestic area parts centers from october 2013 to october 2016 with the
goal of making part supply more eﬃcient


in addition co 2 emissions during transportation were reduced by 648 compared to fy2013
by consolidating the parts warehouses that had been scattered among the 44 subaru domestic
dealerships throughout japan and reviewing the transportation routes



introduction of natural gas vehicles sia


sia the us production base of subaru of vehicles is cooperation with venture logistics
which is responsible for parts delivery supplier and will proceed with the introduction of
natural gas vehicles
compressed natural gas cng has a lower environmental impact than diesel fuel and is
superior in terms of cost eﬃciency and reliable one signiﬁcant hurdle to cng was that there
were no supply stations for natural gas close by sia ﬁnanced the purchase of cng ﬂeet
trucks for venture and promoted the introduction by establishing cng fueling stations to its
property
as a result of introducing cng ﬂeet trucks 1097 tons of co2 emissions per day were
eliminated corresponding to 85 of emissions before the introduction cng costs were
also reduced by a total of 389136 compared to using diesel fuel

and heat insulating properties and a cool heat trench that takes      the eﬀect of the balcony eaves
outside air from a ventilation tower through an underground
isolation layer are also adopted to precool or preheat the air
and then supply the air to each ﬂoor the building plans also
introduced several innovations such as providing balconies to
create a solar radiation shielding eﬀect while creating rest areas
contributing to both energy conservation and a comfortable
working environment without relying only on machinery

            environment  recyclingbased society


       our approach to recyclingbased society

the subaru group understands that constructing a recyclingbased society is an important
theme that is closely related to corporations in the manufacturing industry
we aim to build a recyclingbased society through having 100 automobiletoautomobile
recycling to the extent possible considering the product life cycle continuing to send zero
landﬁll from domestic and foreign production plants to landﬁlls and aiming for a higher
dimensional recycling
speciﬁcally we put resource recycling as one of the themes of our voluntary plan for the
environment which is the policy for environmental activities of the entire group and we
will steadily implement an environmental conservation voluntary action plan based on it




                       automobile recycling process

the automobile recycling law calls for recycling of shredder dust airbags etc and treating
chloroﬂuorocarbons when an automobile has reached endoflife under this law most of
endoflife vehicles are treated properly in japan and japans automobile recycling rate has
reached 978 please see news realease

reuse of packaging materials


subaru logistics co ltd which handles packaging and transport
for complete knockdown ckd parts of subaru automobiles has
been carrying out activities to reduce environmental impact
focusing on the reuse of packaging materials
the amount of reused packaging materials in fy2017 was 6522
tons 19 increase from the previous year this was caused by the
addition of the impreza to the models produced in the united           plastic tray for calipe r s

states and the increased production of the legacy


in addition the amount of reused packaging material newly
purchased was 153 a 12 point reduction from the previous
year the cause for the reduction in new purchases was in sharing
materials among car models and the reduction in damaged products
we will continue to carry out environmental impact reduction           foam for drive shaft s
activities by expanding the reuse of packaging materials

zero emission at domestic dealers


from april 2012 subaru dealers began improving appropriate treatment activities for waste
generated from their business activities to promote environmental conservation
collaboration and cooperation with a body of companies and industrial organizations are
being carried out for resource recycling as well as a review of conventional treatment methods
leading to zero emission activities targeting resource recycling within japan various activities
are being developed including recycling of used leadacid batteries waste oil used tires etc
as the result of these activities in fy2017 1348 tons of used leadacid batteries 208231 used
batteries 5290 kiloliters of used oil and 197902 used tires were collected and recycled
we believe that the zero emission activities of dealers who are closest to stakeholders are
environmental conservation activities closer to home they are also able to provide a safe and
secure environment in addition to products by promoting more eﬀective use and appropriate
processing through deﬁning corporate responsibility and recycling resources

recycling waste oil


waste oil generated at all subaru domestic dealerships during
oil changes is recycled as recycled fuel oil based on the zero
emissions scheme created by us
every year farmers in yamagata prefecture can grow beautiful
poinsettia and cyclamen using this recycled fuel oil for heating
greenhouses
these cyclamens were given to visitors to our event held in
december 2016

recycling used tires


used tires changed and collected at subaru domestic dealers
are crushed and made into rubber chips which are then
reused as fuel at plants such as power plant paper making
company pulp and iron factoryetc in addition to this kind of
thermal recovery we have started to reuse these chips as
paving materials the used tires made into rubber chips are
mixed in asphalt or applied as an overlay of asphalt pavement        staﬀ parking

they can be used for parking lots childrens playgrounds
athletic ﬁelds and sidewalks of hospitalsnursery homes with
varied blending ratios of chips depending on the use we not
only recycle the outer layer of the tires but the entire rubber
parts of those tires for pavement materials by sorting each part
thoroughly such as wires rubber components etc we are the
ﬁrst car manufacturer to recycle all the rubber parts of a tire        stellar town animal square
for pavement materials

dismantling facilities with consideration for the environment
 new construction method the ﬁrst in japan dramatically reduces
environmental impact


the demolition work performed from july 2016 to march 2017
to rebuild our gunma manufacturing division west building
adopted a new construction method the ﬁrst in japan that
m i n i m i z e d the impact on the surrounding environment with the
cooperation of the construction company in charge of the work
with this new construction method there was virtually no vibration
during demolition and noise transmitted to the site boundary
was reduced to about 34 of that produced by conventional
methods in addition the amount of dust was kept to below
10 of that produced by conventional methods

                  environment  water resources



                        our approach to water resources


in our business activities we perform appropriate management to ensure use and discharge
water by establishing targets


the following are established targets for water usage




          m i d  t e r m t a rg e t f o r w a t e r u s a g e  d ec r ea s e t h e w a t er u s a g e p er u n i t b y 1  every

for fy2017 we were able to reduce water usage per unit to 169m3100 million yen less
t h a n t h e r e d u c t i o n t a r g e t o f 2 9 2 m 3 1 0 0 m i l l i o n y e n 


the total amount of water usage and the consumption unit are managed by totalling the
amount of water for each work site and reporting and verifying these ﬁgures at the biannual
meeting


water quality management is performed by constant monitoring setting voluntary standards
that are 20 higher than legal standards for water quality and regularly conducting voluntary
inspections as well as thirdparty inspections
there were no water quality test results that did not meet the voluntary management standards

           environment  preventing pollution



           our approach to preventing pollution


the subaru group has the earth the sky and nature are subarus ﬁelds of business as
its environmental philosophy and understands that the prevention of pollution to the soil
air and groundwater is an important responsibility for the continuation of a sustainable
society and our business based on this we established voluntary action standards above
and beyond the legal standards and processes soil air groundwater noise etc appropriately




                        initiatives in production


voc reduction


the amount of volatile organic compounds vocs we emitted from the automobile coating
process was 477gm2 in fy2017 down 478 from fy2001 levels
we realized the reduction in voc emission mainly by decreasing the use of cleaning thinners
and increasing the recovery of used thinners



prevention of soil and underground water pollution


we have voluntarily performed soil and groundwater tests at our facilities since 1998 and
have implemented puriﬁcation measures and groundwater monitoring as required
since the 2003 soil contamination countermeasures act came into eﬀect we have been
ﬁling reports and conducting tests in accordance with the law



status of storage and management of pcb wastes


we store pcb waste appropriately according to the law and processes them based on a
suitable plan so that processing is completed by a predetermined time



                                                                      ｓｕｂａｒｕ corporation csr report 2017

           environment  biodiversity



                   our approach to biodiversity


recognizing the importance of preserving biodiversity the subaru group makes clear in its
environmental principles that it strives to address environmental issues on a global scale
including biodiversity through all business activities while referencing external initiatives
such as the guidelines for private sector engagement in biodiversity and declaration of
biodiversity  guide to action policy by keidanren federation of economic organizations
we are also in the process of creating an active biodiversity preservation network through
participation in the japan business and biodiversity partnership
based on these ideas we launched a working group in fy2015 across all business sites
divided business activities into risks and oppprtunities created a road map and steadily
supported and promoted these initiatives to the entire group




                            domestic initiatives

         initiatives for prevention of global warming


again in fy2017 energy conservation activities were promoted by managing energy use at
each work site which led to reduction in total co2 emissions
unnecessary energy use was reduced by implementing an energy conservation patrol at all
factories and work sites
for equipmentfacility improvements a switch to led lighting and updating to energy
saving air conditioners are still ongoing
the co2 total emissions base unit was a 6 reduction from fy2007 levels
we will continue further eﬀorts in energy conservation and contributions in preventing

  scenario planninganalysis is just strategy formulation at the very least an interdepartmental
team from the head oﬃces corporate planning ﬁnance and accounting csr and environment
ir and purchasing departments should begin research and deliberations with the assistance of
external experts if required there are only three or four years left so it is now or never
  subarus environment policies have been revised based on the concept that the earth the
sky and nature are subarus ﬁelds of business until now the prevailing approach to environmental
measures across the globe has been that business activities come ﬁrst with companies seeking
to internalize the external diseconomies environmental destruction of those activities as much
as possible as i perceive it your companys new policy spells out the fact that the company is
part of the environment which is excellent

i wonder whether this will be considered in the voluntary action plan for the period through to

  it is splendid to see that you are actually undertaking a variety of environmental initiatives
but i hope that you will consider re100 100 renewable energy as a mitigation measure due
to various constraints eﬀorts to promote widespread use of re and reduce its cost are lagging
behind in japan but in the us it appears possible that solar power will be cheaper than grid
power by the 2020s so i would recommend that you consider advanced examples in the us
adaptation measures will be considered in scenario analyses
  i think that you need to analyze why the overseas aﬃliates have higher co 2 emissions than subaru
itself even though their energy use is lower

the area of innovation it will likely take more than 20 years to consistently produce a certain
number of female executives for example from within the company even if you launch initiatives
now in the interim i hope that you will at least make full use of women in committees focused
on the environment csr and risks and also in decisionmaking

response to the third party opinion


  thank you for providing your opinion again this year on the environment section of
our csr report 2017


  you were kind enough to praise our environmental policies which we revised last
april for spelling out the fact that the company is part of the environment partly in
response to the revision of iso14001 but also with the objective of making our corporate
management more sensitive to the environment we revised our environmental policies and
are working to ensure that our environmental management is seamlessly integrated with
our corporate management


  climate change is the most important challenge faced worldwide today and it is
closely linked to our companys business activities and products taking this very
seriously we will strive to implement the most proactive initiatives possible while
reﬂecting opinions from both inside and outside the company in order to achieve
more stable resilient and sustainable management


  furthermore in publishing this report we will give consideration to ensuring that
all our various stakeholders understand these activities initiatives of our company


  going forward we will continue our eﬀorts to make an even greater contribution
to the sustainability of society and promote speciﬁc activities to this end including
the matters you have pointed out for our consideration

now we are stepping up our support systems so that employees can balance childcare
responsibilities with work while seeking career development at the same time




 initiatives aimed at reducing long working hours


in addition to the set hours days no overtime days that we had already established we
established a new ultraset hours day in fy2016 when all employees including managers
leave work at the set time throughout the entire company this required the formulation
and implementation of even more eﬃcient operations plans than in the past as a result of this
initiative employee awareness about working hours has increased including the situation
regarding leaving work on no overtime days


moreover starting in fy2017 we are reducing the core time of ﬂexitime work from four to
two hours to facilitate work styles that are more tailored to various ﬂuctuations in work
this contributes to the fulﬁlment of employees private life and reducing working hours
such as in cases where employees can go home early at times of low workload
