fujitsu uki
a responsible
business
2016

the essence of corporate social responsibility csr i believe is listening
to the voices of stakeholders and flexibly adapting management practices
based on the premise of sustainability in society and business

there are however some elements we should not change these include
fujitsus promise to walk shoulder to shoulder with customers earn their
trust and use technology to cocreate a humancentric society that is safer
more prosperous and more sustainable i firmly believe that fujitsus
technology makes people happier

at present i feel that there are two transformations to which we must
respond

the first transformation is global society there are many people in the
world who lack access to safe food and water and live with inadequate
educational and medical services a host of problems are worsening due
to urbanisation and aging societies these problems however cannot be
solved by intensifying our current measures to address them in striving to
achieve the un sustainable development goals sdgs fujitsu believes
that its corporate mission is to transform society through the power of
technology

the second transformation to respond to is digital society ict creates
new value through digital transformation that spreads to the many
corners of business and society progress of the internet of things
artificial intelligence and other endeavours makes problem solving and
collaboration between humans and machines possible at the same time
new areas of concern involving data security privacy and decrease of
employment call for stronger responses i believe that it is important for
fujitsu in line with our responsibility as a global ict company to reduce any
negative impacts of our business activities on society while scaling up our      contents
businesses that benefit society

as part of our worldwide corporate responsibility fujitsu supports and is a     executive summary              4
signatory to the un global compacts 10 principles in the areas of human
rights labour the environment and anticorruption going forward we           materiality                    6
will devote ourselves to respecting and upholding these principles and to
the review and improvement of socially responsible activities with zero           emeia responsible business
tolerance for exceptions we will carry out these social responsibilities with    programme                      7
no exceptions and continuously review and improve our activities as for
compliance we have implemented the global compliance programme                   our people                    8

message from lucy dimes


i am extremely proud to be leading fujitsu uk  ireland in its journey to be
an ever more valued accountable and sustainable business we believe
our survival and growth depends on being responsible at all levels  from
our strategic direction to the myriad of services we deliver every day to
organisations and citizens throughout the uki over the last year weve
invested in training thousands of talented fujitsu employees and apprentices
and collaborated with hundreds of small businesses across the region at
the same time we are continuing to enable a lowcarbon society through
innovative technology solutions developed at our european research
laboratories headquartered in the uk
at fujitsu we have four core objectives
 results  deliver great results in everything we do
 people  be a great place to work for everyone we employ
 customers  go beyond customer satisfaction in every relationship
 society be a responsible accountable business in society and a
   good company in every community we serve
these objectives are interrelated so we have to pursue all of them together all the time  not just those
that seem most immediately profitable or praiseworthy we prioritise but never abandon a good idea or
sacrifice an objective for the sake of expedience or temporary gain so the activities we undertake with
and on behalf of our communities have equal standing with our commercial and legal objectives and
responsibilities

that have truly built shared value into their business models after a year of convening collaborating
and challenging our peers especially in the areas of megatrends and future leaders we look forward to
continuing our work to bring others into this movement

publishing a comprehensive responsible business report this year we are following the global
reporting index g4 guidance and focusing on our material issues including data security employee
diversity engagement and wellbeing and improving access to digital services at fujitsu we are
passionate about technologys potential in the face of the megatrends that are shaping our planet
challenges such as resource scarcity population growth an aging society and mass urbanisation can
be helped by innovative technological solutions that are developed in collaboration with stakeholders
some of which are detailed in this report

we implemented a fasttrack onboarding process that makes it
easier for lowrisk smes to become an approved supplier to fujitsu
this is a simpler process which requires an sme to agree to a code
of conduct rather than provide policy and process documentation
the process enables smes to onboard more effectively whilst
managing fujitsus risk appropriately we have seen year on year
growth on the number of contracts awarded to smes which reflects
the commitment to making our supply chain more accessible to
small businesses
