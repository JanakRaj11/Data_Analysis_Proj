                                           2015 annual report
                                         bastion of
                                   the circular economy

over the past year discarded electrical and electronic   in 2015 recupel was able to make progress in every
equipment was collected processed and reclaimed in       link of the value chain from awarenessraising through
such a costefficient manner as to make recupel an        to urban mining
indisputable bastion of the circular economy

    1 awarenessraising


    in 2015 recupel was able to motivate every belgian to bring in an
    average 10kg of electrical and electronic waste
    in 2015 raising the awareness of consumers and prompting them to turn in their
    unused electrical and electronic appliances more quickly remained one of recupels top
    objectives to achieve this recupel threw a panoply of triedandtested campaign recipes
    and new initiatives into the fray

    all together the campaigns were able to convince belgians to bring in 111356 tonnes of discarded electrical and
    electronic appliances or more than 10kg per belgian this puts belgium amongst the global leaders in terms of
    collected volume per inhabitant only norway sweden and switzerland do better


    what makes this result even more striking is the fact that on average the weight of collected appliances is on the
    decline  just think of the shrinking number of cathoderay tvs in circulation the everlighter flat screens and so
    on in other words proportionally a lot more appliances have to be picked up in order to see an increase in the
    overall collected volume


    the campaigns owed their effectiveness in part to a competition element productspecific awarenessraising
    focusing on eg defective lamps and garden tools convincing communication of the significant benefits of
    electrorecycling mobile campaigns and a savvy media mix

recycling competitions

the second edition of recycleergem an intermunicipal recycling competition once again proved to be a great
success with 315 participating municipalities 234 in flanders 74 in wallonia and 7 in brussels the inhabitants of
the three winning municipalities celles zingem and watermaalbosvoorde were treated to a picnic breakfast by
recupel during recycleergem a total of 8830 tonnes of ewaste were collected throughout belgium


on top of that recupel facilitated numerous spontaneous collection actions by schools and associations
which together accounted for another 10 tonnes of ewaste




specific campaigns

targeted campaigns convinced many belgians to bring in defective lamps andor disused garden tools in addition
belgians whose old kitchen range hoods were due for replacement were prompted to give it more serious thought
as a result of the new energy label

communication of the benefits

other campaigns successfully drew attention to the interest and significant benefits of electrorecycling via radio
print and a youtube video the general public was made aware of both the raw materials that recycling makes
available again the socalled urban mining and the environmental pollution that  thanks to recycling  is avoided


     on average the collected devices are becoming steadily lighter in weight
     in order to increase the volume therefore more and more devices have to
     be picked up


mobile campaign techniques

in 2015 the mobile campaign initiative recupel on tour conducted in collaboration with municipalities
intermunicipal waste utility companies and reuse shops kringwinkels accounted for 36 local collection actions
during which 12000 electronic and electrical appliances were picked up of the 97 tonnes of collected ewaste
33 tonnes of it could go to recycling shops for resale while 64 tonnes were processed and recycled by recupel




savvy media mix

each campaign received its own customtailored media strategy in which press radio tv and billposting were used
as well as minisites mailings and partner media

    2 collection results


    with 859 new recyclepoints in supermarkets and diy stores
    the threshold for bringing in ewaste was once again significantly
    reduced in 2015
    the collection possibilities rose substantially in particular for small electrical appliances
    not in the least thanks to 859 new recyclepoints in supermarkets diy stores and
    electronics stores for which a new lamps box was also introduced in 2015 at the end
    of the year the number of these recyclepoints that could be found at retailers already
    stood at 1506

         recupel continues to respond to the earlier finding that 95 of consumers
         appreciate the recyclepoint as a lowthreshold alternative method for proper
         recycling

    3 recycling figures


    over 90 of the collected ewaste received a new useful
    application in 2015
    moreover belgium is the only european member state that sets legal objectives for the recycling of ferrous
    nonferrous and synthetic materials in 2015 recupel did better than the legal minimums for all fractions
    for many fractions the recycling percentage is now approaching 100


         in 2015 recupel did better than the legal minimums for all fractions

    4 employment


    recupel generated almost 1200 jobs in 2015
    a study conducted by the research agency rdc for recupel showed that recupels
    activities generate almost 1200 jobs from transporters and processors to samplers and
    workplaces in the reuse sector

    around onethird of these jobs are situated in the social economy the social employment could be expanded to
    413 ftes in 2015

    5 efficiency gain


    in 2015 our chain was already so efficient that we were
    nominated for a supply chain award for the first time
    peter sabbe general manager
    thanks in part to a thorough optimisation of the logistics and the development of an
    adrproof pallet box excellent results in the area of cost efficiency could also be booked
    in 2015

    optiweee

    onethird of recupels budget is devoted to covering the logistical costs generated by the collection and processing
    of ewaste more than enough reason to roll out a reverse logistics optimization project in 2015


         with its optiweee project recupel brought the logistical costs down by
         a good 10
    under the motto better faster  cheaper this optiweee project was able to reduce the logistical costs by over
    10 thanks to a substantial reduction in the number of driven kilometres and thus also in co2 emissions an effort
    that was crowned with a nomination for a supply chain award




    weee palletbox

    in 2015 recupel also unveiled an adaptation of the pallet box so that it henceforth meets the new european adr
    regulations for transporting electronic devices in which lithium batteries are processed this adaptation was a
    european first moreover once empty the easytodisassemble box can be compactly transported and stored
    an extra bonus for transport and storage costs

    6 financial balance sheet


    structural reduction of financial reserves
    the total financial reserves provisions and working reserves built up by a cautious approach of the initial
    contributions are being systematically further reduced this reduction began in 2009 with an adaptation of the
    contributions the objective is to arrive at a payasyougo system whereby the recupel contribution belonging to
    an appliance fully covers the costs of the collection transport and recycling





7




    7 satisfaction gain



    in 2015 the personnel policy also demonstrated sustainability
    recupel employees felt pretty good in 2015

    at least that can be inferred from the minimal staff turnover and a sickness leave rate that fell to an historical low
    of 155 coming from 199 in 2014 and 708 in 2013


    in 2015 recupel still worked exclusively with permanent contracts for 20 dutch native speakers and 6 french native
    speakers three colleagues departed and two new employees were welcomed female employees 14 maintained
    a slight numerical edge over the men on recupels payroll 12


         in terms of both satisfaction and commitment the recupel personnel scores
         a good deal better than the benchmark
    in 2015 teleworking possibilities became accessible for the entire employee pool in terms of mobility almost one
    fifth of employees come to work at least regularly by bicycle this means that the number of bicycle compensations
    quintupled compared to 2014 and employees once again received plenty of opportunities to expand their
    knowledge during  on average  24 hours of training per personnel member on an annual basis

    the biennial personnel satisfaction survey showed that recupel maintained its lead on the market with an average
    satisfaction of 72 recupel does better than the benchmark of 69 for belgian companies the recupel personnel
    also score significantly better than the benchmark 69 with regard to commitment 73

    8 environment and climate results


    in 2015 recupel kept 13566 tonnes of harmful substances out of
    the environment
    co2 emissions could be further reduced thanks to innovations in eg logistics and the
    vehicle fleet and in the depollution process climatefriendly manual processing once
    again gained in importance recupel can also present excellent figures for climate and
    environmental benefits



    depollution

    in 2015 recupel and its approved partners made sure that 13566 tonnes of harmful substances from old batteries
    compressors cathode ray tubes etc did not end up in the environment in 2014 this number was still 14975
    tonnes a decrease that can be attributed to the trend for electrical and electronic appliances to contain less and
    less harmful substances


    in addition to mechanical processing processors in 2015 also continued to invest in manual depollution because
    this results in even more thorough depollution



    emission reduction

         thanks to training courses on epositive driving co² emissions could be
         reduced by 5 tonnes
    while in logistics the number of superfluous kilometres were reduced by 10 see also link 5 optiweee emissions
    were also reduced in the vehicle fleet not only did the average emission of company cars fall further from 11612
    gkm 2014 to 1145 gkm 2015 the training courses on epositive driving produced results consumption dropped
    by 64 equivalent to an annual savings of 1936 litres of fuel or more than 5 tonnes of co²

    9 raw materials balance sheet


    in 2015 over 80000 tonnes of raw materials became available
    once again for the production of new appliances
    recupels urban mining ensured that a record volume of raw materials no longer had to
    be extracted via classic mining methods

    in 2015 stakeholders in belgium also became increasingly aware of the enormous economic importance of urban
    mining the trend towards recovering raw materials from the ewaste of the city


         thanks to recupel over 80000 tonnes of raw materials no longer have to be
         extracted via classic mining methods
    in 2015 on top of these 80000 tonnes around 10000 tonnes were used as fuel for processes such as energy
    generation  just think of the plastics that can be used in combustion processes to generate steam

10




     10 gain in expertise


     belgium remained the world number one for the recycling of
     ewaste in 2015 in the meantime recupels knowhow is being
     shared worldwide
     under the auspices of the united nations industrial development organization unido
     and in collaboration with amongst others the belgian ngo worldloop recupel in 2015
     once again supported solutions for environmental problems with ewaste in africa

     belgium is internationally recognised as a recycling leader for example in 2015 delegations came from japan
     romania latvia and other countries to learn from recupel


          in the meantime interest in recupels unique expertise extends far beyond
          belgiums borders




     in the partnership with worldloop as well it is above all recupels knowhow that is highly valued in 2015 recupel
     furnished the necessary expertise on collecting and processing discarded electrical and electronic equipment for
     setting up ewaste recycling centres in africa
