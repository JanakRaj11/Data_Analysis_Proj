                    initiative of the fine  specialty paper products operations which                           consequently we reduced co2 emissions from transportation as

                          the topic of modal shift was first raised around april 2013 as                        introducing modal shift
                    one of the key items on the agenda of a meeting on infrastructure
                    enhancement for the fine  specialty paper products business we
                    discussed what means of transport could replace conventional
                    truck transport and cut distribution costs after deciding to get
                    involved in modal shift as much as possible we examined various
                    means of transport using both land and sea routes and finally
                    selected roro ships
                          six months later in october 2013 the first roro ship loaded
                                                                                                                  securing goods in the cargo area of the truck to prevent them from collapsing left and securing the truck

   identifying routes for modal shift by checking                         railway container we are using for the route was developed as part
   the distribution data for each site                                    of the railway industrys modal shift measures and met our needs


the initiative drew the attention of the cost innovation office
headed by akio shimonabe
     the cost innovation office had taken various measures to reduce
transportation costs groupwide says shimonabe however in order
to comply with the act on the rational use of energy and respond to
the future decline in the population of truck drivers we had to review
our distribution methods drastically the initiative at the fine         improved transportation efficiency with the use of railway containers with a loading capacity equivalent

     csr workshops


     aggressive csr for the creation of

as the first series of csr workshops ended participants provided       every day
feedback including the following i became more aware of the
relationship between csr and business i realized that               i found the workshop very difficult but realized the
innovation is made through communication between various                importance of csr through the problemsolving process
                                                                        i got more and more involved in the subject each time

csr to face various issues each workshop was very rich in
content helping the participants to understand the essence of csr     i want to use what i learned in my work communication
and motivating them to practice csr in their workplaces                and opinion exchanges with people from other
    the lintec group will continue to provide workshops and other       departments will definitely be assets for me in the future
