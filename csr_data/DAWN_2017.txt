       environmental indicators is presented on pages 79 to 89

                                                   since the market crash of 2008 the company commenced
                                                   its turnaround programme in f2016 and progressed it in

       dawn and south africas economic landscape
       the south african economy has officially moved into a recession data from statistics south africa indicated that the first
       quarter contraction was led by weak manufacturing and trade with manufacturing falling by 37 and trade falling by 59 this
       suggests that high unemployment and stagnant wages are dragging down south africas longsuffering consumer sector

       political instability high unemployment and credit rating downgrades have also damaged business and consumer confidence in
       south africa the rand extended its losses against the dollar while government bonds also weakened


       dawns key actions during the year
       against this background the operational losses incurred in f2016 worsened in f2017 the board and management therefore
       focused diligently in the year under review on aspects which would ensure dawns sustainability these include continued
       focus on the following areas

            restructuring officer to the group in february 2017 the momentum of the turnaround plan which was started in the
            previous year was accelerated by edwin in his role as chief restructuring officer and will in the year ahead be further
            galvanised by his appointment as chief executive officer and his enhanced executive team

for this year following on the improved inflation outlook and the deteriorated growth outlook the repurchase rate was reduced
by 25 basis points to 675 per annum from 21 july 2017

in the first week of april 2017 standard  poors global ratings and fitch ratings both downgraded south africa to sub
investment grade in june 2017 moodys investors service downgraded south africa to baa3 one notch above subinvestment
grade

against this background of a slowing economy and with limited prospects of any significant improvement in domestic economic
conditions to stimulate consumer disposable income the trading environment is likely to remain constrained for the foreseeable
future

south africa is also experiencing the lowest business confidence levels seen in the last eight years  

the building confidence index after reaching its highest level in more than a year of 43 points in q1 2017 which is still 7 points
below equilibrium fell sharply to 32 points in q2 2017 moreover all of the subsubsectors measured registered a decline in
confidence this has only happened in five other instances since the index was first compiled in 1997 underpinning the fall in
confidence was a deterioration in building activity as well as a sharp drop in overall profitability continued low sales coupled
with rising input costs weighed significantly on industry profitability in q2 2017 the fall in construction activity is consistent with
an environment of constrained public sector capital expenditure

       chairmans report continued

       unless the economy deteriorates markedly in f2018 from current levels it is important for dawn to look past the challenging
       market conditions and to focus on regaining market share for the business model in particular to work optimally in the trading
       segment this will be achieved by strongly positioning the group as the master distributor of its product lines to target industries
       by refocusing the organisation on the basic principles and success factors upon which dawn was built the group has the
       opportunity to claw back market share and grow the bottom line similarly in the manufacturing segment the group is focusing
       on substantially increasing volume throughput and eliminating inefficiencies  refer to pages 17 and 18 of the chief executive
       officers reviews

       the turnaround plan has been cemented in strategies and converted into business plans in line with the groups new approach
       of decentralised management authority has been devolved to individual business units to ensure they can account for their
       profit performance to the executive committee on a monthly basis

       it is the boards intention that the implemented strategies discussed above be instrumental in bringing dawn back to
       profitability the turnaround process is gaining traction including a renewed focus on dawns core business through a backto
       basics approach

       the board however felt it prudent to draw attention to the timing risks of dawns turnaround as certain potential events
       and conditions could give rise to uncertainty that may cast doubt on the groups ability to continue as a going concern these
       potential events and conditions are set out in the chief financial officers report on page 20

       as announced on sens on 2 august 2017 dawn breached one of the financial covenants contained in the term sheet
       governing the groups banking facilities with absa bank limited based on engagements by the group to date absa bank
       limited has formally condoned the breach refer to page 25 of the chief financial officers report for further information


       appreciation
       i extend my deepest gratitude to my fellow board members for their unwavering support and guidance particularly through the
       restructuring reengineering and turnaround process their participation in a large number of additional meetings over and
       above the usual participation requirements of a board and their guidance and monitoring of the progress of the group during the
       year are very much appreciated i look forward to their continued strategic input as we steer dawn towards a new future

       many thanks and appreciation to our executive management team and all personnel who have done a great job in very tough
       conditions

       finally my appreciation goes out to all our stakeholders for their support in exceptionally trying circumstances

the chief executive officers review this year is split into a review from stephen connelly who managed the group from 1 june
2016 to 31 march 2017 as well as a forwardlooking review from edwin hewitt the new chief executive officer who was appointed
on 1 april 2017


                                        to better reflect the groups operations instead of reporting
                                        on the contribution of the building infrastructure and solutions
                                        segments to group results dawn now reports on the
                                        contributions of the trading and manufacturing segments
                                        the solutions segment has been integrated into the rest of the
                                        business



stephen connelly




review from the outgoing interim ceo stephen connelly
i became the interim chief executive officer on 1 june 2016 after derek tods retirement from the group at a point when the
economy was in a downward trajectory which worsened as the year progressed dawn was losing money in many areas
notably in sangio pipe incledon its associate grohe dawn watertech gdw and most of the african operations whs dpi
plastics and swan plastics were profitable but sales in these businesses started to reflect the pressure from the declining
economy and losses soon followed the first priority therefore was to stop the losses

it became clear that the tactic of chasing sales based on price particularly in dawns largest business whs was not working
 sales volumes did not improve and margins weakened the executive team did its best to reverse this but with limited
success given the culture of the business to sell mainly on price establishing a culture of accountability has also taken longer
than envisaged spending by dawns various customers continued to decline as the economy weakened during the 2017
financial year this in turn impacted dawns turnaround programme resulting in a longer implementation time and more
drastic action than previously anticipated

furthermore there had been an exodus of skills in the businesses particularly in incledon there were additional skills losses
during the year and in particular the loss of two of the three remaining executive directors shortly after the f2016 yearend as
a consequence of two reportable irregularities valuable institutional knowledge was thus lost to the business and needed to be
rebuilt in a very difficult trading environment in addition new managing directors were appointed at whs and incledon


snapshot of f2017
first half of the year
april to september 2016
the group incurred a r52 million operational loss in addition there was r286 million pretax in downsizing costs and
impairments due to the actions taken to rightsize the business and stop the losses

second half of the year
from october 2016 to march 2017
in the months of october and november 2016 the group posted operational profits but a further drop in sales pushed the
group back into losses for the remainder of the financial year and necessitated further remedial action the group incurred a
r65 million pretax operational loss in addition there was r63 million in further downsizing costs and impairments dawns
permanent cost base has been reduced by r125 million per annum excluding inflation over the past two years

impairments included those in heunis steel gdw and an onerous lease provision dawn also experienced cash constraints
due to the losses and the cash costs of the remedial action it became clear that a rights offer was required in order to ensure
the groups survival
                                                                                                                                            page

       chief executive officers reviews continued

       post yearend events
          proceeds of a r358 million rights issue were received which crucially gives management time to complete the turnaround
            and gives suppliers and customers confidence in the survival of the group
          new management appointed

                permanent chief executive officer  edwin hewitt

                new chief financial officer  chris booyens and

                new managing director at dpi plastics
          in april always a slow month due to the number of public holidays the group posted a loss but in may and june it posted
            profits once more
          gdw postponed reporting which delayed dawns results by two weeks to the middle of july 2017
          as advised in the cautionary announcement disseminated on sens on 11 july 2017 which cautionary announcement
            was renewed on 23 august 2017 the terms of the proposed transaction are still being negotiated regarding the potential
            disposal of dawns 49 holding in gdw it is the view of the dawn board that the transaction if successfully concluded
            will be a positive step in the turnaround process of the group


       appreciation
       i thank those employees who remained loyal to the group and continued to work hard despite the adverse circumstances we
       continued to implement difficult changes this year i realise these were hard with many of you seeing your colleagues leave
       thank you for your continued belief and commitment to the group

       to the executive management team i thank you for the long hours and huge effort you have put into working with me to turn
       dawn around

       to our customers and suppliers thank you for your support in difficult conditions please be assured that f2018 will be a year
       where you see dawn revert to its previous high standards of service

       with edwin hewitts appointment as chief executive officer in april 2017 i became executive deputy chairman of the group
       my new temporary role is to act as support and a soundboard for the executive team until december 2017 the board and i
       welcome edwins clearsighted focused nononsense approach to turning dawn around he has already made a clear impact
       on the business and i wish him and his team every success with phase two of the turnaround programme in f2018

                                           the group has been through a very difficult period with
                                           a severe decline in its markets and numerous internal
                                           issues to address however i believe the dawn business
                                           model is sound and as a new management team we
                                           are committed to doing everything possible to secure the
                                           groups turnaround



edwin hewitt




review from the incoming ceo edwin hewitt

introduction
i was appointed as the groups new chief executive officer after the f2017 yearend so my review focuses on what is currently
being implemented in the group as well as the outlook


turnaround update
as outlined in stephens review phase one of the turnaround focused on the downsizing closure and consolidation of
businesses to match the new sales reality this process is being continued in phase two together with restoring the business
fundamentals through a number of strategic interventions


1    decentralisation of the business and the appointment of new management
	after my appointment it quickly became apparent that a number of basic business premises were not in place most
  importantly the group lacked a culture of accountability this is being firmly addressing through the creation of defined
  business plans and budgets supported by focused weekly meetings tracking progress thereon and identifying whether
  corrective action is required to remain on track

	new managing directors have been appointed at whs incledon and dpi plastics these senior managers are highly
  capable individuals with significant experience and are able to take responsibility for the performance of their respective
  businesses


2    stabilising the balance sheet
	a core part of dawns turnaround strategy involves an aggressive focus on managing working capital including
  monitoring daily sales cash margins and stock

	the management team is mindful that dawn is obliged to meet the new bank covenants on ebitda and working
  capital outlined in the chief financial officers report the immediate focus remains on returning the group to sustainable
  profitability and progress has been made in this regard post f2017 yearend with most group businesses currently
  operating at breakeven or slightly better it is important to note that any further deterioration in the economy could result in
  a return to losses


3    increase efficiencies
      trading
      t
       he key to greater efficiencies and a recovery in the trading segment is to recoup lost market share through regaining
                                                                                                                                           page
      master distributor status increased efficiencies have to be implemented throughout the supplychain including the active
      management of volumerelated term agreements                                                                                         17

       chief executive officers reviews continued

       	being a master distributor is fundamental to dawns business model in dawns largest segment trading a number
         of issues led to the group losing this status over the past few years during the economic boom years leading up to the
         crash of 20082009 whs the single largest business in the group took a decision to wholesale multiple brands when
         their preferred local manufacturers could not keep up with whs customer demand as normality returned to the market
         whs continued with this practice competing with their traditional suppliers as a result traditional suppliers were forced
         to try and establish alternative routes to market resulting in the loss of dawns master distributor status

       	as the trading segments business model operates optimally on high sales volumes the effects of volume and related
         revenue declines as seen throughout f2017 exacerbated by the loss of master distributor status had a significantly
         negative effect on the business this reached breaking point when revenue turned sharply negative in the second half of
         f2017 as a result of the further decline in the economy the competition for a slice of the pie in a smaller market became
         extremely harsh and the group saw its volumedriven trade benefits decline this in turn impacted cash flows and put
         pressure on the groups ability to pay its creditors timeously at the same time the groups stock levels became bloated
         and imbalanced the restricted cash flows inhibited the ability to buy new stock which led to suppliers increasingly going
         around dawn direct to the customers further worsening revenue

             in addition the groups service efficiency slipped in f2017 however there is already a significant drive underway to
              improve levels of service including the restoration of supplier and customer relationships dawns distribution capability
              geographic reach storage capacity routetomarket development and ability to break bulk providing the customer with on
              timeinfull delivery otif is a key differentiator as a master distributor restoring a world class otif and credit funding
              executed efficiently will bring market share back to the group  

             f
              urthermore there is opportunity for a significant rationalisation of product across the group to decrease duplicated
             products and to ensure focus on specific partner brands

       	reducing the turnover of employees to less than 10 is a key element of the turnaround strategy staff turnover reached
         an unacceptable level of 30 during f2017 and with specific interventions has already improved to 21 post yearend
         the sales team is being reenergised through a revised reward and incentive plan clarified operating model updated
         product training and a strategic focus on customers and customer service as part of dawns marketing strategy the fleet
         of sales representative vehicles have been branded to increase dawns exposure and create awareness of the refreshed
         dawn brand

             manufacturing
              he groups manufacturing businesses are largely costinefficient with the exception of swan plastics there is more
             t
             scope for cost reduction

             t
              he focus on establishing worldclass manufacturing and production efficiencies is being promoted by the appointment of
             a technicallyaccomplished new managing director at dpi plastics one of his first priorities is to reengineer the factories
             to ensure lower factory breakeven points including reducing the pvc factorys breakeven point by at least 18

             it is important to make further inroads into the highermargin building fittings market to replace reduced government
              spend and to also increase the groups share of the hdpe market

             swan plastics is a lowcost very efficient pvc product manufacturer delivering good returns in a tough market


       4    understanding the issues through the eyes of our customers and suppliers
       	as mentioned above the restoration of supplier and customer relationships will be key to regaining the master distributor
         role since my appointment i have visited a large number of customers and suppliers to understand their issues and
         address their concerns

             b
              ased on the results of the august 2016 customer survey which were reconfirmed during a customer store tour in may
             2017 customers and suppliers really need and want dawn to fulfil the master distributor role this has reconfirmed that
             dawns business model is sound and the group has made good headway with restoring its master distributor status in
             the months postyearend

 awn provides access to quality brands and product ranges for its customers as well as optimal load delivery assisting
customers with working capital efficiencies through providing credit otif justintime delivery and providing product and
market insight and expertise management has renegotiated all major supply agreements to ensure the group works closely
with its customers to achieve synergies which will promote market and sales growth for the customer and dawn this will allow
dawn to once again add value to the customers business proposition and ultimately create a single point of procurement for its
brands

suppliers
 awn provides its suppliers with access to the market through a single channel by regaining master distributor status the
d
group will provide suppliers with pullthrough demand from dawns customers dawn also provides efficiencies on the route
to market a wide geographic footprint breakbulk services and the provision of credit to the smaller retailers dawn has
developed an expertise in credit provision which is a valuable advantage as most suppliers cannot carry this risk the provision
of all these services allows the groups suppliers to focus on their core businesses of manufacturing


conclusion
the restructuring and improvements already made together with the key strategic and operating initiatives implemented in the
last few months and those currently underway have ensured that the group is doing all it can to return to sustainable profitability

care has been taken to retain the groups geographic reach to ensure that when growth returns to the groups markets it is well
positioned to capitalise on the opportunities which will arise

as a management team the focus is firmly on delivering on the shortterm action plan to complete the turnaround and to
achieve at least a breakeven position in f2018 provided there is no further significant weakening of the economy  it should be
noted that the second half of the financial year is traditionally weaker as a result of seasonality and strikes are a risk if labour
negotiations cannot be concluded successfully

over the mediumterm the group will focus on achieving profitability in f2019 and meeting profit before interest and taxation
pbit margins in f2020 of 5 in the trading segment and 12 in the manufacturing segment


appreciation
on behalf of my management team i would like to thank all our employees in an extremely challenging working environment
your hard work on the turnaround and resilience are greatly appreciated

i am receiving exceptional support from the board and the management team above and beyond the call of duty and i thank
them

to our customers suppliers bankers and shareholders your continued support in difficult conditions is truly appreciated and we
look forward to a close working relationship with you going forward

as the new chief executive officer i reaffirm my and the management teams commitment to doing all we can to move dawn
along the road to sustainable recovery

         chris booyens




         introduction
         as described in the reviews of the chairman and chief executive officers growth in the economy remained subdued and then
         became significantly worse  in the second half of f2017 against the broader setting of a difficult global economic environment

         dawns performance was particularly badly hit from december 2016 due to the festive season period of subdued trading and
         the shrinking of the economy in the first quarter of 2017 by 07 against these conditions dawn posted a loss per share
         and headline loss per share for f2017 of 2692 f2016 3183 cents per share and 2405 f2016 656 cents per share
         respectively

         aftertax writedowns and impairments of r3522 million were recorded in f2017 following impairments of r6424 million in
         f2016

         the sustained adverse performance resulted in dawn having to approach shareholders for a rights issue of r358 million
         this year of which a r200 million portion was required to repay bridging finance and the balance to fund future operations in
         december 2016 dawn received r50 million bridging finance from absa bank limited absa this was repaid in january 2017
         after obtaining the proceeds from the sale of heunis steel a further repayment of r75 million was made to absa in april 2017
         to reduce the revolving credit facility to r100 million the facility extends until 31 march 2018 the overall focus remains on
         returning the group to sustainable profitability


         going concern assessment in context
         the board believes that the group is solvent and liquid for the 12 months following 14 july 2017 based on cash flow forecasts
         prepared and available facilities and therefore deemed the going concern basis of preparation appropriate the auditors
         pricewaterhousecoopers inc concurred with this view and issued an unmodified audit opinion on the annual financial
         statements for the year ended 31 march 2017

         the board however felt it prudent to draw attention to the timing risks of dawns turnaround as certain potential events and
         conditions could give rise to a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the groups ability to continue as a going
         concern these potential events and conditions include

            no further material deterioration in the economy

            the achievement of the forecast cash flow in an uncertain economy and

income statement

sales and gross margin
revenue for the full year declined by 139 comprising a 99 and 184 decrease in the first and second half of the year
respectively revenue at r43 billion for f2017 was down from around r50 billion rounded up in the previous financial year

cost of goods sold of r35 billion was down from r39 billion in f2016 and reflects the reduction in volumes offset by the
increase in unit costs the gross margin percentage declined by four percentage points to 180 volumes declined by 19

the lower margin together with the lower revenue resulted in gross profit decreasing from r11 billion in f2016 to r7775
million in f2017 a decrease of 290

the trading segment mainly comprising whs and incledon experienced a 19 decline in revenue to r31 billion f2016 r39
billion whs and incledon revenues declined by 10 and 38 respectively due to the depressed economy as well as lower
government spend on infrastructure and service levels

revenue from the manufacturing segment mainly comprising dpi plastics and swan plastics declined by 10 to r15 million
f2016 r16 billion with dpi plastics contributing a doubledigit decline following a decline in water infrastructure spend
margin deterioration in a very competitive market together with lower volumes remains a concern

       chief financial officers report continued


       finance charges
       net finance charges amounted to r586 million compared to r711 million in f2016 mainly due to the r340 million raised on

       costs amounted to r114 million classified as finance expenses interest paid to financiers at r460 million increased by 24

       revenue this together with cost and margin pressure resulted in a loss after tax of r1115 million dawns 49 share of this
       loss was r546 million

       loss before taxation amounted to r5684 million compared to last years loss of r7383 million

have confirmed to the independent regulatory board of auditors that these irregularities are not continuing full disclosure on
the matter was made in the 2016 annual financial statements


financial focus areas for f2018

funding future growth the cyclicality of funding requirements and the planned return of operations to profitable growth
necessitate access to appropriate and adequate funding facilities various funding options are being explored and facilities will
be structured to ensure future growth requirements are met

working capital management net working capital in the group comprises mainly accounts receivable as creditors are
expected to fund inventory as a result and despite the improvements in inventory and receivables achieved in f2017 the
working capital position is expected to remain tight working capital management continues to receive high focus and recent
improvements have resulted in a pleasing improvement to the groups borrowings

standardisation of business practices numerous legacy systems and disparate business practices resulted in a lack of
consistency throughout the group the erp implementation creates the opportunity to standardise on best practice and ensure
it is used to best advantage

taxation the complexity of the various types of taxation as well as a more aggressive stance by sars has elevated tax
compliance to a significant financial risk a structured approach will be followed to ensure compliance to all forms of taxation

covenants as announced on sens on 2 august 2017 dawn as at the june 2017 measurement date breached one of the
financial covenants contained in the term sheet governing the groups banking facilities with absa bank limited this is as a
result of the group lagging behind its budgeted profitability based on engagements by the group to date absa bank limited has
formally condoned the breach the group continues to work closely with its bank to maintain adequate funding facilities whilst
the turnaround plan is being executed

   production technology learnership and

   plastics manufacturing learnership

these learnerships include permanent employees and unemployed learners recruited as fixed term employees these
interventions form part of the transformation strategy apprenticeships are also underway at dpi plastics in order to create a
pool of competent trades within manufacturing this includes trades such as tool jig and diemakers atrami setters and
millwrights these are some of the trades considered as scarce skills within the industry

    going forward
    leadership and the implementation of a culture of a high performance organisation is the focus for human capital in the year
    ahead some of these elements cover the following

       ensuring dawn is an organisation that is well led through development and coaching of its leaders retention and
         recruitment of top leadership talent and ensuring that all leaders have line of sight of the dawn strategy

       building the organisation on clear behaviours that all staff believe in and align to ensuring that these behaviours are
         imbedded in the organisation and are not just spoken about

       creating a culture of passion for customers among all dawns people from sales to administrative staff

       embedding a sense of ownership and accountability amongst all staff by giving them line of sight of the dawn strategy and
         assisting them to see and be proud of their role in achieving that strategy

       having an engaged workforce by implementing the following

             management systems which reward and recognise high performance

             management systems that address unsatisfactory performance

             the organisation is considered an employer of choice

    carbon footprint
    for the year ended 31 march 2017 activities of dawns subsidiaries generated a carbon footprint of 47 529 co2e tonnes
    f2016 63 392 co2e tonnes this includes all activities under scope 1 and scope 2 as well as business travel under scope 3

    scope 1
    diesel and petrol jointly are the second most important energy carriers in the dawn group with 292 million litres of diesel
    f2016 393 million litres and 151 million litres of petrol f2016 138 million litres being used  resulting in 11 226 co2e
    tonnes from transport and distribution f2016 13 665 co2e tonnes diesel is primarily used in the transportation component
    of the distribution model to get manufactured goods to wholesale locations as well as to deliver wholesale goods to retail
    customers petrol is primarily used by sales personnel to promote and sell products a small amount of diesel is being used in
    factories and warehouses by forklifts based on low materiality 1 and insignificant changes in the installed equipment that
    cause fugitive emissions from previous periods refrigeration and airconditioning  a weighted average from the last three
    periods results in an estimate of 604 co2e tonnes for f2017

    historically the third most significant individual contributor to the carbon footprint was in the form of natural gas consumption
    however in f2017 no reporting companies used any natural gas

    scope 2
    the primary contributor to the carbon footprint emanated from scope 2 emissions in the form of electricity consumption of
    35 152 mwh f2016 46 702 mwh the solar pv plant has been excluded in this reporting period electricity is used at all
    of the 35 locations across the group with large consumption being recorded at particularly the pipe manufacturing locations
    reporting is based on the 17 subsidiary businesses

water
in f2016 water sources large roofed areas and a borehole have been identified at the ddc in germiston for the supply of
potable water produced on site a balance between production and use was established

during the year piping routes from roof catchment to a reservoir were determined and a borehole was drilled water quality
proved a challenge due to high levels of iron and other heavy metals the borehole delivered a yield of 18 kilolitre per day in
mitigation filtration treatment and pumping solutions were specified and sourced additionally a major water leak was identified
on site the fixing of this leak resulted in a significant portion of the water usage reduction on site which will be visible in future
periods

the filtration plant came into effect in may 2017 prior to this plant being operational and the unknown leak on site being fixed
germiston site was consuming approximately 90 000 litres of water per day upon rectification of the water leak consumption
dropped to approximately 70 000 litres per day

statement of responsibility and
approval by the board of directors
for the year ended 31 march 2017




the directors are required in terms of the companies act no 71 of 2008 to maintain adequate accounting records and are
responsible for the content and integrity of the annual financial statements and related financial information included in this
report it is their responsibility to ensure that the annual financial statements fairly present the state of affairs of the group as
at the end of the financial year and the results of its operations and cash flows for the period then ended in conformity with
international financial reporting standards the external auditors are engaged to express an independent opinion on the
annual financial statements

the annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs and
are presented in terms of the disclosure requirements as set out in the saica financial reporting guides as issued by the
accounting practices committee and financial reporting pronouncements as issued by the financial reporting standards
council the jse listings requirements and the requirements of the companies act 2008 the annual financial statements are
based upon appropriate accounting policies consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and
estimates

the directors acknowledge that they are ultimately responsible for the system of internal financial control established by the
group and place considerable importance on maintaining a strong control environment to enable the directors to meet these
responsibilities the board of directors sets standards for internal control aimed at reducing the risk of error or loss in a cost
effective manner the standards include the proper delegation of responsibilities within a clearly defined framework effective
accounting procedures and adequate segregation of duties to ensure an acceptable level of risk these controls are monitored
throughout the group and all employees are required to maintain the highest ethical standards in ensuring the groups business
is conducted in a manner that in all reasonable circumstances is above reproach the focus of risk management in the group
is on identifying assessing managing and monitoring all known forms of risk across the group while operating risk cannot be
fully eliminated the group endeavours to minimise it by ensuring that appropriate infrastructure controls systems and ethical
behaviour are applied and managed within predetermined procedures and constraints

the directors are of the opinion based on the information and explanations given by management that the system of internal
control provides reasonable assurance that the financial records may be relied on for the preparation of the annual financial
statements however any system of internal financial control can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss


going concern assessment
 awn posted losses for both the years ended 31 march 2016 and 2017 of r7629 million and r6374 million respectively
d
in determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the annual financial statements the directors are required to consider
whether the group can continue to operate as a going concern for the foreseeable future to 14 july 2018

 fter the rights issue in april 2017 dawn had banking facilities available of r200 million comprising a r100 million revolving
a
credit and a r100 million general banking facility to determine if the group will be a going concern for the next financial year
and up to 14 july 2018 management prepared cash flow forecasts for each of the material subsidiaries these forecasts were
subjected to further sensitivity tests and included the estimated intramonth peak funding requirements management also
considered the businesses ability to meet its financial obligations for the 12 months following approval of the annual financial
statements the analysis considered the current challenging market conditions which negatively affects the performance of the
group and managements turnaround plan being executed including a return to sustainable profitability further cost reductions
and optimisation of working capital the resulting cash flow projections were compared to available funding facilities the
forecast profitability and the ability of the underlying business to meet the forecasts is an area of uncertainty

 he effect of a further deterioration in the economic outlook and its potential impact on the groups cash flow and funding
t
facilities were also considered as an uncertainty

 he groups ability to fund its shortterm liquidity requirements is dependent on adequate funding facilities the forecasts
t
indicate that the covenants on the facilities are expected to be breached management is seeking clarification from their bankers
in this regard breaching covenants creates a risk for the group of losing its facilities



                                                                                                                                                 page

        art of managements plans to address this include the corporate restructuring activities and alternative funding options which
       p
       are being considered

        hese events and conditions give rise to a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the groups ability to
       t
       continue as a going concern and therefore that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal
       course of business

       as part of designing our audit we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated
       and separate financial statements in particular we considered where the directors made subjective judgements for example in
       respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently
       uncertain as in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including among other
       matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud

       materiality
       the scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality an audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance
       whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement misstatements may arise due to fraud or error they are
       considered material if individually or in aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
       users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements

       based on our professional judgement we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality including the overall group
       materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below these together with qualitative
       considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures and to
       evaluate the effect of misstatements both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole

        overall group materiality                    r21m

        how we determined it                         05 of consolidated revenue

                                                     we chose revenue as the benchmark because in our view it is currently the
                                                     most relevant benchmark in the dawn group and against which the performance
                                                     of the groups trading can be measured by users given the volatility in the
        rationale for the materiality                profit before tax number in the current  recent years under current economic
        benchmark applied                            conditions the revenue line is considered the driver of the trading business we
                                                     chose 05 which is lower than the normal quantitative materiality rule of thumb
                                                     used for profitoriented companies in this sector 1 given qualitative factors

how we tailored our group audit scope

we tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements as a whole taking into account the structure of the group the accounting processes and controls and the
industry in which the group operates

each financially significant component of the group was subject to a full scope audit of its financial reporting information
submitted to the company financially inconsequential components were also included in the group reporting scope as per
managements request these component audits and their materiality were aligned to their statutory work to avoid duplication of
audit effort in aggregate the full scope audits account for more than 98 of the consolidated revenue consolidated profit before
tax and consolidated total assets of the group

the group engagement team met with the component auditors of each of the significant components the team also engaged
with the remaining component auditors by means of an inspection of their working papers and required reporting documents
which included a comprehensive memorandum of work performed the group engagement team centralised the testing of the
liquidity and impairment assessments in order to obtain audit evidence in respect of components not part of the full scope audit
the group engagement team inspected the management accounts and performed analytical review procedures

key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
and separate financial statements of the current period these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the
consolidated and separate financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a
separate opinion on these matters

in addition to the matter described in the material uncertainty related to going concern section above we have determined the
matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report

other information
the directors are responsible for the other information the other information comprises the directors report the audit
committees report and the company secretarys certificate as required by the companies act of south africa and the other
information as contained in the integrated report which we obtained prior to the date of this auditors report other information
does not include the consolidated and separate financial statements and our auditors report thereon

our opinion on the consolidated and separate financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express
an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon

in connection with our audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements our responsibility is to read the other
information identified above and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
consolidated and separate financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated

if based on the work we have performed on the other information we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information we are required to report that fact we have nothing to report in this regard


responsibilities of the directors for the consolidated and separate financial statements
the directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated and separate financial statements in
accordance with international financial reporting standards and the requirements of the companies act of south africa and
for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated and separate financial
statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error

in preparing the consolidated and separate financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the group and the
companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group andor the company or to cease
operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so


auditors responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and separate financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our
opinion reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
isas will always detect a material misstatement when it exists misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these consolidated and separate financial statements

as part of an audit in accordance with isas we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit we also

   identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and separate financial statements whether due
     to fraud or error design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient
     and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
     higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations
     or the override of internal control

   obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
     the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the groups and the companys
     internal control

   evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
     disclosures made by the directors

          conclude on the appropriateness of the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit
            evidence obtained whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt
            on the groups and the companys ability to continue as a going concern if we conclude that a material uncertainty
            exists we are required to draw attention in our auditors report to the related disclosures in the consolidated and separate
            financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate to modify our opinion our conclusions are based on the audit
            evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report however future events or conditions may cause the group and  or
            company to cease to continue as a going concern

          evaluate the overall presentation structure and content of the consolidated and separate financial statements including
            the disclosures and whether the consolidated and separate financial statements represent the underlying transactions and
            events in a manner that achieves fair presentation

          obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within
            the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements we are responsible for the direction supervision
            and performance of the group audit we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion

       we communicate with the directors regarding among other matters the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant
       audit findings including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit

       we also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
       independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
       independence and where applicable related safeguards

       from the matters communicated with the directors we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the
       consolidated and separate financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters we describe these
       matters in our auditors report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when in extremely rare
       circumstances we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of
       doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication

       	subsidiaries are all entities including structured entities over which the group has control the group controls an
         entity when the group is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has
         the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date

            associates

            a
             ssociates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control generally accompanying a
            shareholding of between 20 and 50 of the voting rights

   	investments in associates are initially accounted for at cost and subsequently using the equity method of accounting
     whereby the carrying amount of the investment is increased or decreased to recognise the groups share of post
     acquisition profit and losses in the associate

   	accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies
     adopted by the group refer to page 215 for a list of the associates

            joint arrangements

   	the group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures a joint venture
     is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net
     assets of the joint venture the groups interest in jointly controlled entities is accounted for by applying the equity
     method in applying the equity method account is taken of the groups share of accumulated retained earnings and
     movements in reserves from the effective dates on which the companies became joint ventures and up to the effective
     dates of disposal the group does not recognise its share of profits or losses from the joint venture that result from the
     groups purchase of assets from the joint venture until it resells the assets to an independent party however a loss on
     the transaction is recognised immediately if the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of the
     current assets or an impairment loss

             nder the equity method the investment in joint ventures is initially recognised in the statement of financial position
            u
            at cost subsequent to acquisition date the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted with changes in the groups
            share of net assets of the joint venture goodwill relating to the joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the
            investment and is not amortised or separately tested for impairment the share of the results of operations of joint
            ventures is reflected in profit or loss this is the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of joint ventures and is
            therefore profit after tax and noncontrolling interests in the subsidiaries of joint ventures

   	accounting policies of joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies
     adopted by the group after application of the equity method the group determines whether it is necessary to recognise
     an impairment loss on the groups investments in joint ventures the group determines at each reporting date whether
     there is any objective evidence that the investments in joint ventures are impaired if this is the case the group
     calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of joint ventures and its carrying
     value and recognises the amount in profit or loss

   	upon loss of joint control over the joint venture the group measures and recognises any remaining investment at its fair
     value any difference between the carrying amount of the joint venture upon loss of joint control and the fair value of the
     retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss

            refer to page 215 for a list of the joint ventures

            common control transactions

            where applicable common control transactions are accounted for on a predecessor accounting basis


   13      broadbased black economic empowerment bbbee
   	shares were issued to ukhamba at par value during december 2004 these shares vested upon issuance the group
     elected to apply the exemption available in ifrs 1 to sharebased payment transactions the bbbee transaction with
     ukhamba was therefore not subject to the provisions of ifrs 2 as the rights to the shares were granted and vested prior
     to 1 january 2005

                     case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions and

                   all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity

       	on consolidation exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken
         to other comprehensive income if a foreign entity were to be sold such exchange differences would be recognised in
         the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale

       	subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only
         when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item
         can be measured reliably the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised all other repairs and maintenance
         are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred

     recognised immediately in profit or loss in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed

   	gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the entity sold

   	goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units for the purpose of impairment testing the allocation is made to those

         useful lives the useful lives of trademarks brand names customer relationships and software are assessed annually

         relationships useful lives have been estimated between five and ten years the software has an estimated useful life of
         between five and twelve years

       	the useful lives of the above assets are reviewed at each reporting period to determine whether events and
         circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for that asset if they do not the change in the
         useful life assessment from indefinite to finite will be accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate

       	subsequently impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
         indicate a potential impairment for indefinite life trademarks information used in posttax discount rates are sourced

                recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount the recoverable
                amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use

       	for the purposes of assessing impairment assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
         identifiable cash flows cashgenerating units the identified cashgenerating units are not bigger than the identified
         operating segments nonfinancial assets other than goodwill that could suffer potential impairment are reviewed for
         possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date

       	for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash
         generating units or groups of cashgenerating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination
         each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which
         the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level
         goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
         a potential impairment the carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount which is the higher of
         value in use and the fair value less costs to sell any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not

   19      financial instruments
            classification

            the group classifies financial assets and financial liabilities into the following categories

               financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

               loans and receivables

            c
             lassification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were obtained  incurred and takes place at
            initial recognition

             lassification is reassessed on an annual basis except for derivatives and financial assets designated as at fair value
            c
            through profit or loss which shall not be classified out of the fair value through profit or loss category

            financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

            financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are financial assets and liabilities held for trading

            t
             hese financial assets and liabilities are classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling or
            settling in the short term derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges

             ssets and liabilities in this category are classified as current assets and liabilities if they are expected to be settled
            a
            within 12 months otherwise they are classified as noncurrent

            derivative financial instruments

   	derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
     remeasured at their fair value the method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative
     is designated as a hedging instrument and if so the nature of the item being hedged

            the fair value of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes is disclosed in note 24

            cash flow hedge

             he effective portion of changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash
            t
            flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and are presented within equity in the hedge reserve the
            cumulative gain or loss in the hedge reserve is recognised in the consolidated income statement in the periods when the
            hedged item will affect the profit or loss ie when the underlying income or expense is recognised where the hedged

     reserve and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs if the underlying hedged
     transaction is no longer expected to take place the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in the hedge reserve

125    critical accounting estimates and judgements
        management makes judgements estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the financial statements that affect
        the disclosures and amounts of assets liabilities income expenses and equity

	estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including
  expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances

	the group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future the resulting accounting estimates will by
  definition seldom equal the related actual results the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing
  a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below

        estimated impairment of goodwill and intangible assets classified as having indefinite useful lives

         he group tests annually whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives have suffered any impairment in
        t
        accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 17 the recoverable amounts of certain cashgenerating units
        have been determined based on valueinuse calculations these calculations require the use of estimates note xx

        the group assesses on an annual basis whether the classification of indefinite life intangible assets is appropriate

        a
         s per the groups assessment goodwill trademarks and brand names are appropriately classified as indefinite life
        intangible assets

        demand forecasting impacting on working capital investment and impairment

	the group has made investment in working capital based on managements assumptions and estimates of future
  demand for the groups products and the customers ability to settle outstanding debts for credit sales when it becomes
  due

	impairment risk is managed through policies and provisions and raised based on various factors including age and
  quality of inventory and trade receivables

        fair value of derivatives and the financial instruments

         he fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation
        t
        techniques the group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based
        on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period the group used various methods as set out in note xx

        taxation

	judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes due to the complexity of legislation in various
  jurisdictions where the group operates there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax
  determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax
  audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due where the final tax outcome of these matters
  is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax
  provisions in the period in which such determination is made

         he group recognises the net future tax benefit related to deferred income tax assets to the extent that it is probable
        t
        that the deductible temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future assessing the recoverability of deferred
        income tax assets requires the group to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income
        estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax
        laws in each jurisdiction to the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates the
        ability of the group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the end of the reporting period could be impacted

        equitysettled schemes

        ifrs 2 adjustments are calculated based on option pricing models for the share option schemes in operation

	the impairment test for goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment identifies the recoverable amount
  of a cashgenerating unit determined based on valueinuse

	valueinuse calculations use pretax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management and
  cover a threeyear period pretax discount rates are used which equate to the cashgenerating units weighted average
  cost of capital the estimated growth rates applied are in line with that of the industry in which the cashgenerating unit
  operates and are materially similar to assumptions of external market sources the cashgenerating units recoverable
  amount is most sensitive to the growth rate assumptions applied growth rates for impairment testing purposes beyond
  three years were assumed at 6

	assumptions were based on managements past experience and best estimates regarding forecasts management
  determined budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations of market developments the
  discount rates used are pretax and reflect the appropriate risk associated with the industry and respective businesses

       	intangible assets with defined useful lives and property plant and equipment are tested for impairment if conditions are
         identified which might be indicative of a potential reduction in the value in use or net realisable value compared to its
         carrying value

               amortisation of intangible assets carried at defined useful lives

               intangible assets recognised as defined life intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation
                amortisation is calculated using the straightline method to allocate the cost of these assets over their useful lives
                trademarks are amortised over periods ranging from six to twenty years and customer relationship over periods ranging
                from five to ten years

                he impairment calculations were tested for sensitivity to significant changes in the key assumptions used the basis for
               t
               sensitivity testing was the budgeted operating profit used in the valueinuse calculation which was 10 and 20 lower

               if the budgeted operating profit used in the valueinuse calculation had been 10 or 20 lower in the cashgenerating
                units this would have resulted in impairments over intangible assets and property plant and equipment as follows

                inventory balances are presented at the lower of cost and net realisable value

       	the cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in inventories expensed during the year amounted to
         r33 billion 2016 r36 billion note 4 a writedown of inventories of r1379 million 2016 r519 million was recognised
         in cost of sales the writedown was necessitated by the slowdown in the economy and the rate of sales of products various
         south african and other african branches were closed which also contributed to the writedowns the group entered into
         a programme of rationalising product ranges by reducing the variety of product lines and focussing on core suppliers and
         products

                 he fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example overthecounter derivatives

                an instrument are observable the instrument is included in level 2 if one or more of the significant inputs is not based on
                observable market data the instrument is included in level 3

                specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include

                   quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments

                   the fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on
                     observable yield curves

                   the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the statement
                     of financial position date with the resulting value discounted back to present value

                   other techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis are used to determine fair value for the remaining
                     financial instruments

                all of the resulting fair value estimates are included in level 2

         plastics proprietary limited of dch engaged in a market allocation arrangement with sangio pipe proprietary limited
         sangio in which dch had a 49 interest at the time

       	in such cases penalties are usually determined as a percentage of affected turnover and affected turnover is usually
         that related to the market allocation arrangement in question the ultimate penalty will be judged across a number of
         variables and parameters that are in the judgment of the tribunal

                this analysis assumes that all other variables in particular interest rates remain constant

       	a 10 percent strengthening of the rand against the above currencies as at 31 march would have had the equal but
                opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above on the basis that all variables remain constant
                the concentration of risk in respect of foreign currencies is considered low the lack of liquidity experienced in the
                african countries had a negative effect on the availability of currency for repatriation and repayment of foreign obligations
                as well as the availability of hedging instruments in the affected foreign countries alternative hedging mechanisms were
                deployed to assist in the foreign exchange management

                cash flow and fair value interest rate risk

       	the groups interest rate risk arises from longterm borrowings borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group
                to cash flow interest rate risk borrowings incurred at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk the
                groups borrowings are denominated mainly in rand and mainly at variable interest rates

       	the effective interest rates on bank overdrafts are disclosed in note 23 interest rates on other borrowings are disclosed

       counterparty as published by a recognised rating agency no investment will be made with any counterparty with a short
       term national rating of lower than p1 moodys a1 sp f1 fitch

      flows from the operations to which they relate where possible

      there is currently a concentration of liquidity risk as a result of the restructured debt position and transactional banking

      to do so the group established facilities for specialised assetbased finance with financial institutions to reduce
      concentration risk

       	after the rights issue in april 2017 dawn had banking facilities available of r200 million comprising a r100 million
         revolving credit and a r100 million general banking facility to determine if the group will be a going concern for the next
         financial year and up to 14 july 2018 management prepared cash flow forecasts for each of the material subsidiaries
         these forecasts were subjected to further sensitivity tests and included the estimated intramonth peak funding
         requirements management also considered the businesses ability to meet its financial obligations for the 12 months
         following approval of the annual financial statements the analysis considered the current challenging market conditions
         which negatively affects the performance of the group and managements turnaround plan being executed including
         a return to sustainable profitability further cost reductions and optimisation of working capital the resulting cash flow
         projections were compared to available funding facilities the forecast profitability and the ability of the underlying
         business to meet the forecasts is an area of uncertainty

                 he effect of a further deterioration in the economic outlook and its potential impact on the groups cash flow and funding
                t
                facilities were also considered as an uncertainty

       	the groups ability to fund its shortterm liquidity requirements is dependent on adequate funding facilities the forecasts
         indicate that the covenants on the facilities are expected to be breached management is seeking clarification from their
         bankers in this regard breaching covenants creates a risk for the group of losing its facilities

       	part of managements plans to address this include the corporate restructuring activities and alternative funding options
         which are being considered

                 hese events and conditions give rise to a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the groups ability to
                t
                continue as a going concern and therefore that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the
                normal course of business
