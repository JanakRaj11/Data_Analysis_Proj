one stamped letter per month
postal services are facing a major transformation in europe as digitization reduces mail delivery volumes
substantially lower volumes strict regulations and the general rise in costs are significantly increasing the unit
costs of the delivered products todays mail delivery volumes are 30 percent lower than five years ago

posti is the only operator in finland to provide fiveday delivery services that cover the entire country the
universal service obligation covers the entire country with the exception of the åland islands the finnish
communications regulatory authority supervises compliance with the obligation

following the amendments to the finnish postal act in june 2016 the entire postal market is now open to free
competition this means that postis competitors are allowed to deliver mail anywhere and at any time without
a specific delivery day obligation posti however is still subject to the fiveday delivery obligation throughout
the country which puts posti on unequal footing with regard to competition with the other players in the
market

postis universal service obligation currently covers a very small share of all postal items namely letters and
postcards paid by stamps in 2016 posti delivered some 21 billion items in total of this amount
approximately 109 million items less than 6 percent were covered by the universal service obligation
christmas cards accounted for 28 million of these christmas cards are sent over a period of just a few weeks

finns currently receive an average of approximately 11 stamped letters per year or about one letter per
month the lower the volume of mail delivered the higher the costs for each item things must be done
differently to keep costs under control otherwise maintaining the universal service in the future will be under
threat financially the second phase of the reform of the postal act is underway with new amendments
expected to enter into force in june 1 2017

during the year posti delivered items that fall within the scope of the universal service obligation on five
weekdays to all households in accordance with the postal act in areas that are difficult to reach posti
deviated from the fiveweekday obligation in the case of approximately 91 households with the maximum
allowed number being 300 posti processed 1910 inquiries related to normal letters during the year of these
inquiries 652 were unresolved 456 items were declared as having been lost while 802 lost items were found
inquiries related to letter items represented 000024 percent of the total volume

the company has restricted its tax reporting to only cover substantial operating countries based on this
decision countryspecific tax information is only presented for finland and russia nearly 85 of the groups
net sales comes from these countries according to the groups strategy these countries are its main markets
other operating countries are grouped under scandinavia and other countries posti also uses the same
geographical categorization in its consolidated financial statements

for countries other than finland and russia information is presented on a country groupspecific basis as the
information reported is not of material importance and the presentation of countryspecific information might
jeopardize the nondisclosure of confidential information such as customer or pricing details from the groups
perspective the amount of information reported is not of material importance when the taxes payable for an
individual country do not exceed eur 5 million

the group operates in ten countries in addition posti has companies in countries where the group no longer
has business operations when assessing the materiality threshold net sales of eur 1 million for each
individual subsidiary is considered the threshold for nonmateriality nonmaterial companies are excluded
from the reporting as the amount of taxes paid by the companies is minor in proportion to the figures
disclosed by the group these companies are in the categories scandinavia and other countries

posti does not have any operations in countries classified as tax havens where the corporate income tax rate
is significantly lower than the finnish corporate tax rate the information presented below is based on the
financial statements of separate companies and the information has not been consolidated except net sales

basis to support the development of its operations in 2016 posti developed its indicators of customer
satisfaction some of the indicators were implemented in fall 2016 some in early 2017 due to the extensive
changes in this area comprehensive data is not available for the year 2016

the goal is to quickly obtain concrete feedback on specific transactions ongoing automated questionnaires
produce more accurate data than traditional interviews conducted less frequently when feedback can be
linked to specific transactions corrective actions are easier and faster to take

posti currently has approximately 15 measurement points linked to specific transactions the plan is to
increase the number of measurement points going forward this represents a significant investment in the
continuous collection and utilization of data on the customer experience projectspecific customer satisfaction

focus is on the customersupplier relationship or in other words what posti is like as a partner

maintaining health and work ability
posti introduced the omatyöterveys telephone service in the fall to harmonize practices and help employees
maintain their health and work ability a corresponding service was previously piloted for one year following
positive feedback from both employees and supervisors a corresponding common practice was implemented
for all of the personnel the telephone service involves health care professionals assessing the employees
situation providing healthrelated counseling granting shortterm sick leave and if necessary referring the
employee to occupational health care the new service means that employees do not need to travel while sick
to visit occupational health care

in order to harmonize procedures the esimieskompassi supervisor compass system was made available to
all postis supervisors in fall 2016 to support the management of absences and work ability a corresponding
system was previously piloted for one year the feedback was positive and the work ability management
system has provided concrete support in the daytoday management of work ability

in addition to occupational health care services posti provides a diverse range of wellbeing services to
employees they include various sports and fitness services support for independent physical exercise as well
as support for workplace meals since 2006 posti has also had its own foundation for wellbeing at work
that is tasked with promoting the psychological and physical health of employees the foundations
operations are divided into measures improving wellbeing at work and research activities the foundation
organizes various sporting events fitness overhaul campaigns and active family vacations

postis environmental management is based on environmental management standards particularly iso
14001 as well as legal and official requirements and the uns global compact principles and sustainable
development goals sdgs postis quality and environmental policy covers all countries of operation

environmental issues are discussed both in the management board and the audit committee at least once a
year as part of more extensive corporate responsibility reporting the targets for environmental work are
determined by the corporate responsibility steering group the business groups determine more detailed
operating programs as part of their management model

employees awareness of environmental issues is promoted through training and employee orientation as part
of the iso 14001 management system environmental issues are also regularly discussed in the channels of
internal communication at the end of 2016 certified environmental management systems covered 83
percent 2015 88 percent of the groups personnel the warehouses in russia also follow an environmental
management system pursuant to iso 14001

postis environmental program aims to reduce carbondioxide emissions by 30 percent by 2020 in proportion
to net sales compared to 2007


improving energy efficiency
posti was among the first to join the new energy efficiency agreement period 20172025 the agreement is a
voluntary commitment to improve energy efficiency posti signed the agreement for the second time now

posti aims to reduce the energy consumption of its facilities by 105 percent during the review period 2014
2025 the relevant measures concern the properties with the highest rates of energy consumption in many
locations lighting technology about to become obsolete was replaced with led lights during 2016 the work
will continue in 2017 changes to lighting control have also been carried out at many locations lighting is
responsible for nearly 60 percent of the energy consumption in postis facilities


1920 solar panels on the roof of the logistics center in vantaa
posti uses only green electricity and in the future part of it will be produced by posti itself last winter posti
mounted 1920 solar panels on the roof of its vantaa logistics center the nominal power of the plant is 500
kw its calculated annual output is 450000 kw this is equal to the annual consumption of approximately 25
detached houses posti uses all of the energy itself because the logistics center operates around the clock


to ensure sustainable development posti has undertaken to
    comply with all applicable environmental laws and standards including iso 14001
    reduce the fuel consumption of its vehicles
    reduce the energy consumption of its facilities
    improve recycling and reduce landfill waste
    consider environmental aspects in sourcing subcontracting and investment decisions

    ensure sufficient resources for maintaining and continually improving its environmental operations and
    report its environmental impact annually and provide employees with information and the opportunity to
    operate in an environmentally efficient manner




recycling of work clothing
in the spring of 2016 posti began to recycle valuable and usable work clothing extra usable work clothing is
sent to the warehouse of the work clothing supplier where the clothing is washed repaired and labelled and
recycled in the warehouse recycled work clothing is placed on top of the piles when ordering new work
clothing recycled clothing is always received first for now work clothing that is unfit for recycling ends up
being utilized in energy production or as mixed waste


up to 99 percent of waste already recovered
posti has centralized its waste management services to a single operator in finland this ensures energy
efficiency and costeffectiveness the aim of waste management is to increase the amount of recoverable
waste and minimize landfill waste posti aims to improve the recovery rate by one percent every year in 2016
the recovery rate was already at 99 percent 2015 98 percent and the recycling rate was 66 percent each
of postis iso 14001 certified operating locations has a documented waste management plan it includes a
list of what waste fractions the property collects related operating models and illustrations of the placement
of waste containers at the property the volumes of waste per fraction are presented in more detail under

the vast majority approximately 85 percent of postis carbondioxide emissions in finland arise from
transports and vehicle emissions as the largest transport and delivery company in finland posti plays a major
role in the development of ecofriendly and energy efficient transportation systems the environmental
efficiency of transport operations is improved primarily by planning routes efficiently ensuring a high
utilization rate combining deliveries and driving in an environmentally responsible manner

postis fleet of nearly 3900 commercial vehicles in finland recorded a total of 114 million kilometers in 2016
2015 108 million km postis subcontractors logged in roughly 80 million kilometers 2015 85 million km

posti is a pioneer and participates actively in the trials of alternative fuels postis fleet includes some 40
biogas vehicles that run on the 100percent renewable finnish gasum biogas its use does not generate fine
particulate matters harmful to health and the greenhouse gas emissions during the fuels life cycle are minor

mail is also delivered on bicycles and on foot every day around 1800 delivery routes  approximately 36
percent of all routes  are gone through with delivery bikes and delivery carts on foot the majority of these
are eassist bikes and carts

increasing the number of electric cars in delivery is challenging electric cars that are compatible with the
winter conditions in finland and meet the criteria set by every aspect of delivery have so far not been
available on the market the car must be able to transport enough load and to operate at least reasonable
routes without recharging in between also in winter conditions the lack of extensive network is a challenge
itself


significant cost benefits through the improvement of utilization rates
significant changes in the operating model and the use of vehicles took place in 2015 the same strategy
continued to be implemented in 2016 the same vehicles are used to carry mail parcels and freight the fleet
is renewed continuously to respond to changing needs the utilization rates of vehicles have improved
considerably due to route optimization and the combining of transports posti engages in active development
work to increase the fleets utilization rate

the improved utilization rate has brought cost benefits through lower vehicle costs and the vehicles reduced
fuel and servicing costs in delivery vehicles the average consumption of fuel has increased despite good
driving habits and more advanced engine technology the vehicles loading rates and the weights of the
transported loads have increased these have a direct impact on fuel consumption


economic and safe driving habits make a difference
since 2015 every vehicle in postis own use has been equipped with a system that monitors driving habits the
system is a daily tool in production activities including supervisory work planning and operations
management in the spring of 2016 driving habit monitoring devices were fitted into more than 400 trailers
these collect data on the kilometers driven as well as telematics and gps data which are used in periodic
servicing and dispatching

since the rollout of the system posti has successfully reduced fuel and servicing costs it has also been
successful in improving occupational safety the number of traffic accidents has declined particularly the
number of accidents involving personal injuries the trend in insurance statistics has been positive the number
of traffic accidents has reduced and the damage repair costs have fallen

the scope of the monitoring now covers approximately 8000 people every driver receives a regular report or
a link through which to print a report on their own driving habits the report allows drivers to monitor the
development of their driving habits a personal driving habit index helps drivers to develop a more economic
way of driving ecodriving and promote safe driving habits if necessary driving habits are intervened in
according to the process

the data collected with the driving habit monitoring devices and the usage targets are developed actively
development targets include the safety of production efficiency quality customer experiences and new
services


posti green
since 2011 posti has provided its customers with carbon neutral mail delivery at no extra cost in 2015 posti
expanded the posti green product portfolio to cover the parcel and logistics business in addition to postal
services posti green services are part of postis environmental program

climate change is a global issue postis industry is very large and the company wants to contribute to
mitigating climate change while serving as an example of sustainability to others using posti green products
allows customers to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of their supply chain processes and communicate the
environmental responsibility of their operations to their customers

arranging zerocarbon transport services is practically impossible emissions are necessarily created in spite of
postis continuous efforts to reduce co2 emissions from transport for example by optimizing routes
combining transports and ensuring economical driving


certified climate projects
transporting a letter generates around 28 grams of carbon dioxide and transporting a parcel generates
approximately 700 grams posti offsets its emissions balance by participating in certified climate projects the
projects ensure that a corresponding amount is cut from carbon dioxide emissions somewhere else

the projects posti is involved in include wind power projects in india and turkey the renewable energy
generated by the farms reduces emissions by replacing fossil fuels the projects also have a regional job
creation effect


posti green service model
all of postis services in finland are carbon neutral posti green services that generate no emissions for
customers the productspecific posti green calculation process and customer reporting was verified by a third
party in summer 2016
