      3 about gas


      natural gas

      consisting of almost pure methane natural gas is sourced from natural gas and oil deposits as well as shale rock natural gas is
      odorless tasteless and nontoxic and it does not contain sulfur fine particulate matter or heavy metals carbon dioxide
      emissions from natural gas are lower than from oil or coal natural gas has a net calorific value ncv of 10 kwhm3 which
      corresponds to the ncv of one liter of light fuel oil



      natural gas has a multitude of uses industrial facilities utilize natural gas as a fuel as well as a raw material and natural gas
      provides a high rate of efficiency in combined heat and power chp production natural gas can be used in many industrial
      processes to generate for example heat and electricity while in the process industry natural gas can be utilized as a raw
      material homes and restaurants use natural gas for heating and cooking in compressed and liquefied form natural gas is also
      an excellent shipping and road transport fuel




      lng

      liquefied natural gas lng is natural gas converted into liquid form by cooling it to 162 c as a fuel the properties of lng are
      equal to those of natural gas in the liquid state lng only takes 1600 of the volume of gas in the gaseous state this is why lng
      can be stored transported and used conveniently and costeffectively lng is an environmentally friendly energy source that
      meets the maritime transport emission limits that entered into force in the baltic sea in january 2015 like natural gas lng is
      odorless tasteless and nontoxic and it does not contain sulfur fine particulate matter or heavy metals using lng helps cut
      carbon dioxide emissions by up to 25 compared with petroleum products



      lng is currently utilized in industry as well as shipping and heavyduty road transport lng enables the delivery of gas outside
      the gas pipeline network




      biogas

      biogas is a 100 local and renewable energy source the composition of raw biogas varies depending on the production method
      and feedstocks used feedstocks that can be used to produce biogas include various types of biodegradable waste such as
      municipal and industrial waste as well as sewage sludge raw biogas is upgraded to a composition that is equal to natural gas
      and biogas can be used for all the same purposes as natural gas the net calorific value of upgraded biogas is around 10
      kwhm3



      at the moment biogas is used in finland in electricity and heat production industrial facilities home heating cooking and as a
      transport fuel the existing gas pipeline network is used to transmit biogas from production facilities to customers biogas can
      also be liquefied this is when it is referred to as liquefied biogas lbg lbg can be delivered outside the gas pipeline network



      the production of renewable synthetic natural gas sng is also currently under development renewable sng can be produced
      by gasifying biomass such as wood biosng or through electrolysis from renewable electricity esng



      biogas production also enables nutrient recycling as the nutrient residues from the process can be utilized as fertilizers for
      purposes such as agriculture using recycled fertilizers reduces the need to use conventional artificial fertilizers

      cleaner energy through nordic gas ecosystem
      g41 g427



      the paris agreement on climate change adopted in 2016 seeks to curb global warming the european unions climate targets
      are becoming more and more ambitious and the new national energy and climate strategy outlines finlands energy future
      developments such as the decision taken by the international maritime organization imo to designate the baltic sea and the
      north sea as sulphur emission control areas seca are also part of a broader trend

      the stricter emission targets emphasize the role of clean gas solutions in the changing energy system and gas plays a key role
      in our journey towards carbonneutral society natural gas can help reduce the use of coal in combined heat and power chp
      production and promote not only cuts in carbon dioxide and local emissions but also selfsufficiency in electricity production lng
      is a costefficient substitute for more polluting petroleumbased fuels for industries outside the gas pipeline network as well as
      for maritime and road transport the production of renewable biogas is a key element in resourcewise circular economy and
      existing gas infrastructure and uses can be utilized efficiently with biogas as well

      biogas production is based on the utilization of biodegradable waste and several circular economy and nutrient cycling
      innovations have already been created around the process as a fully renewable energy solution biogas also supports the un
      sustainable development goals




      agenda 2030  sustainable development goals



      the new sustainable development goals sdgs and agenda 2030 for sustainable development were adopted by the un in
      2015 the sdgs took effect from the beginning of 2016 in february 2017 the government gave its report to parliament on the
      implementation of agenda 2030 in finland in line with the government priorities implementation in finland builds on two
      themes the aims set for finland by 2030 are carbon neutrality and resource wisdom as well as nondiscrimination equality and
      competence

      gasum has an impact on society stakeholders and the environment directly through our operations as well as through the
      supply chain in line with our strategy we promote sustainable development and therefore also support the sdgs and the above
      mentioned aims of the finnish government

      a key tool in the implementation of agenda 2030 is societys commitment to sustainable development which gasum joined in
      2016 with two objectives

             expanding the biogas market to the terawatthours range by 2025
             investing in the development of the road fuel gas market by increasing the supply of road fuel gas significantly in the key
             demand areas in finland

      integrated management system


      the gasum group adheres to a single integrated management system ims that covers our certified quality iso 9001
      environmental iso 14001 energy iso 50001 and safety and security ohsas 18001 management systems as well as the
      sustainability scheme for the transport use of biofuels

      the integrated management system consists of systematic approaches that translate decisions made by our senior
      management into practical operations the system is applied to all gasum group companies and operations excluding skangas
      and for the time being also in part the biogas plant operations acquired in 2016 as well as products and services sold by the
      group system conformity is evaluated annually through internal audits as well as audits conducted by an external organization
      recertification takes place every three years

      the integration of the new biogas plant operations into the integrated management system has begun with the expansion of the
      sustainability scheme for biogas sold for road fuel use to also cover the riihimäki biogas plant and lnglcng filling stations the
      energy authority issued its decision on the matter in november 2016 in the sustainability scheme emission savings for biogas
      are calculated in comparison with fossil fuels and the compliance of origin of raw materials with the sustainability criteria is
      verified

      upgraded biogas meets the sustainability criteria set in the sustainability scheme in addition a quality system in accordance
      with the iso 9001 standard was drawn up for the biogas plant operations of gasum biotehdas oy and integrated into the gasum
      integrated management system in 2016 the system was audited externally in december 2016

      skangas has a separate quality system certified in accordance with iso 9001 skangas has also drawn up an environmental
      management system in accordance with the iso 14001 and system certification is due for completion in early 2017

      7 carbonneutral future and innovations




      towards a carbonneutral future


      our aim is to promote development towards a carbonneutral future together with our partners versatile gas plays a key role in
      the achievement of this objective

      the implementation of gasums strategy requires strong research and development activity focusing on biogas production the
      efficient utilization of collected information will also be increasingly important for a service provider to respond to this need we
      raised digitalization as on our main themes for the future in 2016

      the circular economy plays a key role in action against climate change and efforts to save natural resources gasums national
      network of biogas plants is a model example of circular economy implementation gasum processes biodegradable waste and
      produces renewable energy and recycled nutrients



      our carbonneutral future and innovations theme consists of four aspects

             emissionreducing solutions
             expansion of the gas market
             competitiveness of gas
             development of new business models and partnerships

                                                                                                                                           31

      gasums research and development focus areas
      gasum1


      the focus of our research and product development is on biogas production biogas is currently produced at all of gasums
      plants using anaerobic technology the production process yields nutrientrich digestates  an interesting area of research for
      circular economy promotion research is also required in the field of logistics as biogas production taking place at small units
      increases the need of transport the transport of gas in compressed and liquefied form lng lbg has also become more
      common increasing interest in research in this field


      biogas production

      at gasum biogas plants production is based on anaerobic technology where gas is produced from organic matter using
      anaerobic digestion this method is efficient and wellsuited for a variety of waste fractions potential new feedstocks are being
      studied continuously to develop production

      biogas can also be produced using gasification technology in this various lignocellulosic materials are used as feedstocks the
      product obtained through gasification is called biosynthetic natural gas biosng there are many national and international
      projects underway on topics including looking into ways of decreasing the price of gas produced using this technology


      gasrelated circular economy

      the circular economy is closely related to the production of anaerobic biogas where biodegradable waste is processed into
      biogas and nutrients nutrients are recovered by separating them from the digestates generated in the biogas process that can
      therefore also be referred to as nutrient residues

      there are many potential uses for nutrient residues obtained from the process such as replacing artificial fertilizers circular
      economy research seeks to establish how nutrients could be separated and how any undesirable substances can be removed


      gas transport and logistics

      gas used to be transported mainly via the transmission network located in southern finland this meant the use of gas also
      concentrated in the area covered by the pipeline network biogas is produced in areas outside the transmission network which
      has expanded the opportunities to access and use gas this development has been mainly facilitated by the fact that the
      transport of gas in containers in the compressed form and the liquefied form lng lbg has become more common

      this change has resulted in the role of maritime as well as heavyduty road transport logistics control becoming increasingly
      important research is being conducted to produce information on how the production and transport network can be managed
      efficiently using new methods

      special attention has been paid in the lng business on producing safety improvements in bunkering equipment


      distributed energy solutions promoting gas use

      feedstocks required for biogas production are available from industrial municipal and agricultural sources in our operating
      countries which often means they need to be transported biogas production yields digestates the types and uses of which
      depend on the feedstock making this system work requires a partnership formed by several actors  an industrial ecosystem in
      this it is crucial to be able to establish linkages between data concerning the collection site of the waste the content of the waste
      and the composition of the digestate

      research into biogas ecosystems helps increase our understanding of the conditions required for the creation of the ecosystem
      and the factors motivating the players involved


      gasbased energy storage technology

                                                                                                                                                  32

gasums corporate responsibility 2016  cleaner tomorrow



      energy systems will become more energyefficient and at the same time more diverse which means the production portfolio is
      expanding there are already areas in the world where solar energy is regionally competitive in addition the production of solar
      energy is focused on the daytime  while residential energy use mainly takes place in the evenings this means the use of
      renewable energy will also call for flexibility in the energy system increasing the importance of issues such as storage

      research is employed to study how storage technology can be developed and how energy can be stored in the gaseous form
      examples of this include powertogas projects conducting research into the production of hydrogen with solar or wind power
      and its further processing into methane




      research networks and activities in 2016


      gasum has partnerships with finnish research institutions
      and enterprises as part of a national research network

      research has taken place in many research programs of clic
      innovation ltd in the sustainable bioenergy solutions for
      tomorrow best program gasum has studied smallscale
      biogas production and the formation and functioning of
      biogas ecosystems the objective of the efficient energy use
      efeu program was to explore energyefficient energy
      systems of the future in this program gasum participated in
      the development of tools for distributed gas production and
      usage logistics in addition information has been produced
      about the energyefficiency of biogas in relation to other
      propulsion alternatives in transport




      gasum is a cofunder of finlands first powertox pilot facility at the pilot facility solar electricity is used to produce hydrogen in
      a process where water is split by means of electrolysis the resulting hydrogen can be combined with carbon dioxide obtained
      from air and these two gases can then be converted to for example methane

      gasum was also a member of the european gas research group gerg in 2016 research questions shared by the gas sector
      are considered in cooperation with other enterprises exchange of views with other enterprises is an important part of
      development activity

      a new method introduced in research and product development is cooperation with customers and feedstock suppliers and
      handlers




      gasum gas fund


      we support national research development and innovation every year through the gasum gas fund the gas fund is one of the
      special funds administered by the finnish foundation for technology promotion tes in 2016 16 grants were given out from
      the fund totaling 108000 2015 49000

      steps forward taken in gas market expansion
      gasum2


      a key objective of the gasum strategy is to expand the gas market based on natural gas liquefied natural gas lng and biogas
      in the nordic countries some of the steps forward taken in 2016 gas market expansion are described below


      filling station network expanded

      in response to growing demand for road fuel gas gasum has launched an investment program for 35 new filling stations we
      are developing a road fuel gas filling station network that enables the use of lng in heavyduty transport and provides access to
      compressed road fuel gas for cars in new areas the deployment of the first four lng filling stations intended specifically for
      heavyduty vehicles began in 2016 with the opening of lnglcng stations in turku and helsinki


      pori lng terminal taken into use

      the gasum subsidiary skangas took finlands first lng import terminal in tahkoluoto pori into use in august 2016 the opening
      of the terminal resulted in an increase in the sales of the lng business unit the business unit entered into several new
      agreements on the supply of lng in the nordic countries for industrial as well as maritime transport customers


      lng production plant acquired by gasum subsidiary

      skangas as acquired the norwegian risavika lng production plant from the lyse group in april the transaction strengthened
      the position of the lng business unit in the lng value chain and as a major player in the nordic countries


      strong growth continued in biogas business

      gasums biogas production capacity was increased considerably by the acquisition of the biogas plants of biotehdas and
      biovakka that took place in early 2016 today gasum produces biogas and processes biodegradable waste at a total of 7 biogas
      plants in finland the newly acquired biogas plants improve our opportunities to offer biogas to industrial and transport
      customers particularly in areas outside the gas pipeline network


      biogas production on the increase
      og3

      in 2016 gasum injected 80000 mwh of biogas into the gas network gasums biogas production at plants outside the pipeline
      network in finland totaled around 116000 mwh in 2016

      gasums renewable energy produced from biomass ie biogas amounted to 192000 mwh in 2016 the riihimäki biogas plant
      produces biogas and this gas is injected into the gas network the plants production is only included once in the calculation of
      the total amount biogas volumes have increased significantly following the biotehdas and biovakka acquisitions

                                                                                                                                          34

      competitiveness of gas
      gasum4

      in finland the competitiveness of natural gas has for a long time been reduced by finnish energy taxation and the low market
      prices of coal emission allowances and electricity which have provided steering away from gas use in combined heat and power
      chp production in particular this has resulted in the use of gas in chp mainly as a peak balancing fuel especially during cold
      spells

      with tax rates on fossil fuels being raised further demand will be steered towards renewable fuels according to finnish and
      international climate targets the amount of renewable energy will increase significantly in the coming years for gasum this will
      increase the demand particularly for biogas and liquefied biogas

      changes in natural gas market regulation may result in negative impacts on the competitiveness of gas or our companys
      opportunities to achieve the objectives set for natural gas market development

      the price of natural gas fell from 2015 and reached the lowest point in summer 2016 the natural gas energy charge exclusive
      of tax in june 2016 was at its lowest around 13 below that seen in december 2015 the lower price coupled with the lower
      overall sales volume also affected natural gas revenue which ended up being below the previous years level the average price
      of natural gas in 2016 was around 20 lower than in 2015

      73 carbonneutral future and innovations  development of new business models
      and partnerships




      business development through digitalization


      like many other sectors the energy sector is undergoing a transformation where the efficient utilization of information collected
      is more and more important for service providers to respond to this need in 2016 gasum raised digitalization as one of the
      main themes for the future we are determined to be proactive to develop our sector further our company has accumulated a
      lot of information over the decades  about gas use customers and their energy use  that can be utilized in the provision of
      current as well as new services in the future

      as part of our updated strategy in autumn 2016 we determined our four steps to digitality that we will take to increase our
      digital competences increase the efficiency of our operations and create new opportunities for our customers to increase the
      efficiency of our operations we have already launched projects to create new opportunities through digitalization to make our
      processes more streamlined efficient and automated this can already be seen in the mobilization of our operations in logistics
      optimization and consequently in reductions in emissions from our operations and increases in energy efficiency

      the next step will involve us creating new opportunities for our customers through measures such as gas network and appliance
      usage data analyses big data and smart analytics will improve our services  for current as well as new customers

      digitalization also enables gasum to create new opportunities for customers to switch to lowcarbon energy solutions this way
      we will be able to significantly increase transparency in energy production and related environmental impacts and enable even
      more efficient waste recycling and circular economy in the nordic countries




      energy and nutrient cycling through circular economy

                                                                                                                                              37

gasums corporate responsibility 2016  cleaner tomorrow




      the vital role of the circular economy for efforts to combat climate change and save natural resources has been recognized in
      recent years in addition to environmental values the circular economy is also very important for the promotion of economic
      growth and employment

      in the circular economy materials wastage and waste generation is minimized and wastes and side streams are circulated
      comprehensively back into raw materials through nutrient recycling

      gasums national biogas plant network is a model example of putting the circular economy into practice in waste and nutrient
      recycling as well as the production of renewable energy at our plants the energy content of sewage sludges and other
      biodegradable waste is turned into biogas that can be upgraded into road fuel gas or electricity and heat for the plants own or
      partners use

      in addition to biogas the process yields sanitized fertilizer products that can be utilized directly by farms or refined further for
      industrial use

      biogas production is part of a value chain of various players where not only energy but also recycled nutrients are recovered
      the best benefits of the circular economy can be obtained through cooperation between enterprises where the waste of one
      company is the raw material of the other

      we will develop these solutions further in our production plant network and invest in the further refining of nutrient residues
      generated in biogas production with our partners




      partners important in circular economy promotion
      gasum3



      we promote the circular economy with several partners here are some examples of our partnerships from 2016


      side streams of hämeenlinnan osuusmeijeri cooperative dairy turned into energy

      side streams from the hämeenlinnan osuusmeijeri cooperative dairy production process are taken to gasums riihimäki biogas
      plant where they are produced and upgraded into biogas supplied to hämeenlinna energy company elenia lämpö oy and
      delivered from there back to the cooperative dairy this means energy from the dairy factorys side streams is recovered and
      reused and organic dairy products are made with 100 finnish renewable energy


      cooperation between gasum and soilfood launched

      soilfood and gasum launched their cooperation in the production of recycled fertilizers in conjunction with the oulu and
      riihimäki biogas plants soilfood processes digestates from biogas production into recycled fertilizers for agriculture recycled

                                                                                                                                           38

gasums corporate responsibility 2016  cleaner tomorrow



      fertilizers can be used to replace chemical fertilizers for gasum this cooperation with soilfood is part of a broader partnership
      that began in spring 2016 and a continuation to the circular economy thinking in line with our strategy


      new joint cooperation started between gasum and wärtsilä

      gas supply security at excellent level
      gasum6 gasum7



      spanning more than 40 years our cooperation with the gas supplier enables excellent supply security of natural gas the supply
      security of natural gas has been at an extremely high level throughout these decades of cooperation in addition to the supplier
      key roles are also played by systematic and preventative maintenance work continuous gas network monitoring realtime alerts
      and backup system maintenance digitalization is expected to bring about new opportunities in tasks such as network
      monitoring data collection and analysis as well as maintenance work

      our aim is that there are no unplanned disruptions in gas supply incidents and their risk are analyzed carefully and corrective
      and preventive measures are taken in response supply disruptions are extremely rare in 2016 there were three unplanned
      and five planned supply disruptions the amount of gas not delivered during the year totaled 0606 gwh this corresponds to
      00025 of the total amount of gas delivered

      energy management system development



      the certified iso 50001 energy management system helps improve the energy efficiency of gasums operations products and
      services gasums systematically implemented energy management system received certification in november 2015

      a bachelors thesis was also produced during the spring on energy management system development focusing on the
      development of reporting templates for energy efficiency monitoring and documentation comprehensive interviews with
      gasums energy contact persons helped identify new energy savings potential energy efficiency indicators approaches and
      other development ideas

      we improved energy efficiency and supply security in our operations during 2016 through operational optimization and
      replacement of pressure reduction station boilers and blowdown valves in the spring internal auditors received training in how
      to take the requirements of the energy management system into account in internal audits




      new energy efficiency agreement period



      the energy efficiency agreements are a tool chosen together by the government and industries to fulfil the international
      obligations set for finland without enacting new legislation or taking other coercive measures efficient energy use is one of the
      most important actions against climate change

      gasum had already participated in the voluntary energy efficiency agreement for the period from 2008 until the end of 2016 we
      were among the first companies in september 2016 to also join the new energy efficiency agreement period 20172025 by
      joining the agreement we are a forerunner as a responsible user of energy

      under the agreement gasum made a commitment to the shared indicative energy savings targets under the action plan for the
      energyintensive industry the energy savings target set for the new period is 75 by 2025 with an interim target of 4 by 2020
      calculated on the basis of electricity heat and fuel energy consumption gasums energy savings target as the amount of energy
      is 3200 mwh by 2020 and a total of 6000 mwh by 2025




      energy consumption
      g4en3



      gasums total energy consumption increased in comparison with 2015 our total energy consumption in 2016 was 937 gwh
      electricity consumption has increased because our operations now include new facilities such as filling stations and the riihimäki
      biogas plant the increase in fuel consumption results from the higher usage rate of compressor stations compared with the
      year before our electricity consumption totaled 94 gwh and fuel consumption 147 gwh

      greenhouse gas emission reductions

      promoting the transition to a lowcarbon society

      to reduce the environmental impacts of gasums operations we seek to minimize our greenhouse gas emissions and pay
      particular attention to the share of methane emissions in 2016 the target set by us was still at reducing methane emissions
      from the gas network by 30 from the 2010 level by 2020 the target was already achieved in 2014 and our new corporate
      responsibility objectives were adopted as from the beginning of 2017

      one of our corporate responsibility objectives is to promote the transition to a lowcarbon society reducing methane emissions
      is one of the tools employed to achieve this in gasums operations methane emissions are mainly generated in the
      transmission network and at compressor stations and in minor amounts at biogas upgrading plants the transmission of
      natural gas in the gas network requires pressurization that takes place at natural gaspowered compressor stations located in
      imatra kouvola and mäntsälä

      in 2016 our focus in finland was on reducing fugitive methane emissions from the transmission network the projects were
      prioritized to cover the largest fugitive emission sources and repairs took place on five sites during the year we will continue
      transmission network repair work to reduce fugitive emissions in 2017

                                                                        65

      more efficient ways to map out methane
      emissions

      a major development area for us has been to find even more
      efficient and reliable methods to map our methane
      emissions we have cooperated with the emissions
      measurement technology company aeromon in the
      development of technology relating to methane emission
      mapping

      promising results were obtained from the first test
      measurements carried out during the year technology
      enables the detection and location of very small
      concentrations of methane even from distances up to tens of
      meters the sensor module used in the measurements can
      also be used with unmanned aerial vehicles we will continue
      the application of the method with plantlevel testing to
      evaluate its suitability for use on larger structural entities




      direct greenhouse gas emissions
      g4en15


      in 2016 our methane emissions totaled 374 tonnes the
      amount was smaller than before because the figures no
      longer include methane emissions from the distribution
      business sold by gasum based on data from the fifth
      assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on
      climate change ipcc the global warming potential gwp
      applied to methane is 28

      in addition to methane gasums greenhouse gas emissions
      include carbon dioxide direct greenhouse gas emissions in
      2016 totaled 39326 t co2 e 2015 47229 t co2 e the
      carbon dioxide emissions arose from natural gas use in the
      heat business compressor stations pressure reduction
      stations and properties

      in accordance with the oil and gas sector disclosures the
      greenhouse gas emissions illustrate direct greenhouse gases
      from gasums operations skangass emissions are not
      included the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions was
      mainly due to the reductions in methane emissions biogenic
      carbon dioxide emissions from gasums use of biogas as
      service vehicle and car fuel amounted to 297 t co2 e

                                                                                                                                      66

      indirect greenhouse gas emissions
      g4en16

      gasum switched in part to electricity from renewable energy sources in finnish operations in 2017 our strategy is to promote
      sustainability and this is practical proof our responsible action

      our indirect greenhouse gas emissions from electricity and heat procurement were determined in accordance with the
      greenhouse gas ghg protocol scope 2 guidance on the basis of the locationbased and marketbased methods for the
      locationbased calculations the latest district heat and electricity emission factors published by motiva in finland were
      employed

      greenhouse gas emissions from gasums energy procurement calculated using the locationbased method totaled 6200 tonnes
      in 2016 with greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the groups electricity contract taken into account using the market
      based method the emissions level was 5900 tonnes in 2016




      other significant air emissions
      g4en21



      the combustion of natural gas and biogas does not create
      any particulate or sulfur dioxide emissions the total of
      nitrogen oxide nox emissions in 2016 was 26 tonnes 2015
      22 t

      the biggest nox emissions were generated at compressor
      stations transmission network pressure reduction stations
      and heating plants compressor runtimes in 2016 were
      longer than before increasing the rate of nox emissions

      lowemission units were however favored in compressor
      use choices emission measurements took place at the
      kouvola and mäntsälä compressor stations during 2016 and
      the results are within the limit values for regular use units in
      mäntsälä and for reserve and peak period units in kouvola

                                                                                                                                        67

      waste and water consumption
      g4en23 g4en8


      there was a substantial change in gasums waste volumes in 2016 following the acquisition of seven new biogas plants waste
      volumes of gasums previous operations had been minor only amounting to 100200 tonnes a year at biogas plants packaging
      and plastic waste as well as heavy rejects are generated in the pretreatment of biowaste whereby the volumes of waste are at
      a very different level today

      the volume of waste totaled 5100 in 2016 with biogas plants also included in the figure the volumes of waste generated at
      biogas plants are however low in comparison with the volumes of feedstocks received by the plants we take care of the
      recycling of packaging imported by us through finnish packaging recycling rinki ltd

      gasums water consumption previously comprised water intended for human consumption and process water at properties and
      heat stations current figures also include biogas production plants which increases the water consumption volume gasums
      water consumption in 2016 totaled 165000 m3 at biogas plants water consumption is reduced considerably by the internal
      recycling of reject water in the process which improves the plants heat balance and reduces environmental emissions from
      transport the water consumed by gasum comes from municipal water works

      some biogas plants also use rainwater but the volume is not measured and cannot be estimated reliably

      natural gas is the lowestemission fossil fuel substituting oil or coal with natural gas can help achieve significant emission cuts
      lng is a substitute for more polluting petroleumbased fuels for industries outside the gas pipeline network as well as for
      maritime and road transport

      no fossil carbon dioxide emissions are generated from the use of renewable biogas the combustion of natural gas liquefied
      natural gas and biogas does not create any particulate or sulfur dioxide emissions

      the figure presents the differences between direct carbon dioxide emissions from natural gas and biogas as well as oil and coal




      carbon handprint



      gasum takes part in the carbon handprint project launched in autumn 2016 and coordinated by vtt technical research centre
      of finland

      the project is developing a tool for the measurement of the carbon handprint based on uniform principles and calculation
      guidelines to assess and communicate positive measures and environmental impacts

      the majority of current methods such as lifecycle assessment and the carbon and water footprint indicators based on it
      examine environmental impacts from the negative perspective ie they are based on the measurement of emissions and
      resource consumption

      11 risk management




      comprehensive risk management
      g414


      all decisions objectives and measures involve change and
      all change involves uncertainty this impact caused by the
      uncertainty involved in change on company objectives is
      called risk change in itself  and therefore also risk  is
      however a necessity and key to our companys success

      everyone at gasum makes decisions relating to their work
      every day depending on their role these decisions range
      from technicians following the takeamomenttothink
      checklist before starting a task to strategic policies being
      formulated by our board of directors

      the need to maximize positive and minimize negative
      impacts is the common feature in all these situations to
      achieve this we are continuously developing our operating
      methods and culture in accordance with best practices




      risk management policy


      gasums risk management principles and objectives are determined in our risk management policy the most important of these
      objectives is to safeguard the generation of value in our company over the long term the practical implementation of our
      objectives is determined by general risk management guidelines and specific guidelines on matters such as finances

      this provides us with our risk management framework risk management processes risktaking guidelines responsibilities and
      application the framework allows gasum to identify and assess risks and plan risk management measures




      risk assessment and reporting model renewed in 2016


      risks as well as any opportunities brought by them are assessed by gasum regularly at least once a year and whenever
      necessary as changes take place in our circumstances the assessments cover maximum loss probabilities and on the basis of
      these the expected risk value

      for each risk the potential reputation risk is also assessed risks related to corporate responsibility are also part of the annual
      assessment in 2016 we created new risk assessment and management models in accordance with the iso 31000 standard our
      risk management policy was also updated and our business risks surveyed the new approaches are due for introduction during
      2017




      business risks

      gasums most significant risks are to do with fuel sourcing new business operations and business regulation


      fuel sourcing

                                                                                                                                             74

      the price of natural gas under gasums supply contract is indexlinked following updates to the supply contract in may 2016 the
      crude oil brent price d35 subindex of the basic price index for domestic supply and the api2 price reference for coal were
      taken into use as new price indices the indices are calculated every month applying sixmonth averages the indices applied in
      procurement are also applied to the sales prices of natural gas which creates a natural hedge for the prices

      lng sourcing and sales involve considerable temporal currency and hedging risks coupled with various other financial risks
      these create a material risk concentration for the gasum group gasums business is also capital intensive and the group faces
      a regular need for financing

      all these risks relating to financing are administered by the groups finance unit together with the business functions within the
      scope provided by our treasury policy and risk policy for commodities


      new business operations

      there are also considerable risks and opportunities involved in the new business activities developed by gasum in particular
      these include the lng and biogas business and the development of the transport use of gas the energy sector is characterized
      by large initial investments the profitability of which is difficult to predict specifically before the operations are launched and
      have become established


      business regulation

      natural gas transmission activities and energy trade are both supervised by the energy authority changes in finnish or
      european regulation may result in adverse or positive effects on the companys financial position or opportunities to pursue
      objectives set for the development of the natural gas market in finnish regulation the regulation of gas network operations was
      reformed during 2015 for the next eight years 20162023 gasum participated in regulation formulation through active dialog
      and statements

      we are prepared for natural gas supply disruptions through reserve fuel arrangements the functioning of the transmission
      system is monitored and improved through network repairs and renewal in accordance with a longterm plan new network
      sections are constructed in response to customer demand

                                                                                                                                          75

      internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the corporate responsibility
      information that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error

      procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained our assurance report has been prepared in accordance
      with the terms of our engagement we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone else except to gasum ltd for our work

      engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement an assurance engagement
      involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and other disclosures in the corporate responsibility
      information the procedures selected depend on the practitioners judgement including an assessment of the risks of material
      misstatement of the corporate responsibility information

      our work consisted of amongst others the following procedures

                                  interviewing senior management of the company
                                  visiting the companys head office as well as one site in finland
                                  interviewing employees responsible for collecting and reporting the corporate responsibility
                                  information at the group level and at the site level where our site visit was conducted
                                  assessing how group employees apply the companys reporting instructions and procedures
                                  testing the accuracy and completeness of the information from original documents and systems on
                                  a sample basis
                                  testing the consolidation of information and performing recalculations on a sample basis



      limited assurance conclusion

      based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained nothing has come to our attention that causes
      us to believe that gasum ltds corporate responsibility information for the reporting period ended 31 december 2016 is not
      properly prepared in all material respects in accordance with the reporting criteria

      when reading our assurance report the inherent limitations to the accuracy and completeness of corporate responsibility
      information should be taken into consideration
