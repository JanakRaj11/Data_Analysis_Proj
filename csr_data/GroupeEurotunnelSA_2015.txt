4 risk factors

     in conducting its business the eurotunnel group is exposed to different risks of an industrial environmental human commercial
     financial or other nature

     the eurotunnel group applies the provisions of the reference framework published by the french financial markets authority amf for
     internal control and risk management systems eurotunnel group has an active risk management policy designed to protect and
     develop its assets and reputation and to safeguard the interests of shareholders employees customers suppliers its other
     stakeholders and the environment the group has a comprehensive system in place to identify and manage risks which is described in
     chapter 16 of this registration document

     for the 2014 financial year the eurotunnel group has carried out the annual review of risks that could have a significant negative impact
     on its operations reputation financial position or results this risk review encompassed all the consolidated subsidiaries of the group
     concerning the myferrylink maritime business the groups risks are those inherent to the shipping operations and the commercial
     activity for the record the ferries are operated exclusively by a worker cooperative which is external to the group the risk management
     mechanisms now apply across the entire scope of consolidation




     41 risks related to the environment in which the
     eurotunnel group operates

     411 risks related to the economic and political climate

     the groups operations are directly influenced by the prevailing economic conditions in its main markets particularly france and the
     united kingdom changes in crosschannel traffic and rail freight traffic are linked to the general economic context while the groups
     business has demonstrated its resilience during periods of economic and financial crisis and although the british economy did
     demonstrate growth in 2014 a deterioration or stagnation of economic conditions could have a direct impact on the volume of rail and
     maritime traffic in both the passenger and freight segments uncertainties about the general economic situation have had and are likely
     to continue to have a negative impact on the business performance and financial position of many companies and this could have
     repercussions for the groups customers and suppliers

     various events could change the economic environment in which the group operates and could as a corollary affect its business in
     particular a political decision taken by either one of the two nations to withdraw from the european union could also if acted upon
     impact on the economy and on trade between great britain and continental europe and could thus have an effect on the groups traffic
     volumes

     all these risks are measured and monitored at meetings of the corporate management committees to anticipate and prepare for
     changes in the economic environment and to make any necessary strategic and tactical adjustments


     412 risks related to the competitive environment

     in its different activities the group faces strong competition from both international and national players in the private and public sectors
     this competitive environment presented in chapter 6 of this registration document could intensify across all of the groups areas of
     activity particularly during a slump in the truck market and increased price sensitivity among customers at a time of economic instability

     with regard to the activities of the fixed link the eurotunnel group faces competition from crosschannel transport operators whose
     pricing strategies and other competitive initiatives could have a negative impact on shuttle service volumes particularly truck shuttle
     services and passenger numbers on highspeed passenger trains as indicated in chapter 6 of this registration document the
     groups commercial and operational strategy could be affected by this context in which service quality remains a crucial distinguishing
     factor the group adapts its marketing strategy to this competitive environment particularly during its operational reviews

     concerning the competitive environment of europorte developments in the market and in rail freight transport traffic and related
     activities are due to recent changes quite specific as a result of a complex amalgamation of economic logistical and industrial factors
     among them the reliability of the transport service the quality and condition of train paths and the balanced prioritisation of freight and
     passenger transport french rail freight traffic has undergone a significant downturn since 2000 with freight volume virtually halved

reaching its alltime low in 2010 followed by a somewhat modest recovery in 20111 in 2014 competition between the operators
remained strong and the longstanding operator continues to enjoy a prominent position in the market in the space of 10 years the
french market has opened up as much as the german market has in 20 years of liberalisation the situation is different in great britain
where rail freight is developing and where it is anticipated that it will take an even greater share of the british freight transport market

myferrylink faces strong competition from other operators in the short straits market the pricing strategies and other competitive
initiatives of those direct competitors are likely to have an even greater impact given that there is less differentiation between the services
offered compared with the fixed link service

in response to this intensification of the competition the group rationalises its operations and processes in order to adapt its cost
structure offer new services to its customers and enhance its commercial offering

as part of the groups treasury procedures described in section 169 of this registration document its finance department continually
monitors movements in inflation and interest rates and its treasury risk management committee receives monthly reports containing
forecast and actual rate changes


interest rate
as explained in note w of the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document the risk of adverse
movements in interest rates during the life of the term loan is covered by the fact that i two tranches of the loan are at a fixed rate ii the
two inflationlinked tranches are at a fixed rate and iii the last two tranches are at a floating rate and are covered by a swap converting
the floating rate into a fixed rate for the full life of the term loan

rate of inflation
as explained in note w of the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document the inflation risk
affects both interest and principal repayments on the two inflationlinked tranches of 750 million and c367 million respectively by way
of illustration a percentage point variation in the inflation rate would have an annual impact of c16 million on the amount of the principal
of tranches a1 and a2 and the associated financial charges


foreign exchange risks
around half of the eurotunnel groups revenue is generated in sterling while a larger proportion of expenditure operating expense and
investment is in euros moreover the groups term loan is denominated in sterling for a notional amount of 1467 billion at
31 december 2014 and in euros for a total notional amount of c1926 billion at 31 december 2014 the eurotunnel group makes every
effort to match more closely the currencies in which its revenues and expenses are denominated and also uses currency hedging to
manage its foreign exchange risk effectively however there is no guarantee that these measures will significantly reduce the risk borne
by the eurotunnel group in the event of a fall in sterling against the euro or ensure that the materialisation of this risk would not have a
significant impact on the eurotunnel groups financial position andor ability to service its debt

     the eurotunnel group prepares its consolidated financial statements in euros at 31 december 2014 its balance sheet exposure to
     trading currencies was as follows

     the assets and liabilities in the above table do not include fixed assets or equity which are carried at historical exchange rates

     fluctuations in the sterlingeuro exchange rate have an impact on the value in euros of revenue costs expenses and financial income

     in addition to the measures described above the groups finance department continually monitors movements in the sterlingeuro
     exchange rate while its treasury risk management committee receives monthly reports containing forecast and actual exchange rate
     fluctuations a report on the work of the treasury risk management committee is submitted to get ses audit committee

     the groups various business activities result in receivables and debt distributed among the different group companies sometimes in
     different currencies particularly for get se and its subsidiaries the group arranges funding for its various business activities but these
     intragroup financing arrangements may generate currency imbalances which as a result of exchange rate risk and depending on the
     direction of the funding flows may automatically translate into losses in the consolidated financial statements


     credit and counterparty risks
     customer credit risk
     the groups exposure to customer credit risk is limited to its customers in the united kingdom and eurozone countries with the
     exception of
      the railways public institutions which accounted for 25 of the groups revenue in 2014
      the groups passenger shuttle and myferrylink customers who pay for their tickets in advance particularly via the internet
        consequently the credit risk in relation to these customers is very limited

     the groups maximum exposure to credit risk on trade receivables as well as the ageing of those trade receivables and the provision for
     bad debts is explained in detail in note p of the appendix to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this
     registration document

     credit risk is limited in view of the distribution of the portfolio and customer volumes in fact revenue from the groups five largest
     customers not including the railways only accounted for 6 of its total revenue in 2014

     the group manages its customer credit risk through a policy requiring that every new customer undergo a credit check before being
     able to benefit from the groups standard credit terms the groups credit risk exposure to account customers is managed by means of
     continuous monitoring of their financial situation and of their outstanding debt in relation to the credit limits and payment terms granted
     to them


     suppliers
     the groups exposure to counterparty risk with its suppliers is managed by framework agreements that contain standard mechanisms
     based on thirdparty guarantees or prepayments and appropriate recovery procedures


     shortterm investments
     the groups maximum exposure to credit risk on shortterm investments is set out in note w to the consolidated financial statements in
     paragraph 2031 of this registration document




8   2014 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se

                                                                                                                   risk factors                  
                                                                                                                                                 4

the group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in i term deposits and certificates of deposit with a maximum maturity of six
months and with counterparties with at least a p1 shortterm rating from moodys and ii funds and money market funds with a
longterm rating of at least aaa from moodys or aaa from sp

the amounts invested by the group in any one fund or money market fund should not exceed c120 million per fund or money market
fund in euros or 100 million per fund or money market fund in sterling investments in term deposits or certificates of deposit with the
same counterparty may not exceed c78 million or 65 million

the treasury risk management committee monitors the groups compliance with this investment policy


liquidity risk
a significant proportion of the eurotunnel groups operational cash flow is taken up by interest payments on the term loan and since
2013 ongoing repayment of the principal in instalments until 2050 this expense could reduce the groups capacity to finance its
investments or possible external growth operations

a breakdown of the groups financial liabilities by contractual maturity is given in note w of the appendix to the consolidated financial
statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document

the terms and conditions of the groups bank loans particularly concerning defaults and early repayment as well as the financial
covenants that the group must comply with in respect of debt servicing are described in chapter 22 of this registration document and
note u of the appendix to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document

the contractual terms of the groups hedging instruments swaps to cover its variablerate loans are explained in note u of the appendix
to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document

the group manages its liquidity risk exposure through centralised treasury management by its finance department which continually
monitors the groups treasury position the group also prepares monthly short and mediumterm cash flow forecasts which are
presented to the treasury risk management committee composed of the head of financial control the deputy chief executive officer
and their main managers

in this context the group acquired floating rate notes with a nominal value of c167 million in 2011 and 2012 these notes were issued by
channel link enterprises finance clef the securitisation vehicle for the groups debt these notes have the same characteristics as
the groups tranche c debt namely a maturity between 2041 and 2050 see note p of the appendix to the consolidated financial
statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document this acquisition will in particular improve the groups financial results

as indicated in note w of the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document the company has
carried out a specific review of its liquidity risk and considers that it is able to meet its future obligations

as indicated in section 106 of this registration document at 31 december 2014 the group was in compliance with all its debt service
cover ratios financial covenants

as indicated in section 101 of this registration document get se received a baa2 rating from moodys in 2007 which is still valid at
the date of this registration document

raw materials and energy risks
for the fixed link the eurotunnel group uses electricity as its main source of energy particularly for train traction the supply of
electricity represents a significant expense for the eurotunnel group accounting for about 5 of overall operating expenditure in 2014
and a large general increase in the cost of raw materials and electricity could have negative repercussions on the groups results

in the light of the highly volatile energy market the group has introduced a risk management policy to hedge market price risk and
volume risk

application of the french law on the new organisation of electricity markets nome helps reduce the groups exposure to energy
market volatility

volume purchases on the uk wholesale market are performed under annual contracts purchases are made in tranches to spread the
risk based on fundamental and technical market analysis

to mitigate volume risk the group closely monitors its electricity use and regularly updates its forecasts




                                                                               2014 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se
                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                 9


4 risk factors

     the group and its electricity suppliers negotiate the volume constraints in power supply contracts so as to reduce the groups volume
     risk by including the option of changing contractual volumes without penalty or by adding a takeorpay clause based on an annual
     rather than seasonal timeframe

     the europorte entities favour the use of electrical power when these subsidiaries use diesel locomotives the cost price of traction may
     be affected by a change in the fuel price ways of mitigating this risk are being explored

     the maritime segment is exposed to risks related to the entry into force of the marpol marine pollution regulations mentioned in
     section 415 of this registration document and their impact on the volatility of light fuel oil prices which could have repercussions on
     the group as a result of higher prices charged by seafrance scop on capacity buyback deals


     risk on shares and other financial instruments
     the groups investments are governed by its treasury policy and are therefore limited to the list of financial instruments detailed in
     shortterm investments above and the floating rate notes mentioned in liquidity risk above the group does not invest in equities
     interest rate instruments or other derivatives


     414 risks related to retirement benefits

     in the united kingdom the eurotunnel group administers three defined benefit pension schemes
      the main pension scheme the channel tunnel group pension fund which changed in 2010 from a wholly defined benefit plan to a
         hybrid scheme part defined benefit and part defined contribution
      a pension fund for gbrf and
      a defined benefit plan closed to new entrants senior executive pension fund open only to senior managers who joined prior
         to 2000

     an independent actuary values the schemes assets and liabilities the present value of the schemes assets which are not due to be
     realised in the short term may undergo significant changes related to market developments

     were the values of the schemes assets and liabilities to reveal underfunding the eurotunnel group could be asked to fund the shortfall
     within the framework of a plan extending over a period of up to 10 years

     risks associated with the uk pension schemes are managed through a regular review process and meetings with the trustees
     actuaries and other professional advisers


     415 risks related to the regulatory and political environment

     regulatory environment
     the eurotunnel group operates in a highly regulated environment which results in a high degree of dependency on decisions and
     measures over which the group has very little or no influence these regulations are subject to change and interpretation by
     administrative authorities and courts and could be considerably tightened by national or european authorities which would adversely
     affect the groups business activities and financial results compliance with the rules in their current form and as amended in the future
     could result in increased operating and investment costs the competent authorities could also adopt other stricter rules or rules in new
     areas that are not currently considered with similar effect


     fixed link
     this regulatory framework includes the european rail directives particularly directive 200114ec which concerns both the division of
     rail infrastructure capacity and the pricing of rail infrastructure and specifies certain operating rules applicable to rail infrastructure
     managers this regulatory framework is constantly changing the provisions of the recast directive on the first railway package
     201234ue need to be transposed by the channel tunnel authorities with an economic regulation enacted henceforth by two
     separate national authorities lautorite de regulation des activites ferroviaires on the french side and the office of rail regulation on the
     british side which could potentially lead to dissonance the interpretation of the directive by these two separate national authorities may
     have an impact on the pricing of rail infrastructure and consequently on fixed link revenues the draft fourth railway package could
     affect the operation and financial position of concessionaires as a result of the proposed separation of the activities of infrastructure
     manager and rail company these measures could impose restrictions on the eurotunnel groups business activities and affect its
     revenue these directives can also be subject to change and interpretation by administrative authorities and courts and the associated
     regulations could even be significantly tightened by national or european authorities

operation of the tunnel is subject to highly detailed regulations drawn up by the igc and the safety authority the concession
agreement described in section 22 of this registration document may be terminated by the states in the event of force majeure
particularly in the event of war or a serious breach by the concessionaires of their obligations under the concession agreement
furthermore if the eurotunnel group should be in breach of its obligations under the concession agreement the igc could impose
significant daily penalties the igc has the power to make decisions particularly in relation to the distance between trains using the
tunnel that could lead to a reduction in tunnel capacity the regulatory authorities could also adopt new measures relating to safety or
other matters particularly concerning infrastructure access conditions or more specifically the development of more rigorous border
controls in accordance with the uk governments immigration act 2014 the eurotunnel group must control passports of passengers
who leave the united kingdom via its folkestone terminal with effect from 8 april 2015 the eurotunnel group is working with the
uk government to minimise the impact of these new controls on the traffic flows on the folkestone terminal this could force the
eurotunnel group to incur significant additional expenditure or could impose restrictions on its business activities and impact
its revenue

the public affairs department is responsible for ensuring compliance with the rights and obligations arising from the concession by
both the states and the concessionaires and for monitoring relations with the igc the eurotunnel group has no control over the igc
which represents the two governments particularly the french ministere des transports and the british department of transport
moreover the eurotunnel group has no control over the french regulatory authority for rail business or over the corresponding british
regulatory authority which are responsible for economic regulation of the fixed link that being the case the obligations assumed
under the concession agreement require the states to conduct themselves in a specific manner in the performance of their duties the
concession agreement grants the concessionaires the option of requesting before the arbitration tribunal in accordance with the
terms of the treaty of canterbury compensation for breaches of contract by the states


europorte
in france the costs of access to the national rail network are high their increase andor a reduction of government funding could
contribute to a worsening of europortes financial results a termination of funding would give rise to a marked increase in the operating
costs of rail operators including epf which would be likely to significantly disrupt the market and the pricing policy and to threaten the
competitiveness of rail freight in the long term in the area of transport the public authorities are recommending the promotion and
development of alternative modes of transport encouraging a modal shift from road to rail is one of the main levers of this policy yet
frances secondary rail network which was historically very dense has been neglected and following a lack of maintenance and use is
gradually being dismantled however this network is essential to the survival of rail freight since it allows a large part of freight flows to be
channelled into the main network without political will on the part of the actors responsible for developing transport infrastructure and
the implications of that lack of political will for the modal shift strategy the progressive deterioration or eventual disappearance of the
feeder networks could have a major impact on the revenue of epf which obtains a third of its business from the transportation of grain
the railway reform act of 4 august 2014 may compromise the independence of management of the french rail network and the
impartiality of train paths

in great britain policies concerning financial assistance and subsidies have an impact on traffic particularly in the fields of biomass and
intermodal transport

europorte france europorte channel and gbrf operate under rail freight operators licences these activities may only commence on
the infrastructure after approval of the safety documentation and issuance of a safety certificate by the competent authority
furthermore in order to obtain authorisation to transport certain hazardous materials on a given infrastructure a safety plan is submitted
and validated by the manager of the infrastructure in question

the plan to harmonise the conditions of employment of railway workers both freight and passenger is one of the objectives of the draft
railway reform it is anticipated that a foundation decree will set the common rules regarding organisation and working time
guaranteeing the requirements of safety and continuity of public services and that the decree will be supplemented by a sectorwide
collective agreement the drafting of which has been entrusted to a joint committee composed of the french public and rail transport
union and seven trade union organisations the establishment of a harmonised social framework for the whole rail sector could affect
the social equilibrium of the company and adversely affect the competitiveness of europorte


myferrylink
concerning the maritime sector to be compliant with marpol regulation 7378 regulations for the prevention of air pollution by
ships to be enacted in 2015 the eurotunnel group as a ship owner has chosen to use light fuel oil so that its ships will have
international air pollution prevention certification in compliance with the marpol regulations this decision exposes the company to
the risk of price volatility affecting this type of fuel which may be in greater demand




                                                                                  2014 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se
                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      11


4 risk factors

     businesses within the group are subject to different laws and regulations an amendment or tightening of those regulations could result
     in additional investment or operating costs for the group in order to bring itself into line with those regulatory developments changes in
     regulations or case law concerning the application of tax rules could also have an impact on the groups results moreover other
     measures not directly related to the regulation of the eurotunnel groups business activities could still affect them by way of example
     increased measures to enforce regulations relating to immigration customs and excise duties could cause delays or affect customer
     satisfaction levels


     416 risks related to extreme weather events

     the shuttle service unlike the ferries is unaffected by sea conditions and is not dependent on the weather however the occurrence of
     events related to extreme weather conditions such as major storms or heavy snowfall can make road networks impassable thus
     preventing customers from accessing the fixed link such events could also disrupt the functioning of the fixed link infrastructure
     reducing its operating capacity or even leading to its temporary closure extreme weather events can also have an impact on the rail
     companies using the fixed link and on essential service providers or supply networks that are indispensable for the operation of the
     fixed link electricity water roads fuel etc finally they can also affect rail freight transport activities or the financial situation of their
     customers and could prevent the myferrylink ships from making sea crossings

     thus extreme weather events can affect the groups business and impact its revenue

     for the concession the eurotunnel group has onsite weather stations to forecast these events moreover operational continuity plans
     ensure the continuity of operations in degraded mode for a given period in such cases the group also has management plans for road
     traffic in the vicinity of the terminals


     417 risks linked to terrorist threats and attacks

     like other infrastructure operators the eurotunnel group constantly faces the risk of a terrorist threat or attack on its installations
     particularly the fixed link or on neighbouring infrastructure required for circulation of the trains or shuttles this risk is all the greater in
     view of the general security threat now faced as a result of attempted terrorist attacks the eurotunnel group carries out certain activities
     on behalf of the states and consequently must implement security and public health measures along with specific measures for the
     application of national programmes such as the vigipirate security alert system in accordance with the concession agreement the
     eurotunnel group adapts its operational practices to meet these requirements and to deliver the required quality of service it is not
     possible to rule out a change in these requirements that would make it necessary for the group to adapt its business and commercial
     practices leading to an increase in operating costs or deterioration in service quality that could have an adverse effect on the groups
     image competitive advantages activity financial position and results irrespective of the insurance cover in place see section 43
     below and government responsibilities if this risk were to materialise it could have a significant adverse impact on the business
     revenue and image of the eurotunnel group in addition safety and security measures could be tightened which could increase
     inconvenience caused to passengers reduce capacity and substantially increase the groups safety and securityrelated expenditure
     risk management procedures related to the risk of terrorism are described in section 1724 of this registration document


     418 risks related to health epidemics

     in the european and global health context the outbreak of an epidemic or the fear of an epidemic are likely to have a negative impact on
     traffic leading to a fall in revenue andor an increase in costs linked to public health measures

     for the implementation of its operational continuity plans particularly with regard to operation of the concession the eurotunnel group
     has a crisis management unit which decides on any operational adjustments that may be required working closely and continuously
     with the competent authorities


     419 risk of harm to image andor reputation

     the group may be exposed to reputational risks particularly when the groups values or operational excellence are questioned or when
     its legitimacy as an infrastructure manager or transport operator is challenged

through its organisation and procedures the eurotunnel group makes every effort to prevent the occurrence of operational risks and
disparaging attacks that could harm its image andor reputation

furthermore in relation to its development the group could face opposition from local communities or organisations to the installation
or operation of certain types of equipment or the setting up of new activities deterioration in these conditions could result in permits and
licences being refused or delayed and have a negative impact on the groups business therefore the eurotunnel group engages in
broad consultation upstream of its projects builds partnerships with civil society and ensures that its activities generate economic
benefits consistent with the expectations of the communities




42 risks related to conducting the business of the
eurotunnel group

421 risks related to external growth development and investment
in the groups business

as part of its development strategy the eurotunnel group has pursued in the past and may pursue in the future external growth
through acquisitions such transactions involve a certain number of risks related to their implementation the integration of the newly
acquired activities and personnel failure to generate expected synergies maintaining uniform controls procedures and policies the
appearance of unexpected costs or liabilities and applicable regulations these risks could have a significant negative effect on the
groups business financial position or results or on its ability to achieve its objectives

in order to maintain its quality of service the eurotunnel group is planning largescale maintenance and replacement of part of its rolling
stock three new truck shuttles have already been ordered in january 2015 given the time required to maintain build and commission
these complex elements the capital expenditure must be planned several years in advance the length of the investment cycle carries
risks for the expected return on past investments the uncertainties linked to this type of longterm investment could cause significant
budget overruns

at the end of 2014 the group announced its decision to seek a buyer for myferrylink and its three ferries divestiture transactions may
not be completed in the anticipated timeframe they may not achieve the desired disposal value they may result in additional costs or
they may be unsuccessful


422 operational risks

operational risks inherent in rail transport and infrastructure operation
 the eurotunnel group has more than 20 years of experience in maintaining its rolling stock equipment and infrastructure it has a
  standard maintenance programme a longterm largescale maintenance programme as well as a rolling stock and equipment
  replacement plan as indicated in section 624 of this registration document however given the specific nature of the rolling stock
  equipment and infrastructure used for the fixed link the particular conditions and intensity of their use and technological advances
  these programmes and plans may prove insufficient or unsuitable particularly in the event of premature obsolescence or an increase
  in technical faults this would lead to unforeseen costs or partial or temporary service interruptions which could affect eurotunnel
  groups business financial position and results the eurotunnel group has implemented standardisation and reconditioning
  programmes designed to reduce future maintenance needs and improve the availability of its rolling stock the impact of the new
  industrial solutions introduced to improve operating performance may be hard to master or grasp and could lead to temporary
  disruptions to services
 during the repair or maintenance of its systems technical incidentsaccidents may jeopardise the safety of eurotunnel group
  employees and subcontractors the eurotunnel group is committed to implementing all safety plans necessary to ensure the
  wellbeing of all persons working on its sites

                                                                                                                                                13


4 risk factors

        risks related to safety and fire in the tunnel are covered by the design of the system itself and by a series of principles procedures
         and controls that have been validated by the igc with regard to past incidents the occurrence of another major fire would result in a
         substantial increase in the insurance premium the introduction and effective operation of the safe stations reduces the impact of
         this historical risk but cannot reduce the possibility of recurrence the group regularly monitors innovations in fire detection and
         prevention systems the group also takes into account the fact that these risks could come from external entities using the groups
         facilities and therefore as part of its policy to improve safety and service quality it has two additional independent rescue
         locomotives
        concerning risks related to security the eurotunnel group continues to implement intrusion prevention measures and continues to
         encourage the detection of concealed passengers on trucks transported the flow of illegal migrants increased sharply in 2014 a
         continuing trend of increasing numbers of illegal migrants could require the investment of additional resources or result in poorer
         service quality which would consequently have an impact on the results of this activity
        the current state of the rolling stock market requires europorte in france to place orders to buy andor lease long before they are
         produced and brought into service creating the risk that the market offering may be inappropriate to europortes needs when the
         time comes this could affect europortes ability to fulfil its commitments in a timely manner on the british side rolling stock that
         meets european and national regulations seems to be increasingly difficult to obtain and this could hold back gbrfs development


     lack of control by the group over the activities of the railways and railway companies
     network business being the groups principal customer could have a significant impact on the groups financial situation the tunnel is
     used by high speed passenger train operators and train operators rail freight services whose results could be affected by external
     events and circumstances beyond the control of the eurotunnel group the eurotunnel group does not operate these services and
     cannot exert direct influence on the commercial operation of high speed passenger train services or the train operators rail freight
     services the performance service level capacities and prices offered by these operators to their customers along with other factors
     that may be beyond the operators control influence the use of their services in turn these factors affect the revenue that the eurotunnel
     group receives from the railways and railway companies the train operators rail freight services face organisational problems
     relating to coordination of national operators regulatory or labour constraints specific to the rail sector technical constraints of the rail
     network lines used and the priority of freight versus passenger traffic on infrastructures within the european union these barriers to
     development could make it hard to achieve significant growth in the volumes transported by the train operators rail freight services
     and could even lead to a substantial decline in traffic a significant portion of the eurotunnel groups revenue therefore depends on the
     successful operation of these services by entities over which it has no control

     the railway facilities used by the high speed passenger train services and rail freight trains are outside the eurotunnel groups
     concession and could be subject to disruption from various sources this could result in the stoppage or reduction of this traffic such
     events could have a negative impact on the groups revenue derived from the usage of its railway network


     423 risks related to human resources

     skills
     the groups business encompasses a wide range of occupations calling on a variety of skills in the context of an inverted age pyramid
     for the fixed link the replacement of some staff and potential retraining plans are areas managed by the groups human resources
     department the eurotunnel group has therefore increased its forward planning in terms of skills management and the transfer
     of knowhow

     calling for a broad spectrum of requirements particularly in terms of safety technical expertise and psychological aptitude occupations
     in the rail industry require lengthy training staff shortages and the difficulty of replacement within existing teams including the
     management team connected with stiff competition among the various operators could affect certain developments in order to
     anticipate the risk of the loss of key skills or the growing scarcity of workers for certain jobs the group is pursuing a human resources
     policy that is highly oriented towards forwardlooking job management adapted to different contexts and on the encouragement of
     employability through the development of training as indicated in chapter 17 below faced with the absence of government training
     programmes leading to qualifications in the rail sector the group has set up an organisation dedicated to rail industry training courses in
     addition in order to retain its key employees and motivate their performance the group has introduced longterm incentives and a
     bonus share scheme for all group employees

     labour relations
     in the current economic downturn the risk of deteriorating labour relations and staff disputes cannot be ruled out strikes walkouts
     industrial action or other forms of unrest could disrupt the activities of the eurotunnel group such events could occur not only within the
     eurotunnel group but could also affect its customers subcontractors or suppliers developments within the group could mean that
     consultation and negotiation no longer effectively regulate relations between management and staff in the event of a breakdown in the

negotiation process those relations could deteriorate leading to loss of motivation and trust among employees and affecting the
groups external and internal image

the group has already implemented restructuring and reorganisation in the past further measures cannot be completely ruled out in
the future reorganisation could affect the groups relations with its employees giving rise to labour disputes and specifically stoppages
strikes and other forms of disruption that could have a negative effect on the groups business and results

labourrelated risk management procedures are described in section 172 of this registration document

quality of working life
one of the groups ambitions is to create the right conditions for employee engagement motivation and to prevent workrelated stress
to help its managers cope with the growing complexity of their work the group has invested in the promotion of managerial practices
that place an emphasis on staff development the group has implemented initiatives in the most appropriate areas of the organisation
listening to employees telephone helpline psychological support unit etc strategic workforce planning career ladder information
development of skills optimisation of internal mobility and the annual deployment of a personnel management cycle whose main
objective is to identify recognise and promote the groups best talent and also to spot potential talent that could develop towards
certain roles of responsibility or prominent positions within the organisation details of the groups strategy and its results are regularly
shared through internal communication which fosters cohesion


424 risks related to defaulting suppliers or subcontractors

the eurotunnel group relies on subcontractors for parts of its business particularly relating to security cleaning primarily industrial and
vehicle chocking it is possible that some of these subcontractors might fail to fulfil their obligations which could affect the eurotunnel
groups results or financial position subcontractor default risk is managed through the purchasing departments careful supplier
selection procedure as well as through the monitoring of suppliers financial positions and close contract management

the rolling stock and some of the fixed link installations have been supplied in very small volumes by a very limited number of suppliers
to meet highly specific operating requirements the eurotunnel group believes that if its original suppliers were unable to supply
replacement parts or whole shuttles for any reason or were unwilling to do so on acceptable terms it would be able to obtain the
necessary equipment from other manufacturers however the price or timeframe for such replacements could have an adverse impact
on the eurotunnel groups financial position and prospects for europorte the need to lease new locomotives in coming years brings an
increased risk of reliance on key suppliers equipment and materials risk is managed through the purchase of reserve stocks the
dynamic annual or sixmonthly review of suppliers and research into alternative materials and technologies

the allocation by the sncf network of poor quality train paths or the unavailability of train paths could harm europortes image and
affect its business on 22 january 2013 europorte signed a framework agreement with reseau ferre de france on the infrastructure
capacity required for the rail company to operate in addition to a new agreement on train path quality for the service timetable covered
by the deal the sncf network agreed to confirm or withdraw freight paths at least two months before the service is scheduled to run

the ferries owned by the group are operated exclusively by a worker cooperative which is external to the group and could default


425 environmental risks

the concessionaires are subject to french english and european environmental regulations as well as local regulations that require
them to either obtain authorisation for the disposal of certain waste materials or contract an accredited company to remove and dispose
of the waste any breach of the environmental regulations would result in them being fined for causing pollution the regulations also
stipulate that the authorities may force the closure of any facility that does not comply with decisions requiring certain environmentally
harmful activities to cease or be modified

the eurotunnel group has an environmental protection and sustainable development policy which is described in chapter 17 of this
registration document however there is no guarantee that united kingdom french european national or local authorities will not
impose new regulations leading to additional expenditure which could have an adverse impact on the results or financial position of the
eurotunnel group due to the nature of its activities and its potential new projects or developments the eurotunnel group while being
attentive to compliance with the applicable environmental regulations could experience delays in these developments because of
possible constraints or claims




                                                                               2014 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se
                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                  15


4 risk factors

     these risks are managed through an environmental analysis which identifies the various risks and assesses their potential impact the
     resources required to minimise this impact can then be identified the regulations outline the risks associated with some activities carried
     out at the terminals and specify requirements for reducing and monitoring their impact

     in the united kingdom the concessionaires as managers of an infrastructure of major importance to the british economy were
     required by the department for environment food and rural affairs defra under the 2008 climate change act to carry out a study
     of the ability of its infrastructure to withstand the foreseeable effects of climate change


     426 social acceptability

     the industrial sites and areas in which europorte operates and the products transported present a risk in terms of the environment and
     industrial safety
     the main customers of socorail the europorte subsidiary specialising in the provision of industrial logistical services include actors from
     the chemical and oil industries subject to the seveso classification these industries are subject to very strict safety regulations
     therefore extremely stringent safety criteria are imposed on subcontractors although socorail has for several years been engaged in a
     voluntary process of iso 9001 2008 quality certification and mase business safety improvement manual safety certification the
     danger toxicity or flammability of some raw materials could cause risks particularly risks of accidents fires explosions and damage to
     the environment and wildlife and could harm the environmental image of europorte and the group the same applies when europortes
     rail freight subsidiaries transport various hazardous toxic or flammable products furthermore the business of rail freight haulage may
     present environmental risks in the event of a rail accident due to the materials transported or the zones crossed the industrial safety
     and environmental risk prevention policy is described in section 1742 of this registration document


     427 legal risks

     risks related to specific terms of the concession agreement
     the concession agreement under which the eurotunnel group operates may only be modified through amendments negotiated with
     the states these negotiations could be long and complex were economic financial or technical developments affecting the eurotunnel
     group to make rapid changes necessary the specific terms of the concession agreement could limit the eurotunnel groups ability to
     adapt or to adjust its business to those developments which could affect its results and financial position

     risks related to competition regulation
     the eurotunnel groups market pricing practices and behaviour are governed by competition law the application of which is supervised
     by the french and british competition authorities and the european commission this could give rise to the introduction of new
     regulatory measures concerning prices penalties thirdparty proceedings for damages and restrictions on the groups business
     activities these or other measures could have a significant negative impact on the eurotunnel groups financial position particularly in
     the case of divergent interpretations of a given operation by the french authority and the british authority as indicated in section 208 of
     this registration document the french competition authorities did not come to the same conclusion as the british competition
     authorities concerning the purchase of certain exseafrance assets the groups management of legal risks is carefully monitored by
     several departments and in particular by the groups legal department through a monitoring procedure and meetings with the relevant
     operational departments

     risks related to failure to meet contractual obligations
     like any business the eurotunnel group is by definition exposed to risks related to failure to meet its contractual obligations to its
     customers suppliers employees and financial partners


     customers
     the concessionaires obligations to the railways under the railway usage contract which ends in 2052 or to railway companies
     under the network statement and the consequences of failing to meet those obligations are detailed in chapter 22 of this registration
     document the group did not see any significant reduction in the railways contributions to its fixed annual charges in 2014 as a result
     of unavailability of the fixed link it cannot be ruled out that the railways may wish before the end of the railway usage contract to
     renegotiate it or dispute certain of its provisions

     as part of its transport activity the eurotunnel group transports passengers and trucks on board its shuttles the eurotunnel groups
     commitments are governed by its general conditions of carriage

within its rail freight transport and industrialsite management business europorte to secure its activity and reduce the risk of
dependency on a few key customers has identified possibilities for diversification and growth europortes commercial policy seeks to
mitigate risks of dependency on a few customers or sectors of activity by diversifying the customer portfolio and developing growth
opportunities in the infrastructure management market

financial partners
the obligations related to the groups term loan are described in chapter 22 of this registration document these obligations
combined with the level of the eurotunnel groups debt could affect its ability to obtain additional financing in the future and limit its
ability to react to changes that affect its business or the markets in which it operates the loans and other financing could become
subject to early repayment in full should the group fail to meet certain of its contractual obligations or in the event of occurrence of the
events or defaults mentioned in chapter 22 and note u to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration
document

as part of the procedures for the management of these risks the finance department continually monitors the groups commitments
and restrictions within the framework of the treasury risk management committee


significant legal proceedings
the eurotunnel group is now and could be in the future involved in certain administrative or judicial proceedings the most significant
current or potential proceedings are described in section 208 of this registration document

more generally it cannot be ruled out that in the future new legal proceedings whether related to ongoing proceedings or not could be
brought against any of the eurotunnel groups entities were such proceedings to have an unfavourable outcome they could have an
adverse impact on the business financial position or results of the eurotunnel group


the main shareholder of get se holds a significant percentage of the capital and voting rights
gs infrastructure partners gsip holds through various funds a significant ownership interest in the capital of get se as indicated in
chapter 18 of this registration document

consequently it could be in a position to exert influence at the general meeting on the groups corporate decisions requiring shareholder
approval the election and dismissal of members of the board of directors the distribution of dividends changes to the articles of
association and decisions to undertake important operations for the group including new issues of equity securities however the
organisation of corporate governance within the group number of independent board members board committees as described in
chapter 16 of this registration document is another way to moderate this risk

4 risk factors

     numerous at the same time the groups activities and processes are becoming increasingly dependent on information systems
     information system failures could result in losses or leaks of data delays or additional costs posing a risk to the groups strategy
     or image

     these risks are addressed through functional technical and legal security measures securing smartphones automatic detection of
     security vulnerabilities on group servers annual intrusion tests and so on system redundancy contingency plans and recovery plans
     are in place for strategic systems moreover the concessionaires that generate a large part of their revenue online and are considered to
     be a critical infrastructure operator are subject to particular audit and control obligations in terms of information system security




     43 insurance

     the eurotunnel groups insurance programmes consist primarily of policies covering material damage and business interruption
     including terrorism and thirdparty liability

     for the fixed link the material damage and business interruption policy including terrorism is composed of two layers of c400 million
     and c300 million respectively providing total cover of c700 million the first layer was renegotiated and renewed on 1 january 2015 for a
     period of three years ending on 31 december 2017 the second layer was renewed on 1 january 2015 for a period of one year ending
     on 31 december 2015 premiums are paid annually

     the eurotunnel groups thirdparty liability policy excluding specific programmes was renewed on 1 january 2014 for two years
     ending 31 december 2015

     the dedicated insurance programme for epf epp and socorail which was already in place has been renewed for the period
     1 december 2014 to 30 november 2015 it includes cover for material damage and business interruption thirdparty liability and
     environmental damage

     in certain circumstances payments by insurance companies under existing insurance guarantees may not be sufficient to cover all of
     the loss suffered losses in excess of the agreed indemnity limits or the application of deductibles or certain exclusion clauses could
     result in the eurotunnel group incurring unforeseen costs or could affect its business financial position or results

     in addition changes to the insurance market and the occurrence of operational incidents could lead to an adverse change in the
     eurotunnel groups insurance programme and the terms and conditions of such insurance such as the level of premiums the level of
     insurance deductibles and the scope of any exclusions which could have an adverse impact on the eurotunnel groups business
     financial position or results

     as part of these risks management procedures the group constantly monitors the adequacy of coverage and actions to be undertaken

515 important events in the development of the business of get se

maritime activity procedure before the uk competition and markets authority
seafrance was liquidated on 9 january 2012 in july 2012 eurotunnel purchased three ferries as part of the asset disposal procedure
conducted by the french tribunal de commerce and subcontracted the operation of the ferries to an independent company scop
seafrance the ferries are owned by three subsidiaries of eurotransmanche holding sas and the commercial activity is carried out by
another subsidiary of eurotransmanche holding sas myferrylink sas

on 9 january 2015 the competition appeal tribunal rejected the appeal made by the eurotunnel group and scop seafrance and
confirmed the decision of the competition and markets authority that the eurotunnel group must cease operating these ferries out of
the port of dover within the next six months the decision of the competition and markets authority was based on the assumption that
the eurotunnel group had acquired seafrances business an interpretation that the group has always contested

the eurotunnel group decided not to appeal this decision and announced that it intends to seek a buyer for myferrylink and the three
ferries due to the condition imposed by the tribunal de commerce at the time of their purchase in 2012 prohibiting the sale of the ferries
within a period of five years any such sale before 2017 would need to be authorised by the tribunal

      the installation of the gsmr approximately c28 million
      the programme to renovate and increase the engine power of 18 locomotives from 56 to 7 mw at a cost of around c22 million
        which gave the eurotunnel group a 44strong fleet of 7 mw locomotives at the end of 2013 in order to better able to handle the

      the replacement of rails in the tunnel approximately c14 million
      the entry into service of the gsmp in the north tunnel which is an important element in improving the offer to customers by enabling
        them to use mobile communications services from french or british telecoms operators whilst in the tunnel on shuttles and
        passenger trains approximately c12 million
      the terminal 2015 project an ambitious programme to develop truck traffic which aims to increase capacity by improving the
        management of the flow of trucks by the addition of a buffer storage area to enable a quick transit as well as an increased access at
        checkin in folkestone the terminal 2015 project includes the creation of new lanes before checkin and new checkin booths the
        capacity to accommodate trucks will increase with the construction of a secured parking area for 350 vehicles at coquelles

522 significant future investments

investment projects planned for 2015 fall into three categories those undertaken in response to outside constraints those to replace
existing equipment before it becomes obsolete and those to improve the groups performance each project has a level of flexibility in
terms of scope and phasing which may be adjusted as circumstances change

in the current economic environment and given the risk of increased competition in the crosschannel market these investments are for
the most part essential to sustaining the competitiveness and market shares of the eurotunnel groups activities

the project to equip the tunnel with gsmr continues and requires a total investment estimated at c48 million of which c10 million is in
2015 this project is to meet obligations under the european directive on interoperability of the european networks and will allow the
circulation of trains run by new entrants including deutsche bahn

two major projects which are required to meet environmental regulations and which form part of the groups sustainable development
are currently being studied for 2015
 the replacement of chillers for tunnel cooling plant and air conditioning systems using r22 gas the handling of which is prohibited
   from 1 january 2015 and
 the replacement of the fireextinguishing gas halon 1301 a contributor to the depletion of the ozone layer used in firefighting
   systems onboard locomotives in the service tunnel and in buildings on the terminals

replacement projects in 2015 include the continued replacement of rails in the tunnel some track switches the floors of some truck
shuttles and couplings on the passenger shuttles locomotives and on truck shuttle loader wagons in order to allow them to operate
under optimum conditions of reliability safety and security

intensive use and the natural life cycle of rolling stock lead to deterioration in some of the wagon equipment to remedy this several
programmes to study modernisation and replacement have been launched such as on the passenger shuttle loader wagons on the
fire doors and on the air conditioning units

other projects are designed to boost the business performance capacity or productivity notably including the development plan for the
shuttle activities
 the comprehensive redevelopment of the french and british terminals including equipping and developing the parking used by
   customers of the truck shuttle service from the summer of 2015
 the purchase and commissioning of three new truck shuttles from the autumn of 2016 following a european tender process this
   order which represents an investment of approximately c40 million was awarded to wbn waggonbau niesky gmbh this order is
   for the construction of three new truck shuttles each measuring 800 metres long and comprising 32 transport wagons three
   loading wagons and a carriage for the transportation of truck drivers these new truck shuttles will benefit from the latest
   technological advances in order to ensure both energy savings and also robustness and reliability delivery is expected from the end
   of 2016 and in 2017
 the redevelopment of the allocation areas and the construction of new buildings to welcome flexiplus customers on the french and
   uk terminals

the eleclink project in which get se holds a 49 share has received authorisations as described in section 642 of this registration
document the investment required for this project will be financed by equity and debt raised by eleclink in accordance with terms and
conditions which have not yet been determined

61 introduction

get se the groups listed holding company controls the two channel tunnel concessionaires and europorte sas in relation to rail
freight transport activities and eurotransmanche holding sas in relation to ship rental and sale of crossings

the two concessionaires operate the tunnel in accordance with the treaty of canterbury and the concession agreement the treaty of
canterbury signed on 12 february 1986 authorised the construction and operation of the fixed link by private concessionaire
companies and established the framework of the concession agreement which was signed on 14 march 1986

under the terms of the concession agreement the states granted the concessionaires the right and obligation to design finance build
and operate the fixed link between france and the united kingdom for an initial period of 55 years this term was extended by 10 years
in 1994 and by a further 34 years in 1999 the concession agreement thus extended will expire in 2086 the main provisions of the
treaty of canterbury and the concession agreement are described in chapter 22 of this registration document

the concessionaires operate the system which links france and the united kingdom and comprises three tunnels each approximately
50 kilometres long which run mostly under the channel along with the folkesotne terminal in the united kingdom and the coquelles
terminal in france the fixed equipment and related installations two of the tunnels are singletrack rail tunnels which in normal service
are used by trains travelling in one direction only the third tunnel which for most of its length runs between the two main rail tunnels
provides a safe means of emergency evacuation and access for tunnel maintenance there are also four crossing points between the
rail tunnels so that when maintenance work is being done on a section of one tunnel trains can switch to the other

the system is directly linked to the british and french motorway networks with the folkestone and coquelles terminals the departure
and arrival points for vehicles using the shuttle services shopping and catering facilities are available to customers at each terminal the
system is also linked to the french and british railway networks in particular to their highspeed lines all rail traffic in the system is
controlled from railway control centres at the french and british terminals

the holding company europorte sas groups all the rail freight transport subsidiaries europorte segment providing a wide range of
integrated rail freight services including national and international haulage local services for secondary lines and services to industry
individual junction management infrastructure maintenance and wagon loading and unloading

the holding company eurotransmanche holding sas groups all the maritime subsidiaries myferrylink maritime segment owning
three vessels which are operated commercially using a series of charter agreements under which scop seafrance is responsible for
the equipment and nautical management of the vessels on the sea route between the ports of calais in france and dover in the
united kingdom and which are marketed by the subsidiary myferrylink sas

in 2014 eurotunnel group earned its revenue from three main sources
 the fixed link activities mainly
     the shuttle service le shuttle for both the transport of trucks and the transport of cars motor homes caravans coaches
      motorcycles and trailers on its passenger shuttles
     payments made for use of the railway network by highspeed passenger trains eurostar and by train operators rail freight
      services

6 description of the eurotunnel groups activities

     62 crosschannel activities

     621 main markets

     the eurotunnel group operates in the transport market between continental europe and the united kingdom it offers i a shuttle
     service between calais and folkestone and which competes directly with ferry operators between dover and the continent in the
     transport of passengers cars coaches and trucks and ii a railway network on which railway companies can run rail freight trains and
     highspeed passenger trains and iii at the time of writing of this registration document a maritime transport service between dover
     and the continent under the myferrylink brand in direct competition with other ferry operators and shuttle services between calais
     and folkestone


     a freight market
     freight traffic between continental europe and the united kingdom is commonly divided into four distinct modes
      rollonrolloff accompanied trucks and trailers crossing the channel or the north sea on shuttles or ferries at the same time as
         the road tractor and driver mostly via the short straits
      rollonrolloff unaccompanied trailers crossing the channel or the north sea independently of the road tractor mostly via north
         sea routes
      rail freight conventional or intermodal trains running through the tunnel and
      liftonliftoff moveable containers or swap bodies loaded on liftonliftoff container ships mostly on the north sea routes

     the market is based on three corridors
      the short straits all routes from continental europe to dover folkestone and ramsgate including the tunnel
      the english channel all routes from continental europe to ports on the south coast of the united kingdom to the southwest of
        folkestone and
      the north sea all routes from continental europe to ports on the east coast of the united kingdom to the north of ramsgate
        including the thames estuary

     the modal distribution varies by geographic zone for accompanied trucks the long trip across the english channel or the even longer
     trip across the north sea is costly these routes are more suitable for rollonrolloff unaccompanied and liftonliftoff solutions

     by contrast the shorter crossing times of the short straits are more appropriate to timesensitive traffic and attract a much larger share
     of rollonrolloff accompanied traffic

     short straits
     in the freight market the truck shuttle service is in direct competition with ferry operators on the accompanied road transport route
     across the short straits including myferrylink

     over the last 15 years there has been a marked shift towards the use of accompanied trucks in the freight market between continental
     europe and the united kingdom the trend in favour of accompanied trucks has now come to an end and market shares between the
     routes are now relatively stable

     however the rollonrolloff accompanied mode on the short straits routes still continues to grow because it provides the shortest
     and quickest route for crossing the channel

     the short straits truck shuttles and ferries share of the freight market rose on the back of the success of the rollonrolloff
     accompanied mode reflecting
      the lack of major development in crosschannel rail freight and
      capacity increases and changes in pricing policies by the various operators

     the freight market continued to grow in 2013 and 2014 with estimated growths respectively of 47 and of 79 compared with the
     previous year to achieve for the fiscal year 2014 a total short straits market at a level higher than that observed in 2007 before the
     economic crisis and in particular the economic slowdown in the united kingdom

     since 1st january 2015 pursuant to directive 200533ec of the parliament and the council of the european union which imposes
     controlled emissions areas for sulphur covering the english channel the north sea and the baltic all ferry operators in the north sea
     and the english channel must meet stricter limits on sulphur emissions and for that they have two alternatives

b passenger market
until 2008 the international passenger transport market from and to the united kingdom grew steadily the impact of the global
economic environment largely reversed this trend between 2009 and 2012 the passenger market achieved significant growth in 2013
and again in 2014 compared with the previous year mainly during the summer period source international passenger survey
estimates

the passenger shuttle service and the myferrylink maritime service transport passengers travelling with their vehicles between calais
folkestone and dover they are in direct competition with ferry operators in the short straits market the transport services for
passengers travelling without their vehicles provided by airlines or by highspeed passenger trains constitute a marginal and indirect
source of competition to these two services

eurostar services principally operate in the market for transporting passengers travelling without their vehicles between paris and
london and between brussels and london eurostars main competitors are airlines


short straits
during the 1990s this market was characterised in particular by a high proportion of day trips with passengers attracted by dutyfree
purchases or other economic benefits these advantages having disappeared the number of day trips on the short straits route is on a
sustained downward trend however both the number of longstay five days and over and shortstay fewer than five days trips
increased as a result of
 the withdrawal of passenger services on other crosschannel routes which led to a transfer of traffic to the short straits
 the adoption of dynamic pricing by some operators particularly the eurotunnel group for its maritime services and shuttle services
 airline pricing policies and an end to the steady fall in air fares and
 airport disruption and delays

the car market declined significantly in 2012 partially offset by oneoff events such as the diamond jubilee and the 2012 london
olympic games in june august and september the market contracted by 24 in 2012 compared with 2011 in 2013 the car market
significantly recovered by about 28 compared with 2012 mainly during peak periods the summer and school holidays in the
united kingdom in 2014 the short straits market grew by 15 compared to 2013


c competitive position in the short straits market
the shuttle services and the myferrylink maritime service are in direct competition with the ferry services operated by po ferries and
dfds seaways they compete indirectly with airlines and to a lesser extent with eurostar


i  ferry operators
crosschannel ferry operators are using larger ships to handle greater volumes of traffic and to achieve economies of scale over the long
term looking for growth in the freight market rather than in the passenger market cars

the project calais port 2015 aimed at merging the ports of calais and boulognesurmer and the extension of the port of calais in
particular the ferry terminal was assigned a public service contract signed by the nord pas de calais region on 19 february 2015
source nord littoral 19 february 2015 the port of dover plans to create a new terminal in the western docks to accommodate
larger ferries

following the withdrawal of hoverspeed in october 2005 speedferries in november 2008 ld lines in september 2010 and the
liquidation of seafrance in january 2012 the eurotunnel groups main competitors are po and dfds seaways

po
po ferries po is a subsidiary of dp world a worldwide operator of port facilities

po is the most important ferry operator on the short straits with five vessels and is in direct competition with eurotunnel group both in
the freight market and in the passenger market

po operates up to five vessels pride of kent pride of burgundy spirit of britain spirit of france and european seaway two of which
are new and at 210 metres are the longest ships deployed on routes to and from dover

     dfds seaways
     norfolkline dfds seaways is owned by the danish company dfds

     in 2013 dfds seaways had three ships operating on the doverdunkirk link all delivered between 2005 and 2006 they have a lower
     passenger capacity than those traditionally used by po ferries

     once seafrance ceased trading ld lines norman spirit was transferred from le havre to bolster dfdss fleet on the dunkirkdover
     route since 17 february 2012 dfds seaways has been running a service between calais and dover in 2013 and 2014 dfds
     seaways operated two vessels on the dovercalais link norman spirit and the former moliere of seafrance1


     myferrylink
     the myferrylink maritime service is described in section 625


     ii shuttle services
     competitive advantages of the shuttle service
     the eurotunnel group considers that under normal operating conditions its shuttle service benefits from considerable competitive
     advantages over ferries even though certain market segments are inaccessible to it notably outofgauge vehicles and certain
     dangerous goods these competitive advantages are as follows
      speed the standard travel time between the french and british motorways is much shorter than via the ferries
      departure frequency the eurotunnel groups shuttle service runs more frequently than any of its competitors and it runs every day
         of the year
      reliability the shuttle service unlike the ferries is unaffected by sailing conditions and is not dependent on the weather and
      environmentally friendly the electric power it uses for traction generates much lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels

     eurotunnels shuttle service also offers
      a freight service that is independent of the passenger service which has a peak tourist season
      more efficient management of loadingunloading and
      the direct management of its terminals in contrast to the ferries for which port operations are managed by third parties

     eurotunnel group considers that the maritime transport service under the myferrylink brand while completely different from the shuttle
     service offers its customers a lowercost alternative with the same eurotunnel group standards in terms of security safety and
     customer service


     iii airlines
     airlines and particularly lowcost airlines also have an indirect impact on the short straits market these companies serve many
     destinations in continental europe and thus compete with operators in the short straits including the passenger shuttle service in the
     shortstay leisure market many destinations in france are now served by lowcost airlines offering an alternative means of transport
     between france and the united kingdom


     iv eurostar
     to a lesser extent eurostars highspeed passenger trains compete indirectly with the passenger shuttle service in the leisure market


     622 fixed link activities

     the eurotunnel group operates and directly markets a shuttle service through the tunnel and also manages the safe and efficient
     passage of highspeed passenger trains and of the train operators rail freight services on the railway network


     a shuttle transport activities
     the eurotunnel groups sales marketing and operations strategy is focused on clearly differentiating its product from that of its
     competitors this strategy aims to ensure outstanding service quality and optimum security and involves the following key measures
      constant alignment of supply with demand to optimise revenue per shuttle
      commercial strategies providing a product offering even better suited to customers needs and
      cost control achieved through programmes to optimise maintenance and production management cycles and as well as the main
        subcontracting agreements the areas in which eurotunnel group uses subcontractors are described in section 1721 i of this

this business model focuses on operating margins and seeks to maximise profitability rather than to increase volume and market share

i    truck shuttle service
introduction
the truck shuttle service carries trucks between france and the united kingdom on shuttle trains in each terminal drivers pass
through dedicated checkin security and border control facilities other facilities for trucks are located close to the terminals drivers and
their passengers do not remain in their vehicles during the crossing but travel in a separate carriage club car specially designed for
this purpose these club cars have been completely refurbished in a campaign that ended in 2014 cosy atmosphere more comfort
and greater seating capacity

the eurotunnel group has 15 truck shuttles six of which have capacity for 31 trucks and nine have capacity for 32 trucks thus
enabling the group to operate up to six departures per hour in each direction

on 15 january 2015 eurotunnel group announced the order of three new truck shuttles which will be added to the 15 existing shuttles
this enhanced fleet will enable eurotunnel group to increase its capacity by 20 and move to a frequency at peak period of eight
departures per hour compared to the current six it involves the construction of three new truck shuttles with a capacity of 32 trucks
the new shuttles will benefit from the latest technological developments to ensure both energy savings as well as robustness and
reliability their delivery is scheduled for late 2016 to 2017


strategy
truck service marketing strategy
the strategy is based on an optimisation of truck shuttle revenue and a pricing policy that reflects the value of the service provided by
the eurotunnel group as well as its speed ease and reliability

throughout the year the eurotunnel group gives priority to customers under contract only providing transport to occasional customers
as available capacity allows as part of the project vision 2020 eurotunnel group is working on optimising the truck shuttle revenue
with a project adjusting the pricing policy based on more flexible prices adjustable according to demand and capacity available in order
to encourage an improved distribution of truck flows throughout the week and during the day so that capacity and occupancy rate can
be optimised while maintaining service quality during peak days


truck shuttle service market share
the eurotunnel group estimates that its share of the truck shuttle service market on the short straits corridor has evolved as follows

                                                                               2014                                          2013
                                                                                      market share
                                                                      vehicles          estimate                 vehicles         market share
                           
    accompanied trucks                                             1440214                  378              1362849                  386

     number of accompanied trucks transported by the truck shuttle service the market share percentages are derived by calculating the truck shuttle
      services accompanied truck traffic as a proportion of the total of such traffic on the short straits market as reported by irn services ltd


2012 was marked by the absence of the traditional operator seafrance and the resulting redistribution of traffic as well as by additional
traffic generated by the london olympic games the market share of truck shuttles therefore continued to rise reaching 435 for the
year a record since the fixed link was opened the introduction of the myferrylink maritime service as well as the new calaisdover
service provided by dfds helped to reestablish at the port of calais a range of transport services comparable to that which existed
before the departure of the traditional operator seafrance

the resulting partial redistribution of traffic resulted in a significant fall in market share of the truck shuttle service in 2013 which stood at
386 for the year comparable to that of 2007 the 2014 financial year was marked by an increased competition from ferry operators
based on prices which led to a slight decrease in the market share of the truck shuttle service business to 378 for the period


ii passenger shuttle service le shuttle
introduction
the passenger shuttle service carries cars motor homes caravans coaches motorcycles and trailers between france and the
united kingdom on shuttles tickets can be bought in advance at wwweurotunnelcom by telephone from the customer service
centre from travel agents and on arrival at checkin customers remain in their vehicle throughout the crossing which normally lasts
approximately 35 minutes from platform to platform each passenger shuttle has two sections a doubledeck section mainly for cars
and motorcycles and a singledeck section reserved for vehicles higher than 185 metres mainly coaches minibuses and cars with roof
boxes or towing caravans

                                                                                                                                                         27


6 description of the eurotunnel groups activities

     the eurotunnel group has nine passenger shuttles able to carry up to 180 cars or 120 cars and 12 coaches the passenger shuttle
     service can operate up to five departures per hour in each direction

     strategy
     the business model aims to optimise passenger shuttle revenue by increasing the average revenue per shuttle departure


     pricing policy dynamic pricing
     the groups pricing system calculates and adjusts ticket prices according to departure time and shuttle load factor this policy
     optimises passenger revenue and the average ticket price for passenger vehicles cars motor homes caravans motorcycles etc

     currently le shuttle customer bookings made online represent more than 80 of bookings a new booking module for le shuttle was
     deployed in november 2014 allowing for example smart phones applications and a new reservation module for tour and coach
     operators which will be deployed in the fourth quarter of 2015


     adapting capacity to demand
     the capacity of the passenger shuttle service is constantly adjusted to improve loading rates and reduce costs several operational
     changes have been made to continuously improve this strategy such as better distribution of shuttle departures during the day fewer
     passenger shuttles running at offpeak times and more during peak times and the introduction of more flexibility in train crew
     management

     over the medium term this policy has allowed the eurotunnel group to optimise the load factor which went from 45 in 2004 to 60
     in 2014


     customer experience
     as a service business eurotunnel le shuttle puts the customer at the centre of its strategy and implements ways to enhance their
     satisfaction and loyalty two main areas of progress are being developed
      realtime information for each customer at every stage of their experience with eurotunnel group and
      individualisation of the service that is to say consideration of the specific needs of customer segments such as for example
         owners of electric vehicles and those travelling with their pets since autumn 2014 crew members scan the bar code printed on the
         hangers of each vehicle on board the passenger shuttle this system identifies each customer on board the passenger shuttle and
         provides realtime personalised information it enables eurotunnel to have meaningful data on the service offered to customers such
         as actual transit time compliance with departure time or position in the shuttle

     as part of the vision 2020 project described in section 624 of this registration document one of the themes is customer information in
     realtime this is made up of three goals to provide any relevant information to each customer to refine knowledge of customer
     expectations and to accurately measure the satisfaction of each customer


     passenger shuttle service market share
     the eurotunnel group estimates that its share of the car and coach passenger markets on the short straits were as follows

                                                                                        2014                                           2013

                                                                             vehicles           estimated                  vehicles         market share
         cars                                                            2572263                   515              2481167                   505
         coaches                                                           63059                   395                 64507                   416

          number of vehicles transported by the passenger shuttle service the market share percentages are calculated by converting the number of vehicles
           transported into car equivalent units ceu and determining the passenger shuttle services share of total ceu transported on the short straits as
           reported by irn services ltd
         number of vehicles transported by the passenger shuttle service the market share percentages are calculated by determining the passenger shuttle
           services share of the total number of coaches transported on the short straits as reported by irn services ltd


     in a market growing by 15 points compared to 2013 the constant increase in traffic has resulted in increased market share the market
     share for the car business of the passenger shuttle service was 515 for the year which is higher than in 2012

b railway network
in 2014 eurotunnel group earned 25 of its revenue 36 of fixed link revenue from the use of the railway network by highspeed
passenger trains and train operators rail freight services the eurotunnel group does not operate these trains but manages their safe
and efficient passage through the tunnel infrastructure

the use of the tunnel by the railway companies is governed by the railway usage contract with the national railways which is in force
until 2052 under this charging framework the railways are obliged to pay to the eurotunnel group fixed annual charges and variable
charges according to the number of passengers on highspeed passenger trains the variable charges are determined according to a
toll formula that applies throughout the life of the railway usage contract and which takes into account the effects of inflation to a
certain extent in addition the railways are required to contribute to the operating costs of the system as well as to investment costs
relating to the modernisation of equipment

a simplified pricing mechanism for freight trains has been put in place with charging per freight train instead of charging per tonne of
freight this scale is published annually by the eurotunnel group in its network statement which sets out access conditions to its
railway network implementing the charging framework of the railway usage contract for all railway companies for the operation of
highspeed passenger trains and freight trains

the eurotunnel groups revenue for its railway network depends solely on receiving variable charges payable according to the number
of passengers transported by the eurostar highspeed passenger trains and the number of freight trains as well as the annual fixed
charges as well as the contribution made by the railways to operating costs

in 2014 the eurotunnel group generated c305 million of revenue from the use of its railway network

         market share percentages are derived by calculating the volume of rail passengers as a proportion of the total volume of air and rail passenger traffic
           between paris and london and between brussels and london as provided by the caa brb and sncf


     the share held by eurostar highspeed passenger trains in the passenger market for the parislondon route has reduced slightly to
     784 on average for 2014 compared to 797 for 2013 over the same period their market share on the londonbrussels route fell
     slightly from 839 to 818

     the competitive environment of highspeed passenger trains eurostar
     in the business travel market eurostars highspeed passenger trains compete with the traditional and lowcost airlines that offer
     regular flights between paris and london and between brussels and london in the leisure travel market eurostars main competitors
     are the lowcost airlines not only on the routes served by eurostar but also to other destinations eurostar has taken several successful
     initiatives in terms of marketing and special offers over the internet targeting the leisure travel segment the subsidiary of sncf
     confirmed the schedule for the opening of new destinations in 2015 and 2016

     in this context of the liberalisation of the international rail passenger transport market on 1 january 2010 the eurotunnel group
     responded by publishing in its network statement its efficient and nondiscriminatory conditions for access and offers new entrants the
     option to operate crosschannel highspeed passenger train services in competition with eurostar and the airline sector to existing or
     new destinations

     highspeed passenger trains eurostar
     eurostars highspeed passenger train services are jointly operated by eurostar international limited now 55 owned by sncf 40
     owned by london and continental railways limited which is under the control of the british government as is brb and 5 owned by
     sncb the british government announced that they had reached an agreement with a consortium of cdpq the caisse de depot et
     placement du quebec and hermes infrastructure for the sale of the 40 holding they have in eurostar

     since 2007 when high speed 1 and the london terminal at st pancras international opened the eurostar highspeed passenger train
     service has used a highspeed line between london and the eurotunnel groups uk terminal this line improves service reliability and
     reduces the transit time between paris and london or brussels and london by around 20 minutes in addition st pancras international
     station improves rail links with northern england due to the proximity of rail services from st pancras kings cross and euston stations
     ebbsfleet international station located near the m25 london orbital motorway also allows eurostars operators to expand their
     catchment area

     in 2014 eurostar ran 14 to 18 departures in each direction between paris and london and seven to ten trains in each direction between
     london and brussels on business days with adjustments depending on the day the season and the destination some trains make
     intermediate stops at ebbsfleet or ashford international in the united kingdom and at calaisfrethun or lilleeurope in france eurostar
     also runs a service to disneyland paris five days a week and a seasonal direct service from london and ashford to bourg saintmaurice
     from december to april and to avignon from july to september

     in 2014 the number of eurostar passengers going through the tunnel rose by 26 to 104 million compared with 2013 source
     eurostar

     in november 2014 eurostar announced the order of seven additional trains from siemens which together with the ten trains already
     ordered in 2010 makes a total of 17 trains the first of these 17 e320 trains with distributed power will come into service in late 2015
     more comfortable and faster than the existing trains with a top speed of 320 kmh they can accommodate 900 passengers ie 20
     more eurostar international limited has confirmed the launch of a new direct service from london to lyon avignon and marseille from
     may 2015 open for bookings since december 2014 and to be operated throughout the year at the rate of one to five round trips per
     week depending on the season eurostar international limited has also announced its intention to operate a new service between
     london and amsterdam from december 2016

united kingdom

the freight volume transported by the train operators rail freight services is summarised below

competitive environment of train operators rail freight services
rail freight through the tunnel originally developed by staterun railways initially had disappointing results and organisational difficulties
which resulted in a drop in traffic from 3 million tonnes to 1 million tonnes between 1998 and 2007 international rail freight is also held
back by inadequate national infrastructure train gauge and length quality and availability of paths distortions that favour sea or road
transport and excessive constraints whether regulatory social or technical

in order to retain and relaunch train operators rail freight services since 2007 the eurotunnel group has pursued a comprehensive
competitive strategy aimed at addressing the specific challenges in the crosschannel freight market through the implementation of
certain measures in respect of openaccess rail development border restrictions and competitive pricing policies for rail freight services
between 2007 and 2010 despite the revival of intermodal and conventional block trains the demise of conventional isolated car
services in france and in greatbritain has resulted in the loss of more than a third of crosschannel rail freight traffic marking a low of
2097 trains and 113 million of tonnes transported in 2010

in may 2013 with the aim of promoting the development of the freight train traffic of railway companies in the tunnel eurotunnel group
launched a program to help start new services etica extended in june 2014 following its positive results between 2010 and 2014
the establishment of etica contributed to the growth in traffic of around 40 38 in number of trains and 46 in tonnage transported
compared to 2010


train operators rail freight services
the train operators rail freight services between continental europe and the united kingdom are run by railway companies including
db schenker on behalf of brb sncf and its captrain subsidiaries europorte and potentially any freight train operator in open
access three different types of freight trains use the railway network
 intermodal trains composed of platform wagons transporting containers or swap bodies
 conventional trains carrying goods on pallets in enclosed wagons or bulk loads in adapted wagons such as tankers hoppers
    platforms etc making up a full train
 trains with specialised wagons for transporting new cars

rail freight trains are in competition with most modes of freight transport in operation between continental europe and the
united kingdom

in order to revive crosschannel rail freight the eurotunnel group has adopted a strategy that is based on three policies i development
of open access for all operators of rail freight trains ii dealing effectively with border restrictions and iii a simplified and competitive
pricing policy
 an average toll charge of 3000 c4500 per train in 2007 values for a train travelling at 120 kmh during an average busy period
 a simplified pricing structure one toll charge per train taking account of speed and peak and offpeak transit allowing operators to
    optimise their trainloads
 real and effective open access and the capping at c600 in 2007 values of essential crosschannel service costs dealing with
    border restrictions and specialised class 92 locomotives and
 competitive total costs compared with the road transport sector in order to encourage rail freight development

after 2010 with its repeated disruptions to rail freight and the end of single wagonload services the development of new services
between 2010 and 2014 drove an increase in traffic of 38 in the number of trains and 46 in tonnage transported compared with

6 description of the eurotunnel groups activities

     2010 including the creation of new intermodal services and an increase in the transportation of steel aluminium and vehicle
     components

     originally set up in may 2013 the success of the etica growth plan led in june 2014 to the intensification of initiatives to promote rail
     freight with the expansion of the program for assistance to etica startups both over time opening extended until 2018 and by
     expansion of eligible categories along with a 25 reduction of access charges during offpeak night periods for rail freight services so
     that these growth efforts can produce their full effect eurotunnel group has also drawn the attention of authorities to the need to
     address the barriers to development size length capacity etc on existing national networks which considerably weaken the
     competitiveness and development of crosschannel rail freight


     c other revenues
     the fixed link generated c15 million in other revenues in 2014 representing 1 of the eurotunnel groups total revenue 2 of fixed
     link revenue these other revenues consist mainly of i revenue from thirdparty retail businesses in the terminals on both sides of the
     tunnel ii revenue paid for telecommunication lines in the tunnel iii revenue related to the property business iv the sale of travel
     insurance products in the united kingdom and v revenue related to ciffco training


     i  revenue from thirdparty retail businesses
     the eurotunnel group has built facilities for its customers on its two terminals in france and the united kingdom including shops and
     other retail outlets

     access to the shops bars and restaurants is available only to customers travelling on the shuttle services they are located inside the
     terminals after checkin these facilities are operated by third parties under three to tenyear concession agreements on the french
     side and under leases on the british side

     the eurotunnel groups strategy is to offer travellers who choose to stop before making the crossing a choice and level of service
     consistent with the overall quality and value of service offered by the eurotunnel group in 2013 the victor hugo passenger terminal
     building in folkestone and the charles dickens building in coquelles were refurbished to the highest international airport standards in
     order to welcome customers in a pleasant environment

     in 1994 a contract was signed for 30 years for the operation of three petrol stations located at the entrance and exit of the two terminals

     the eurotunnel group also earns modest revenue from renting advertising boards on both terminals and around the terminal exit routes


     ii property business
     the eurotunnel group owns and manages plots of land near its french and british terminals

     as an extension of its mission to design build and operate the fixed link the eurotunnel group was also given responsibility for local
     land development the fixed link is not just a transport infrastructure it was also designed as a platform for the future economic
     development of the kent and calais regions the eurotunnel group in the interests of sustainable development has restored the site of
     the former factory where the tunnel lining segments were made which was later used as a shelter for illegal immigrants red cross
     centre this restoration work has paved the way for a major commercial and tourism development project to stand alongside the cite
     de leurope shopping centre in coquelles

     as part of efforts to strengthen its partnership with the town of sangattebleriot and the conseil general of the pasdecalais the
     eurotunnel group signed an agreement with the conseil general of the pasdecalais on 6 january 2009 covering measures to support
     this ambitious tourism development project

     as part of the responsibility for local land development given to it by the french authorities at the beginning of the fixed link project and
     in order to further boost the appeal of the pasdecalais region as a tourist destination euroimmo get a groupe eurotunnel se
     subsidiary submitted a successful bid for the land development concession for the integrated seaside ecovillage and golf course
     project at the porte des deuxcaps the concession agreement was signed on 18 february 2013

     in general terms the development of the area entrusted to euroimmo get the project supervisor encompasses all the work relating to
     roads networks open spaces and various facilities designed to meet the needs of the future occupiers owners inhabitants and users
     of the new buildings the concessionaire will manage the assets acquired until they are transferred to the builders the concession will
     last for 10 years

iii training activity ciffco the opal coast international railway training centre
ciffco is a subsidiary 100 owned by eurotunnel group expert in railway operations the ciffco centre notably makes it possible
for other rail and industrial operators to train their staff in rail and industrial trades

ciffco provides
 an experienced teaching team
 a building entirely devoted to training located near the french eurotunnel terminal in coquelles
 the latest technology highperformance simulators essential for learning to drive trains and modern computing resources notably
   allowing distance learning
 accreditations required to run its railway training centre activity to this end on 8 september 2014 ciffco obtained the renewal for
   five years of its accreditation from the french public rail safety authority epsf ciffco is also approved as a body responsible for
   examinations of general professional knowledge related to train driving

in 2014 the train driver training issued by ciffco officially entered the french national directory of professional certifications repertoire
national des certifications professionnelles francais this will therefore allow a recognised professional qualification to be issued
ciffco is now the first and only private training organisation with the capacity to deliver this qualification alongside the french public
operator


623 fixed link capacities

a the system
i   the tunnel
the number of trains or shuttles that can pass through the tunnel every hour is limited the tunnel capacity is expressed in terms of the
number of standard paths per hour in each direction a standard path is defined as the time it takes a shuttle train operating at 140 kmh
to cover that part of the system which under normal operating conditions is used by all other trains travelling through the tunnel

one of the key factors determining the tunnels capacity is the signalling system at the date of this registration document the system
permits 20 standard paths per hour in each direction under the railway usage contract trains belonging to the railways have the right
to use up to 50 of the hourly capacity in each direction highspeed passenger trains and train operators rail freight services
because of their faster or slower speeds relative to the eurotunnel groups truck and passenger shuttle services use more than one
standard path to travel through the tunnel at peak times speeds can be adjusted to maximise the number of trains and shuttles
travelling through the tunnel in 2014 the maximum number of standard paths used by passenger and truck shuttle services was ten
per hour in each direction

at the date of this registration document the tunnels capacity under normal operating conditions does not constitute a significant
constraint limiting growth in the different types of traffic

as part of its five year strategic thinking for the fixed link project vision 2020 and as indicated in section 624 of this registration
document the group is working on optimising tunnel availability itself notably by spending no more than one night per week instead of
the two at present on the maintenance of the two rail tunnels thanks to predictive maintenance tools and big data analysis a
dedicated tunnel measurement train will circulate each week to deliver a very accurate assessment of the condition of the track
catenary and other equipment eliminating long onfoot visual inspections

in the medium or long term the eurotunnel group believes that it will be possible to increase the tunnels capacity by the following
means
 setting uniform operating speeds for all trains which would allow more trains to run on the same number of standard paths at the
    date of this registration document goods trains travel in the tunnel at a speed of 100 or 120 kmh while highspeed passenger
    trains can reach a speed of 160 kmh in the tunnel these speed differentials use a large part of the system capacity because they
    require the eurotunnel group to leave greater intervals between trains than would be necessary if they all travelled at the same speed
    use of the systems capacity could therefore be improved by shifting slow or infrequent freight trains to offpeak times and by
    scheduling trains that travel at speeds higher 160 kmh or lower 120 kmh than the standard path 140 kmh so that they run in
    flights during peak hours
 increasing the power of the locomotives pulling the shuttles to allow the use of longer trains or reduce transit times
 reducing the space between trains using the tunnel to 2 minutes 30 seconds instead of 3 minutes currently so as to raise system
    capacity to 24 standard paths per hour in both directions although this would mean improving the fixed equipment and
 improving the signalling system notably with ertms this initial phase creates no additional capacity

some of these measures require approval by the igc which has supervisory authority over tunnel operation

6 description of the eurotunnel groups activities

     a dedicated optical relay system using 2g and 3g telephone and gsmp mobile internet networks enables passengers on shuttle
     services and highspeed passenger trains to use their mobile phones to make calls and access the internet this was put in place in
     the north tunnel in 2013 and in the south tunnel in 2014


     ii terminals
     currently ten boarding platforms are in service at the french terminal and ten at the british terminal

     both terminals were designed so that the number of boarding platforms could be increased to 16 in order to maintain traffic fluidity and
     to increase the number of hourly truck shuttle departures capacity at the terminals will be expanded as stated in section 624 of this
     registration document the terminal 2015 project notably includes the development of a secure parking area for approximately
     370 trucks in coquelles and an increase in the number of toll booths and in the number of access lanes to the checkin barriers

     the terminals have self checkin lanes for all customers along with an automatic number plate recognition system these systems
     improve traffic flow and reduce operating costs in a constant drive to improve the quality of service the coquelles and folkestone
     terminal buildings have been refurbished a play area with a variety of play equipment and a digital display screen was created in the
     charles dickens building in coquelles meanwhile the victor hugo building in folkestone was given awardwinning sanitary facilities a
     prayer room and special facilities for severely disabled people


     b rolling stock
     plans to develop the shuttle fleet are described in section 624 of this registration document


     c railway services passenger and rail freight
     under the railway usage contract trains using the railway network are entitled to use up to 50 of the total capacity of the tunnel that
     is allowed by the signalling system this currently amounts to ten standard paths per hour in each direction for highspeed passenger
     trains eurostar and new entrants and train operators rail freight services goods trains currently transport an average load of about
     500 to 600 tonnes each although some of them can transport up to 1000 tonnes of freight and travel at speeds varying between 100
     and 120 kmh an increase in the average load or the travel speed of goods trains would allow the railway companies to increase freight
     train traffic without additional use of the tunnels capacity similarly increasing load factors on highspeed passenger trains those of
     eurostar and new market entrants and synchronising them so that they run in flights would enable more passengers to be transported
     without using additional tunnel capacity under the terms of the railway usage contract the eurotunnel group may use any surplus
     capacity not used by the railway companies if they have not confirmed their capacity requirement by the previous day use of this
     surplus capacity provides the eurotunnel group with additional flexibility in optimising the flow of traffic and scheduling passenger and
     freight trains and shuttle service departures


     624 fixed link system reliability

     a tunnel availability and maintenance
     scheduled weekly maintenance of the tunnel is planned and structured so as to promote efficient use of the tunnel and cause minimal
     disruption to commercial operations

     the eurotunnel group has set itself an objective of limiting service disruptions due to fixed equipment failure to less than 075 despite
     continual traffic growth in 2014 tunnel availability was 9977 compared with 9971 in 2013

     the operational plan aiming to restrict fire risk salamander plan along with the creation of fire fighting stations safe help to protect
     the infrastructure in case of fire on board a truck shuttle this plan proved effective on 17 january 2015 when the teams had to deal with
     a small fire on a truck and a section of catenary that had fallen the implementation of the salamander plan enabled the fire to be rapidly
     contained and damage to be limited


     b rail replacement
     rails on the terminals are replaced as part of the routine maintenance programme without major disruption to commercial services the
     strategy implemented has reduced costs without harming the quality of the track this strategy aims to avoid systematically replacing
     both lines of rails but only those rails that are worn or that present defects

     the third in tunnel rail replacement campaign began in 2014 and will be completed early 2016 the first 33 kilometres were laid in 2014
     the laying of 67 additional kilometres will take place in 2015 and 2016 this work is taken advantage of to inspect the hammer beams
     concrete parts on which the rail rests thirtythree kilometres of track will be replaced each year on friday saturday and sunday nights

over 11 weekends at the start of each year it is intended that resin rails will be installed along the 11 km of the tunnel which are most
susceptible to corrosion


c maintenance and availability of rolling stock
the eurotunnel group has also set itself the objective of achieving better utilisation of its transport capacity by improving load factors on
its rolling stock this is in addition to improving the availability of the rolling stock by modifying maintenance procedures in order to
optimise periods of operation between maintenance visits

the repair and maintenance programmes implemented by the eurotunnel group have helped to improve the reliability of the electric
locomotives and truck and passenger shuttles in planning its maintenance programmes the eurotunnel groups objectives are
the following
 ensure that safety requirements are met
 avoid rolling stock being out of service for prolonged periods and
 maximise the number of shuttles available at peak hours

under current maintenance programmes light maintenance and safety inspections are carried out every 44 days or 30000 km for the
locomotives truck shuttles and passenger shuttles every 600 to 1200 days depending on the vehicle and the number of kilometres it
has covered each shuttle is taken out of service for six weeks to undergo an extensive preventive maintenance programme

the departure cancellation rate for passenger shuttle services due to faults in rolling stock was 14 in 2014 stable compared to 2013
the departure cancellation rate for truck shuttle services due to faults in rolling stock was 14 in 2014 while it was 16 in 2013 the
number of stops in the tunnel due to faults in rolling stock was 26 in 2014 compared with 37 in 2013 the eurotunnel group is
implementing simplification and renovation programmes aimed at further reducing future maintenance requirements and improving
reliability

the goal of the lsm large scale maintenance programme is to
 meet safety requirements bogie brake coupling batteries etc
 restore and improve the reliability of systems that have reached about a third or half of their overall potential canopy sdl
   hydraulic etc
 extend the life of wagons breda floors arbel floors etc and
 ensure customer comfort air conditioning toilets interiors etc


d maintenance strategy
the time tunnel infrastructure maintenance excellence programme has led to a reduction in overnight maintenance from three to two
nights per weekend since september 2012 as a result of reduced subcontracting costs optimisation of maintenance times and
efficient working methods this optimisation is ongoing and since early 2013 maintenance work on the terminals on friday and
saturday nights has been limited and is now transparent for commercial operation and all of the tunnels capacity is fully available
for customers

the process of optimising the rolling stock maintenance strategy has continued its aims are
 to improve the availability performance and quality of the shuttles
 to increase processing capacity and so minimise the total cost of maintenance and
 to rationalise technical choices and industrial resources

this process is based on several lines of work
 the extension of the light and indepth preventive maintenance cycles both for truck shuttles and for passenger shuttles which has
   a significant impact on the availability of shuttles and processing capacity
 the technical redesign of maintenance on systems with a high impact on performance and quality focusing on the relevance of
   maintenance instructions and the implementation of appropriate lsm programmes and
 the optimisation of key processes such as corrective maintenance reprofiling and axle replacement with improvement in the
   efficiency of human industrial and it resources


e projects
in 2014 the eurotunnel group finished its locomotive renovation and powerincrease programme with 18 additional units which brings
the fleet of 7 mw locomotives to 44

various projects are planned in the short or medium term to further improve system reliability and efficiency including the project
terminal 2015 work on which began in the summer of 2014 on the two terminals and will be completed during the summer of 2015

6 description of the eurotunnel groups activities

     concerning the french side of the terminal the work first focuses on the creation before registration of a buffer storage area
     equipped with five lanes from the entrance onto the site up to the tolls where the number of lanes will increase to six instead of the four at
     present second major investment in the french terminal the construction of a secure parking for 370 trucks featuring a rest area
     restaurant and a petrol station this equipment will be managed by the operator of the adjacent motorway

     concerning the british side of the terminal the infrastructure developments are designed to separate the flow of trucks from that of the
     cars that will run on the ten existing lanes the trucks will have five new lanes before checkin

     more broadly as part of a collaborative dynamic eurotunnel group decided to define and orientate the fixed link strategy for the next
     five years identifying issues and challenges and deciding on goals to be achieved by 2020 project vision 2020

     as part of this improved performance over the long term seven working groups have been set up to bring together seven large
     transverse and collaborative themes including
      fluidity of the terminals the project aims to increase the hosting capacity of the terminals while reducing transit time between the
         arrival of a customer on the site and their boarding a passenger or truck shuttle
      improving the availability of rolling stock the three third generation truck shuttles ordered in early 2015 will benefit from the latest
         technical advances on the shuttle side the loss of capacity due to the departure on midlife maintenance of a passenger shuttle in
         2017 will be offset by developments on the other eight passenger shuttles

     625 myferrylink maritime activities

     the eurotunnel groups myferrylink maritime subsidiaries own three ships they lease their ships to a scop an operating company
     outside the eurotunnel group and market the crosschannel crossings for freight and passenger vehicles

     the eurotunnel group has entered into lease agreements with the scop which operates the ferries on the short straits route in turn
     the eurotunnel group via its subsidiary myferrylink sas purchases capacity from the scop and sells the crossings under the
     myferrylink brand these contractual relationships are described in chapter 22 of this registration document

     the status of these activities as regards the french and british competition authorities is presented in section 208 of this registration
     document

     the berlioz and rodin ferries can carry from 1200 to 1900 passengers and 120 trucks or 700 cars the freight ferry nord
     pasdecalais can transport up to 85 trucks with the scop that are operating them the three vessels in service make up to
     24 crossings a day

     in 2014 this activity generated revenue of c93 million for the group compared with c74 million in 2013

a uk rail freight market
rail freight is growing and is set to take an even larger share of the uks freight market in future the uk rail freight market is valued at
circa 900 million with gb railfreight having a current market share of approximately 17 in the following sectors
 bulk coal construction petrochemicals steel and waste
 intermodal international and domestic
 automotive
 infrastructure network raillondon undergroundrail services

the volume of freight moved by rail between 199394 and 201314 has increased by around 65 to 23000 million tonnekms rails
share of overland freight movement is 13 up from 8 in 1993 approximately 35 of the coal consumed by uk power stations is
transported by rail around 30 of rail freight is intermodal container traffic this number is forecast to grow subject to government
grant support

in the united kingdom the sensitivity and behaviour of customers in response to environmental issues is already influencing purchasing
criteria and has led companies to pursue or prove their commitment in this field thus for example two large british supermarket
chains tesco and sainsburys are making increasing use of rail freight in their supply chains to reduce their carbon footprint

the environmental advantages of rail freight are clear 26 of the uks co2 emissions come from transport 90 of this being road
transport1 while rail freight produces three to four times less co2 per tonne transported than road transport and up to ten times fewer
polluting emissions2

the uks three main political parties are in favour of freight distribution by rail recognising its role as a green alternative to road transport
this support is obvious when we consider the following points
 promotion of the growth of rail freight  2007 white paper on rail transport3 which included the launch of the strategic rail freight
   network and supported a doubling in rail freight volumes
 promotion of the efficiency and capacity of the railway network as specified in the publication from the department for transport in
   september 2009 entitled strategic freight network the longerterm vision4 and
 the strategic funding of the freight programme through the transport initiatives fund the department for transport has contributed
   funding to network rail specifically for investments focused on rail freight

6 description of the eurotunnel groups activities

     the main sectors of gbrfs activity are summarised below


     bulk transport
     bulk transport services represented 49 of gbrfs revenue in 2014 the transport of coal between ports and power stations represents
     half of this activity and is complemented by a service transporting biomass


     intermodal transport
     the transport of containers is the second largest sector of activity for gbrf 21 of revenue after bulk transport this sector is largely
     concentrated on services out of the port of felixstowe the uks major container port gbrf is the main rail operator from the port

     this sector is particularly susceptible to the economic environment since it is linked to the level of imports and exports to and from the
     united kingdom the planned extension to the port of felixstowe represents an opportunity to develop gbrfs container services


     infrastructure services
     infrastructure maintenance activities whereby the company transports equipment to and evacuates waste material from infrastructure
     construction sites represented 25 of revenue in 2014

     gbrfs longterm strategy is based on differentiating itself from its competitors in terms of quality of service and safety management and
     has three main strands
      organic growth the companys strategy is to continue developing its business in the infrastructure modernisation and bulk transport
        sectors by building on existing contractual agreements and winning new business in particular gbrf is looking to expand its
        business of transporting biomass and to benefit from the development of this product as an alternative to coal in the uk power
        generation sector
      rolling stock gbrf continues to invest in new material and in 2014 acquired 21 new class 66 locomotives in order to support its
        growth and maintain service quality at the end of 2014 11 of these class 66 locomotives had been refinanced
      gbrf seeks to offer optimal working conditions to its employees thereby ensuring that it retains the expertise needed to maintain the
        high level of service quality expected by its customers

     furthermore in conjunction with europorte france gbrf continues to promote crosschannel rail freight traffic

     641 euro carex

     the eurotunnel group is involved in the euro carex project via its subsidiary london carex limited faced with ever stricter
     environmental constraints and rising fuel prices paris cdg amsterdam schipol lyon st exupery and liege airports linked up with
     logistics companies including fedex tnt and la poste to try to encourage a transfer of air freight onto the european highspeed railway
     network london carex is part of this umbrella organisation the euro carex association tasked with developing the british end of the
     network the carex concept is similar to a cargo aircraft running on rail highspeed trains that have been modified to carry air freight
     containers a fullscale trial was carried out in march 2012 with a carex tgv carrying parcels from lyon stexupery to london
     st pancras with a stop at roissycdg the trial proved the concept to the satisfaction of all carex partners in 2013 london carex
     continued its studies into setting up a branched terminal on hs1 and under the aegis of euro carex coordinated the drafting of

9 review of financial results

     927 pretax profit

     at c272 million in 2014 net finance costs decreased by c5 million compared to 2013 as a consequence of the decrease in inflation rates
     and the resulting effect on the nominal value of the indexlinked tranche of the debt

     net other financial income and charges in 2014 included net exchange losses of c12 million compared to a net loss of c1 million in
     2013 principally arising from unrealised exchange differences generated by the impact of the appreciation of sterling against the euro on
     the revaluation of intragroup balances in sterling held by french subsidiaries these intragroup balances arise primarily from funding
     flows between the concessionaires and get se where a deterioration of latent exchange losses would arise from an increase in sterling
     this line also includes interest receivable on the floating rate notes of c7 million 2013 c7 million

     the eurotunnel groups consolidated result before tax for the 2014 financial year was a profit of c56 million an increase of c26 million
     compared to 2013 at a constant exchange rate


     928 net result

     in 2014 income tax expense included a charge of c2 million relating to tax on dividends 3 of the c81 million dividend paid in 2014 an
     income tax charge of c2 million and a net deferred tax credit of c5 million

     the consolidated result after tax for the eurotunnel group for the 2014 financial year was a profit of c57 million at 31 december 2013
     the group accounted for the initial recognition of deferred tax in its consolidated accounts which gave rise to a credit for a net deferred
     tax asset of c83 million

106 debt service cover ratios

pursuant to the terms of the term loan the eurotunnel group is required to meet the following financial covenants
 at each halfyear closure the debt service cover ratio may not be less than 110 for the purposes of this test the ratio is calculated
   on a rolling 12 month period on a consolidated basis taking into account i as regards the calculation of available cash flow for the
   servicing of debt the borrowers and guarantors in connection with the senior facilities and ii as regards the calculation of debt
   servicing the eurotunnel group failure to meet this financial covenant amounts to one of the events of default and accelerated
   payment as described in note u of the consolidated financial statements contained in paragraph 2031 of this registration
   document
 at each sixmonthly test date after 31 december 2007 the ratio of operating cash flow to the total synthetic debt service on the term
   loan may not be less than 125 for the purposes of this test the ratio is calculated taking into account the hypothetical amortisation
   on the term loan and on the basis of a rolling 12 month period prior to the date of the test failure to meet this ratio on a sixmonthly
   testing date would lead to restrictions on the use of the groups excess available cash flow on the date of the next interest payment
   on the term loan until such time as the test is met once again these restrictions include in particular the ability of the eurotunnel
   group to pay dividends and to finance new activities failure to meet this test on three consecutive six monthly testing dates would
   trigger a prepayment event under which the groups excess available cash flow would have to be used towards prepayment of the
   term loan until the testing date on which the ratio is met once again

the debt service cover ratio and the synthetic service cover ratio for groupe eurotunnel se at 31 december 2014 were 176 and 158
respectively and thus the financial covenants for the period were respected

     the eurotunnel group has been pursuing a development strategy based on longterm value creation for several years now this
     strategy built into various competitiveness improvement plans is based on the major strengths of the group
      a unique expertise as concessionaire of the fixed link a factor that offers great credibility in front of partners
      an continuously improving service offer
      an economic model based on solid foundations

     the economic recovery in the united kingdom accelerates the growth of the trading of goods across the channel in 2014 the short
     straits market regained its 2008 precrisis levels this refound momentum opens up prospects for shuttle services

     this momentum shall also be sustained in the medium term through investments that aim to increase the number of truck shuttles and
     the availability of rolling stock and to improve traffic flows

     the group has the means through the terminal 2015 project an investment of c30 million and the order of three new truck shuttles
     c40 million to cope with the expected growth in truck traffic the projects for the expansion of the coquelles and folkestone terminals
     are progressing in line with the allocated budgets and with the schedule for an opening expected in 2015

     beyond the short or medium term the group is preparing for its future and as part of a collaborative longterm approach the vision
     2020 project is organising the fixed links teams in preparation for 2020 the challenges ahead are grouped into seven themes on
     which seven working groups are working in order to bring innovative solutions to make this ambitious project a success within the
     context of this collaborative vision 2020 approach the group has set itself the objective of receiving by 2020
      2 million trucks compared with 14 million in 2014
      3 million cars compared with 25 million in 2014
      5000 rail freight trains compared with 2900 in 2014
      135 million highspeed train passengers compared with 104 million in 2014

     the eurotunnel group shall focus on strengthening its growth drivers in 2015 while at the same time reaffirming the priorities of safety
     and service quality the leading private rail freight operator in france and the uk the europorte segment operates across the entire rail
     transport logistics chain five years after it was established the subsidiary of groupe eurotunnel se relies on the quality of its service its
     reliability and its punctuality to develop its business at a steady pace following the decision of the competition appeal tribunal on
     9 january 2015 confirming the decision that prohibited eurotunnel from operating a ferry service out of dover the group has decided to
     put its maritime business up for sale

     since the group does not limit its view of success to economic performance through the introduction of its csr policy taken to the
     highest levels of the business and the introduction of a composite index the eurotunnel group is committed to the environmental social
     and societal dimension of its activity the eurotunnel groups objective is overall value creation the performance of its operations is not
     limited to the technical field but can also be seen in terms of security upholding ethical principles dialogue with stakeholders
     environmental added value social integration and contribution to local development

     the anticipated evolution of the groups business together with the implementation of its investment policy enables the group to set
     the financial objective of an ebitda of c535 million for 2015 and c580 million for 2016 based on an exchange rate of 1c13 and
     excluding myferrylink

     this objective is based on data assumptions and estimations deemed reasonable they are nevertheless susceptible to change or
     modification due to uncertainty linked particularly to the economic financial competitive and regulatory environment in addition the
     occurrence of certain risks described in chapter 4 risk factors of this registration document would have an impact on the groups
     activities and its ability to achieve its objectives furthermore achieving the objectives implies the successful implementation of the
     strategy presented in chapter 6 description of the eurotunnel groups activities of this reference document the eurotunnel group
     does not therefore make any commitments nor does it give any guarantee that the objectives will be met and the forwardlooking
     information contained in this chapter cannot be used to make profit forecasts

     151 remuneration policy for executive officers

     the remuneration policy for the chairman and chief executive officer and the deputy chief executive officer is decided by the board of
     directors based on the work and recommendations of the nomination and remuneration committee

     following the recommendation of the nomination and remuneration committee the board of directors wanted the remuneration policy
     for the chairman and chief executive officer as well as the deputy chief executive officer and other executive officers to be simple to
     offer continuity over time and to be consistent with the groups remuneration policy including for the management the remuneration for
     executive officers is linked to mid and long term growth to the intrinsic value of the company and to the share performance it is set in line
     with the average remuneration per employee the dividend and the results

     the board of directors decided that the remuneration policy should encourage longterm performance in all key areas of the business
     whether they be strategic workforcerelated social or environmental and not only financial issues in line with the european
     recommendation of 30 april 2009 the performance criteria for the executive officers variable remuneration have been designed to
     encourage longterm performance

     following a proposal of the nomination and remuneration committee the board of directors ensures that the remuneration of the
     executive officers is consistent with the longterm interests of the company and its shareholders and that the different components of
     the remuneration of the executive officers fixed and variable remuneration possible granting of additional retirement benefits and share
     options are commensurate and in keeping with the principles set out in the afepmedef code

     in particular the board of directors strives to adhere to the following guidelines
      completeness all the elements that make up the remuneration of executive officers are reviewed each year the fixed and variable
         elements and share options or preference shares benefits in kind attendance fees and retirement conditions
      intelligibility of the rules and balance the rules are simple stable transparent and where possible enduring each element of the
         remuneration is clearly substantiated and is in keeping with the general interest of the business the variable part intended to reflect
         the actual contribution of the executive officers to the success of the group changes according to criteria representing the results of
         the group as well as the operational targets set for the year
         at the start of each financial year the board of directors on the recommendation of the nomination and remuneration committee
         defines each of the targets set for the executive officers for the year in question and determines what proportion of the overall variable
         part each of them may obtain after the close of the financial year the nomination and remuneration committee evaluates the
         achievement of said targets and based on that assessment the board of directors decides the variable part to be awarded to each
         executive officer the variable remuneration awarded for a given financial year is therefore paid in the following year
          the part based on the achievement of targets linked to the groups intrinsic annual performance is based on financial indicators
             determined according to group objectives
          the part based on the achievement of operational targets is based on criteria set taking into account the capacity to achieve
             certain strategic objectives
          the share options include internal performance criteria ebitda target and payment of dividends andor as the case might be
             external performance criteria to ensure their financial alignment with the longterm interests of the shareholders
      measurement remuneration is determined taking into account the general interests of the business market practices and the
         performance of the executive officers therefore in line with the groups remuneration policy the fixed part of the chairman and
         chief executive officers remuneration was not revised in 2014 in addition given that the overall performance of the business
         depends on good management of relations with all the stakeholders the labour relations performance criterion included in the
         calculation of the chairman and chief executive officers remuneration two years ago was strengthened not in percentage terms
         but through the introduction of a composite csr index in the business
      consistency and benchmarking in its recommendations to the board of directors the nomination and remuneration committee
         ensures that the remuneration policy proposed is adapted to each individuals responsibilities and consistent with the remuneration
         policy for the employees of the group and in line with comparable groups in order to compare the consistency of the remuneration
         of the chairman and chief executive officer with market practice the committee carried out its own analyses and to appraise the
         results also commissioned a specialised consultancy mercer to undertake a study of the positioning of the chairman and chief
         executive officers remuneration in relation to remuneration paid by other similar groups of companies

     the remuneration sums shown in this chapter 15 cover all remuneration due or allocated to the executive officers for all of their terms or
     functions within the group

financial criteria with each representing 25
 net result for the year compared to the net result stated in the budget 25
 published target for ebitda in 2014 25 in 2014 this second financial criterion replaced the budgeted operating cash flow making
    the target more visible for the sake of consistency and transparency

the board of directors also defined the following three operational criteria
 consolidation of longterm growth prospects for the group 30
 innovation capacity for technological innovation 10
   the achievement of this objective was appraised using different indices such as the renewal in 2014 of club car carriages
   television etc the use of new technologies to optimise operational and business processes and launching the gsmp in the
   north service tunnel in 2014 public telephony
 improvement in business performance while complying with social and environmental responsibility 10

rate of staff turnover which for 2014 must not exceed 5 and the rate of vocational training calculated based on the ratio below

                                                 number of training hours provided
                                                                                        1

     the committee examined the quantitative criteria financial and operational and quantified the degree to which they had been met the
     committee found that the ebitda target had been exceeded but had not reached the 110 band and therefore remained limited to
     25 while the net result criterion reached the 120 band the committee found that the target of consolidation of longterm growth
     prospects for the group and the technical innovation criteria had been achieved the committee also considered the criterion of quality
     of social dialogue to enhance performance the committee undertook a qualitative evaluation which was nonetheless guided by three
     quantified indicators of the quality of social dialogue the committee found that with a staff turnover rate of 52 compared with the
     target of 5 the quality of social dialogue objective had only been twothirds achieved

     encourage the overperformance of the chairman and chief executive officer and to that purpose after having considered the relative
     competitiveness of the remuneration granted to the chairman and chief executive officer decided while maintaining a target bonus of
     100 of the basic annual salary should the targets be met to increase the maximum to 120 of the annual basic salary in the event of
     overperformance

     the board of directors decided to maintain two financial criteria including the net result criterion which has been applied since 2010 and
     the choice of published ebitda as a target for the chairman and chief executive officers remuneration to ensure consistency and
     transparency of the disclosure as in previous years the board of directors decided to retain a proportion of 50 to be based on
     operational criteria in order to have performance criteria that cover all key business issues

     would be tightened stable relevant and balanced the group instructed an external advisor to carry out a benchmark of the best
     practices of companies within the cac 40 index and commissioned a qualitative survey with both its internal and external stakeholders
     this approach identified four themes that are directly related to the groups business healthsafety social climate greenhouse gas
     emissions and client satisfaction indicators and targets have been determined for each of these items so as to calculate the level of
     achievement of the composite index in accordance with the criteria set out for each item

16 board and management practices

     peter levene colette lewiner robert rochefort philippe vasseur tim yeo and since 31 may 2014 jeanpierre trotignon whose term
     of office as deputy chief executive officer of eurotunnel group ended over five years ago on 31 may 2009

     jacques gounon chairman and chief executive officer and philippe camu a representative of gs global infrastructure partners the
     companys main shareholder are not considered to be independent board members

     to consider the extent to which a business relationship is or is not significant the board of directors referred to a table summarising fund
     flows purchases and sales occurring during the financial year elapsed between
      group companies on one hand and
      group companies of which independent board members of the company are also a board member

     these flows are considered in relation to the total weight of purchases and sales for each group to measure their significance for
     2014 this table reveals that the sum of sales of the companys group to any one of the groups concerned or of its purchases from any
     one of those groups does not exceed 07 of the total sales or purchases of the companys group or of any one of the groups
     concerned with the exception of two suppliers for which tendering rules and procedures protect equality of treatment of the suppliers
     and accordingly the independence of the directors

     therefore as at 17 march 2015 there are nine independent board members out of a total of eleven representing 82 of the board
     members in office more than half of the board members are independent in accordance with the provisions of the afepmedef code

      efficient use of its resources and should enable it to appropriately factor in all significant risks be they operational financial or
      compliancerelated

      specifically the system seeks to ensure
       compliance with the laws and regulations in force
       the implementation of instructions decided by the general management
       the proper functioning of the companys internal processes particularly those related to safeguarding its tangible and intangible
         assets
       the reliability of financial information

      internal control is not restricted to a set of procedures or mere accounting and financial processes and it does not encompass all the
      initiatives undertaken by corporate or management bodies moreover it cannot provide an absolute guarantee that the companys
      objectives will be achieved

      the internal control and risk management system extends throughout the group and its consolidated french and british subsidiaries

      as part of its continuous improvement approach in 2014 the group implemented the following actions to reinforce the internal control
      and risk management system
       the body of procedures was updated and enhanced
       the internal control team was strengthened
       the register of group risks based on a reference framework common to all subsidiaries and the individual registers for each
         subsidiary set up in 2013 were updated at the 2014 annual review


      1692 comprehensive risk management and internal control process

      a risk management procedures
      the objective of the groups risk management process is to enable general management and the board of directors to
       have a complete consistent and structured view of all types of major risks to which the company is exposed and of their
         evolution and
       appreciate the appropriateness of the mitigating measures implemented by those responsible for managing each of the risks in the
         light of their potential impact on the companys strategic objectives

      risk management contributes to creating and preserving the companys value assets and reputation it provides greater security in the
      companys decision making and in its processes which promotes the achievement of its objectives it fosters consistency between the
      companys actions and its values and seeks to mobilise the companys employees around a common vision of the main risks and
      promote awareness among them of the risks inherent to their work


      i   identification and analysis of risks
      this first stage allows the key risks threatening the achievement of the companys objectives to be identified and consolidated a risk can
      be either a threat or a missed opportunity it is characterised by an event which has one or more sources and one or more
      consequences this identification will be followed by an analysis which involves examining the potential consequences of the key risks
      consequences that may be financial human legal or related to reputation and estimating the likelihood that they may come to pass
      this dual approach is a continuous process


      ii risk management
      the risk management system is monitored and regularly reviewed with a view to its ongoing improvement the aim is to identify and
      assess key potential risks and draw lessons from incidents

      the process includes a formal annual review presented to the audit committee and subsequently to the board of directors of get se
      at the end of the financial year under consideration the risk reviews are based on the strategic plan applicable at the date of the relevant
      review

      risk reviews are coordinated by the companys corporate risk manager these reviews seek to identify and quantify the risks facing the
      company and to identify and assess the mitigating measures put in place to manage them they make it possible to implement a
      risk map

                                                                     board and management practices                                           
                                                                                                                                              16

the process which consists primarily of formal interviews with directors and senior management across the company comprises two
parallel approaches
 a topdown approach consisting of the identification of the risks linked to strategic initiatives both from the point of view of their
   direct effect on the companys business and the knockon effect that they may generate on preexisting risks and changes in the
   companys economic environment and
 the traditional bottomup approach which seeks to identify risks in each of the main business areas commercial
   technicaloperational financial staff safety and security environment and corporate governance

the identification of new risks is based on the systematic review of external sources of information global conditions benchmarking
trade bodies etc and internal information developments within the company interviews and lobbying of the management team

the risk register contains the following information
 description of the risk
 residual risk assessment following consideration of mitigation measures based on criteria of probability of occurrence and impact
 identification of the risk manager and the degree to which that manager considers the risk is managed as at the date of the review
   with a view to improving this

the risks are arranged in order according to the degree to which they are critical all group risks are grouped in categories and
subcategories which are common to all subsidiaries to enable an appropriate and homogeneous point of comparison between them
in addition a group register has been compiled to enable monitoring at a more global level thus the risks of each group subsidiary and
the risks monitored at a corporate level are mapped in this manner this approach initiated in 2013 was completed with the 2014
annual review

this approach of identifying and analysing significant risks and processes strengthens the groups knowledge of risk by formalising and
consolidating work already done in this area


iii treatment and monitoring of risks
each risk has a level of control that corresponds to the systems of selection and implementation of the measures aimed at altering it the
company may envisage a number of measures reduction transfer deletion or acceptance of a risk the choice of how to manage a risk
will involve in particular weighing opportunities against the costs of risk management measures while also taking account of their
possible effects on the likelihood andor consequences of the risk occurring the controls to be put in place fall under the scope of the
internal control system in this way the internal control system contributes to the management of risks incurred in the companys
activities

the corporate risk manager and internal audit monitor major risks and new or emerging risks on an ongoing basis and any significant
changes are reported to the executive committee and to the audit committee


b components of internal control

      1725 training

      the eurotunnel group which operates in an environment requiring high levels of technical skill has always made training one of its key
      priorities as indicated in chapter 4 of this registration document

      the main focus of the groups training policy is to strengthen the key skills of its employees and to maintain a high level of operational
      performance within teams enabling them to contribute to the development of the business its main priorities are to emphasise a shared
      safety and environment culture and to improve the assistance given to employees to help them adapt to their job

      the eurotunnel group has set up the centre international de formation ferroviaire de la cote dopale ciffco a facility that ensures
      the management of the training plan and provides training for the concession and supports the development of the rail freight industry
      and local train operators it provides dedicated training programmes with a focus on railrelated activities in the national railways and
      other networks in 2014 ciffco delivered 7235 railway training days compared with 3077 days in 2013 to meet the training
      requirements of the group and the needs of external entities

      on 8 september 2014 ciffcos approval as a training centre was renewed by renewing this frances public rail safety body epsf
      acknowledged the quality of the work carried out by the teams involved and the ciffcos solid commitment issued for a period of five
      years the certification confirms the ciffcos compliance with epsf requirements for all safety functions such as train driver assistant
      infrastructure maintenance or rolling stock

      train driver training given by ciffco was also entered in the official records of professional french certifications rncp which will allow
      official professional qualifications to be issued thus ciffco is now the first and only private training body able to issue this certification
      along with the french public operator registration of the professional certification recognises the functions of train drivers and their
      qualifications

      in 2014 more than 220000 hours were devoted to the professional training of the workforce the equivalent of just over 55 training
      hours per employee on average versus 36 hours in 2013 an increase of around 65 compared with last year this increase was spread
      across in varying degrees all subsidiaries of the group where training activity supported the growth in staff and business the
      subsidiaries of gbrf and europorte france for example more than doubled the number of hours dedicated to training in 2014 an

1726 diversity and equal opportunities

a gender equality
professional equality between men and women is an important lever in the groups diversity policy respect for the principles of gender
equality is reflected in the application of an equal opportunities policy in recruitment access to training remuneration and promotion
within this framework an agreement on professional equality to eliminate the gender pay gap was reached by esgie with unions in
june 2009 and will remain in force indefinitely this was reinforced by the signing on 10 july 2013 of a 12month action plan pursuing
human resources policies that aim to guarantee nondiscrimination and gender equality

in the united kingdom there is a particular focus on wage equality the rate for the job system ensures equitable remuneration as
does the hays system which measures in particular the importance and the difficulty of assigned responsibility for esl salaried staff

the human resources policies of every group entity are based on the inviolable principle of gender equality and the charter of ethics and
behaviour addressed to all group employees describes the principles that must inspire the behaviour of every employee in relation to
respect for people of which the principle of nondiscrimination is one of the most important

at 31 december 2014 the number of women employed by the group was 808 there were 171 women in management positions
representing 213 of management staff


b employment and integration of disabled employees
disability is another important aspect of the groups diversity policy which supports the integration professional training and continued
employment of disabled people the group formalised its disabled policy in france by signing a threeyear agreement in 2010 with the
unions for 20112013 to promote the employment of people with disabilities for esgie this agreement establishes the groups policy
regarding the professional integration of disabled people in france the schedule for negotiations to renew this agreement was pushed
back to 2015

at the same time as promoting the continued employment of disabled people the group works with groups providing support to the
disabled by approaching employment agencies for the disabled andor job centres an agreement still current was drawn up in 2010
for the benefit of disabled workers with afapei association frontaliere des parents et amis de lenfance inadaptee on behalf of esgie
an agreement was also drawn up between cap energie and esgie for two contracts valid up to 31 may 2015 one contract
concerns the upkeep of green spaces at the coquelles site 15034 hours were spent at the site in 2014 and the other focuses on the
cleaning of network buses and service vehicles 1500 hours at the site in 2014 on 23 july 2013 a framework partnership agreement
was signed between the eurotunnel group and the french association for disabled people association des paralyses de france apf
in which the group undertook to approach apf for any services falling within its sphere of competence pursuant to this partnership in
accordance with the commitments undertaken by the group esgie has issued frequent service requests to the apf and this led to an
exponential increase in the value of these services in 2014 almost five times over with respect to 2013 c23600 vs c111500

the rate of employment of disabled workers in 2014 for esgie europorte france and socorail calculated on the basis of data provided
in the annual compulsory employment declaration sent to agefiph the french national association which manages funds for the
professional integration of people with disabilities was 436 042 and 094 respectively 2013 410 027 and 092

it is not possible to collect data for this indicator from the groups british entities as there is no specific disabled worker status in the
united kingdom however they  like all other group entities  are bound by the commitments and fundamental principles of the
groups charter of ethics and behaviour and have an equal opportunities policy intended to ensure that all employees are treated
identically

      which it unreservedly endorses bearing in mind that the company is based in europe where social laws have prohibited all forms of
      forced and compulsory labour and to combat child labour since the beginning of the 20th century

b education
as a group committed to its environment and beyond that society eurotunnel supports education and culture as it understands that
sharing knowledge is a key factor in boosting equal opportunities its actions in this field mainly revolve around raising awareness of
sustainable development railwayrelated training and economic and cultural exchanges between france and the united kingdom

 raising awareness of csr among young people
in its efforts to protect the environment the eurotunnel group not only strives to limit the impact of its activities on the environment but
has also resolutely applied itself to shaping it for the better samphire hoe provides a good example of what the group is capable of a
35hectare site at the foot of the dover cliffs samphire hoe was created using 5 million cubic metres of blue chalk and marl extracted
from the channel subsoil as the tunnel was dug this piece of land on the coast has gradually been turned into a nature reserve
daytoday management of this protected site is the responsibility of the white cliffs countryside partnership supported by many
volunteers from in and around kent

samphire hoe welcomed more than 100000 visitors in 2014 on 28 november 2014 the eurotunnel group and its partners opened a
new visitor centre in samphire hoe to provide groups from schools with a fullyequipped educational space all year round

eight mobile driving simulators in 2014 it provided a total of 7235 training days to 861 people from all over france as well as from
belgium switzerland italy and the united kingdom

furthermore in terms of its impact on the region it should be noted that ciffcos activities in 2014 generated 7000 overnight stays in
hotels and accommodation facilities located in the calais region compared with 1485 in 2013 which represents almost a fivefold
increase

the eurotunnel group is a founding member of the fer de france association which was created in 2012 and brings together the leading
players in the french railway industry work conducted by this association led to proposals for the french state to recognise different
professions in this developing sector

in this field europorte has been responsible for two major initiatives
 implementation and development of a qualifying training programme in disciplines relating to railway engineering and maintenance
    in close collaboration with the french national conservatory of arts and crafts cnam
 partnership with e2c grand lille the greater lille second chance school for the social and professional insertion of young people

      174 environmental information

      1741 general environmental policy

      as part of its commitment to lowcarbon transport the group pursues an ambitious strategy combining development of its core activity
      crosschannel transport with external growth in its two main businesses and areas of expertise other than the fixed link infrastructure
      management and rail transport

      in line with this strategy the eurotunnel group and the europorte subsidiaries are developing a broadbased offering of rail freight
      transport and associated logistics services throughout france and the united kingdom the group is committed to leading the way in
      environmentallyresponsible transport and makes its expertise and leadership available to its subsidiaries and customers to help them
      reduce the carbon footprint of their activities

      regarding the costs undertaken to prevent the environmental impact of the companys activities these were incurred during the tunnels
      construction and basically consist of separate networks for collecting rain and waste water retention ponds treatment plants etc as
      indicated in section 171 of this registration document there is no separate budget for the groups csr policy

      the group has made no provisions against environmental risks nor did it pay out any courtordered compensation for environmental
      damage the obligation to put in place a financial guarantee as defined in article l 5161 of the french environmental code against
      any environmental damage does not apply to the groups activities

      the tunnel and its rail transport system provide certain intrinsic environmental advantages
       an underground link that does not interfere in any way with the marine environment and
       the use of electric power for haulage produces minimal atmospheric pollution and much lower greenhouse gas emissions than
         fossil fuels

      as early as 2002 the concessionaires installed an environmental management system based on the requirements of the iso 14001
      standard and trained environmental officers and internal auditors an environmental requirements clause has also been introduced
      into agreements with its subcontractors

      every year targeted audits are carried out in france and the united kingdom by the safety and sustainable development directorate in
      2014 ten internal audits were carried out six in the operational divisions and four in relation to subcontractors besides complying with
      legal and regulatory requirements a regulatory review is carried out each month as part of its continued commitment to the
      environment esgie set up a safety and sustainable development directorate in 2006 safety is absolutely essential for the eurotunnel
      group and combining it with a strong sustainable development policy shows how important these issues are for the company

      as part of their induction to the company every new employee learns about the companys environmental policy targets and the
      organisation put in place to minimise the environmental impacts of its activity

      in france europortes core activity rail freight is a perfect fit with the chief policy aim of frances environmental round table programme
      grenelle environnement which seeks to develop more efficient and less carbonintensive freight transport europorte provides support
      and assesses the needs of its customers with the aim wherever possible and economically viable of switching freight from road to rail

      europorte works in four main areas to contribute to the national commitment to rail freight
       to help develop intermodal transport and so move more containers by train
       to act as a local train operator serving the regions and areas around ports with light and appropriate organisations and improving rail
         services to the major french ports major entry points for highvolume freight
       to contribute to group thinking on developing highspeed rail freight between airports
       to contribute via a pathquality agreement with sncf reseau to more efficient management of train paths

      prompted by the group europorte has embarked on its own environmental strategy alongside the implementation of transparent
      reporting on abstraction from and discharge into the environment an environmental impact assessment of the activities of europortes
      french entities was completed in 2013 resulting in various measures being taken to mitigate this impact
       optimisation of energy consumption to reduce contributions to the greenhouse effect
       creation of appropriate mechanisms for sortingcollecting and treating the various types of waste produced
       selection of environmentally friendly products
       creation of green areas for parking and engine maintenance

   improved management of hazardous situations in conjunction with its customers
   raising awareness about ecocitizen practices among staff

in addition to these general policy initiatives specific objectives were set
 socorail to take environmental criteria into account when planning maintenance programmes for its shunting engines oil leaks and
    particulate emissions from engines a fiveyear investment plan was drawn up which includes the complete renovation of two to
    three shunting engines per year on average and the overhaul of components on a casebycase basis at the end of 2014 40 of
    the socorail site was equipped with newgeneration engines
 europorte france an ecodriving approach involving both raising the awareness of drivers of main line trains regarding the impact of
    their driving behaviour on energy consumption and the installation of technical equipment allowing a reduction in consumption by
    locomotives as well as driver assistance systems depending on the characteristics of the network and the train making it easier to
    drive in a more ecofriendly fashion
 in 2014 europorte and its longstanding partner malteurope frall set up a reflection cell for good csr practices a working group
    that sets out to streamline csr action at each company and create synergies wherever possible

since 2011 europortes central safety quality and environment department and more specifically the qualityenvironment service has
been responsible for rolling out and implementing this policy at french subsidiaries initiatives are taken up in each region by the regional
head of quality and safety

the sqas rail safety and quality assessment system was carried out in 2014 across all europortes french subsidiaries europorte is
thus involved in a process of continuous improvement verified every 3 years by sqas the assessment established an overall score of
86 and will be conducted in addition to mase and iso 9001 certification as indicated in paragraph 426 of this registration
document

within the framework of the regulatory developments ensuing from frances environmental round table programme socorail has been
ecophyto certified since 2013 for weed control activities conducted on the rail networks of certain ports and industrial sites the system
put in place is intended to limit the use of phytosanitary products and better control their impact

in the united kingdom environmental risk management is at the heart of gbrfs operations every new traffic flow or change to existing
traffic flows is subject to a risk assessment including environmental risks this environmental risk management system has enabled
gbrf to gain iso 140012004 accreditation without interruption since 2006 the company is audited every six months by the british
standards institute which ensures gbrf properly adheres to its environmental risk management system

gbrfs safety management department is responsible for the successful implementation of the annual environmental action plan a
number of initiatives such as tests on the use of fuel additives fuel management systems on board locomotives replacement of
locomotive injection systems and economic driving techniques have now been carried out the most recent initiative is new technology
using gps to help drivers optimise traction power

the general policy of europorte subsidiaries on both sides of the channel lays down environmental considerations that require
europorte to be involved in controlling its environmental impacts particularly in energy consumption progress on the resulting
environmental action plans is monitored monthly by the europorte safety committee chaired by the europorte chairman on the french
side and by gbrfs executive safety committee on the british side


1742 risk prevention pollution and waste management

the group has a waste collection and treatment strategy that prioritises recovery or reuse most waste products come from industrial
activities and vary in type and quantity from year to year depending on the projects being run at the time

the quantity of hazardous industrial waste produced in france and the uk fell significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year
by 21 and 34 respectively this reduction mainly in relation to europorte in france was mainly due to a major fall in product waste



                                                                              2014 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se

17 corporate social responsibility

      from the gray maintenance facility the fall in the uk was due to the absence of any exceptional operations in 2014 at the fixed links
      british terminal as was the case in 2013 when 135000 litres of polluted water were used during maintenance at the facilities the slight
      increase in the treatment of nonhazardous waste around 17 at group level was essentially due to europortes destocking at le
      havre and la rochelle of waste that had been stored there for several years and to new projects carried out at the concessions
      uk terminal

      the eurotunnel group takes steps to address air quality and the emissions impact of its activities notably the diesel locomotives that
      pull concession works trains have been fitted with catalytic converters since 2007 elsewhere measures were taken to bring the outflow
      chimneys used in the ventilation system for paint workshops into compliance with volatile organic compound emission standards

      the noise of commercial activities and maintenance is also closely monitored around installations a 2009 study showed that the
      activities of the fixed link breached no noise standards either at the edge of the property or in regulated surrounding areas during the
      day or at night measurements were taken in compliance with i the technical annex to the ministerial order dated 23 january 1997 on
      limiting environmental noise by installations classified for environmental protection icpe without derogating from any of its provisions
      and ii standard nf s 31010 of december 1996 on the characterisation and measurement of environmental noise  specific
      measurement methods

      pursuant to french law no 76663 of 19 july 1976 relating to installations classified for the protection of the environment both terminals
      in coquelles and sangatte are designated icpe sites due to the potential dangers and risks that its activities may pose to the
      surrounding area and to health safety nature and the environment such as refrigeration airconditioning storage and use of
      flammable liquids workshops and paints these activities are set out in a list which on the basis of the severity of the dangers or risks
      that they may represent requires eurotunnel group to either make a declaration to or request authorisation from the prefecture of the
      pasdecalais in respect of them these activities are monitored by the regional authority for the environment planning and housing
      dreal

      similarly pursuant to french law no 923 of 3 january 1992 on water the concessionaire france manche must request the
      authorisation of the relevant administrative authority for any proposed construction works or activities to be carried out outside of the
      icpe area which may pose a danger to public health and safety endanger the free flow of water reduce the availability of water
      substantially increase the risk of floods or seriously damage the quality or diversity of the marine environment

      regarding air quality in france europorte has been using very low sulphur diesel in its main line locomotives and shunting engines since
      2011 almost all the waste produced comes from the maintenance of rolling stock and rail infrastructure at industrial sites waste
      management procedures are generally the responsibility of the customer europorte only applies its own waste management
      procedures to its port rail infrastructure services at dunkirk nantesst nazaire and le havrerouen and europorte proximites
      locomotive maintenance workshop at arclesgray in both these activities waste is sorted internally and then sent to a third party for
      treatment in the same way regarding gbrf most waste is generated by the maintenance of rolling stock which is done by
      subcontractors gbrf monitors subcontractor waste tracking forms measures to prevent soil pollution were strengthened at the
      europorte proximite workshop by the introduction of a system for the drywashing of locomotives

      regarding noise one major source is wheel flats on wagons europorte does not own wagons and its technical management therefore
      takes a threepronged approach to this issue i systematically refusing wagons with wheel flats of more than 60 mm ii supporting
      customers and wagonowners generally in anticipating and remedying these problems and iii taking part in working groups on
      improving the quality of the wagon fleets

      europorte has equipped all its equipment with noise dampers which have cut noise pollution from escaping compressed air during
      brake tests prior to running by about half

group consumption sourced from groundwater fell by 18 compared to 2013 a year during which major cleaning works were carried
out at the fixed link which were not renewed in 2014 although water is a plentiful resource in the pasdecalais area the eurotunnel
group has nevertheless tracked water consumption by the fixed link since it came into service generally the consumption of water
sourced from the public network increased by 4 this year against the previous year mainly due to cleaning operations at the french
terminal

the concessionaires have large land banks in france and the united kingdom and have since the tunnels construction created
several dozen hectares of nature reserves for the conservation and promotion of biodiversity including samphire hoe described in
paragraph 1731 b of this registration document in france nature reserves are located within the concession perimeter and so are
not open to the public they are however visited by numerous species of migratory birds in winter and shelter many breeding pairs
during the nesting season

almost all water consumption at europorte subsidiaries is used for sanitary purposes in the buildings and sites used by staff

europorte prioritises the use of electric locomotives wherever technical constraints and economic viability considerations allow

europorte is also continuing to study the solutions that locomotive builders may be offering over the next five years for developing hybrid
electricdiesel engines

     since no gbrf site is equipped with a counter the europorte france ratio for which the activities are close was applied this extrapolation method
      tends to accentuate the changes observed at the sites equipped with counters for example the reduction in water consumption observed at the gray
      workshop had an impact on the estimated water consumption of all the europorte and gbrf sites


1744 climate change

in 2011 the groups management of greenhouse gas emissions was audited by the independent organisation carbon trust standard
which set the baseline level of greenhouse gas emissions for the whole of the eurotunnel groups activities at 2010 levels future
progress will be measured against this baseline

the eurotunnel group is developing a policy for monitoring and managing the greenhouse gas emissions of its subsidiaries in
anticipation of the publication of the implementing regulations for article 228  ii of the grenelle 2 law regarding the information that must
be provided by any person providing or procuring the provision of transport services on the quantity of carbon dioxide emitted by the
modes of transport used to perform this service

17 corporate social responsibility

      the eurotunnel group is mindful of the greenhouse gas emissions generated by its activities with the help of specialists using the
      assessment method bilan carbone accredited by ademe a carbon footprint assessment was carried out in france and the
      united kingdom in 2006  2007 this assessment included emissions generated by electricity consumption used to haul shuttles
      eurostar trains and train operators rail freight services through the tunnel emissions generated by workshops diesel works trains
      and road vehicles used for staff transport deliveries and catering it also includes all emissions linked to the construction of infrastructure
      and the associated construction materials

      the carbon footprint assessment identified the fixed links primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions and was followed by an
      action plan focused on two factors that accounted for approximately 80 of the emissions the use of energy provided by electricity and
      fossil fuels and emissions from refrigeration fluids

      in addition to the steps taken by the group since 2011 as detailed above in 2009 the group was accredited by the carbon trust
      standard following an audit of the groups management of greenhouse gas emissions and its performance over the previous three
      years which confirmed a 44 reduction in emissions between 2006 and 2008 the eurotunnel groups data for 2013 and 2014 will be
      audited again by carbon trust our continuation of this process has greatly increased our efficiency and boosted our position in the
      transport sector as a benchmark in terms of controlling greenhouse gas emissions

      in 2014 europortes french subsidiaries undertook the tk blue label set up by the european tk blue agency the tk blue index
      appraises the technical economic environmental and social performances of its transport offer europorte applies the workrelated
      travel policy of the group which encourages the use of public and rail transport for workrelated travel by its staff

      in the united kingdom the concessionaires as managers of infrastructure of major importance to the british economy were asked by
      the british department for environment food and rural affairs defra in line with the 2008 climate change act to carry out a study of
      its infrastructures ability to withstand the foreseeable effects of climate change

      gbrf will undergo a full energy audit in 2015 as part of the energysaving opportunity scheme regulations esos 2014 to be
      conducted by independent experts the audit will pinpoint the companys main risks and opportunities in terms of reduction of energy
      consumption and environmental impact and furnish a benchmark to gauge the results of its programme for continuous improvement

      the eurotunnel group strives constantly to limit the impact of its activities on the environment this year it reduced its greenhouse gas
      emissions by 6 compared to the previous year ie more than 10000 tonnes of co2 equivalent

      the group has not been subjected to any fines of any type whatsoever nor has is it been subjected to any reports of noncompliance

      1745 protection of biodiversity

      in this field the eurotunnel group acts in accordance with the spirit and the text of the convention on biological diversity one of the main
      objectives of which is conserving biodiversity and sustainable use of its elements the samphire hoe site is from this perspective a
      concrete example of the will of the group to act to promote biodiversity and to protect the environment in 2014 the partnership
      between the concessionaires and the white cliffs countryside project wccp was given its tenth successive green flag award for its
      management of the samphire hoe site which has made an impressive contribution to local biodiversity

      dolls house hill the steep slope overlooking the folkestone terminal installations is also an exceptional haven for animal and plant life
      recognised throughout the specialised scientific world the concessionaires have undertaken to maintain and conserve this site  which
      forms part of a site of special scientific interest sssi like samphire hoe and the whole of the folkestone downs  again in partnership
      with the wccp

17 corporate social responsibility

      we deem that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have learned by exercising our professional judgment allow us to formulate a
      conclusion providing limited assurance a higher level of assurance would have required more extensive work because of the use of
      sampling techniques and because of other limits inherent to any information and internal control systems the risk of not detecting a
      material misstatement in the csr information cannot be completely eliminated


      conclusion
      based on our work we did not identify any material misstatements that would lead us to believe that the csr information taken as a
      whole has not been fairly presented in all material respects in accordance with the reporting criteria

      confirmed the decision of the competition and markets authority that the eurotunnel group must cease operating these ferries out of
      the port of dover within the next six months the decision of the competition and markets authority was based on the assumption that
      the eurotunnel group had acquired seafrances business an interpretation that the group has always contested

      the eurotunnel group decided not to appeal this decision and announced that it intends to seek a buyer for myferrylink and the three
      ferries due to the condition imposed by the tribunal de commerce at the time of their purchase in 2012 prohibiting the sale of the ferries

      costs directly attributable to business combinations are accounted for in the periods operating result


      ii interests in equityaccounted companies
      interests in equityaccounted companies include investments in entities in which the group has significant influence and jointly
      controlled entities these investments are initially recognised at cost of acquisition including any goodwill arising their carrying amount
      is then increased or decreased to recognise the groups share of the entitys profits or losses after the date of acquisition should the
      losses be greater than the value of the groups net investment in the equityaccounted entity these would only be recognised to the
      extent that the group has entered into a commitment to recapitalise the entity

      should there be an indication that an investment is impaired its recoverable value is tested and impairment losses are recognised as a
      deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding investments

      the eurotunnel group presents its share of the net result of equityaccounted investments whose operational nature is an extension to
      the groups activity on a specific line of the income statement between the operating profit and operating profit after share of result of
      equityaccounted companies lines


      iii intangible assets relating to commercial contracts
      intangible assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the commercial contracts


      iv tangible property plant and equipment and depreciation
      items of property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses property plant and
      equipment is depreciated on a systematic basis in order to write down the costs of assets over their expected useful lives as follows

            the concession expires in 2086
           the depreciation period has been determined for each ferry based on an expected useful life of 30 years from their first date of entry into service

      the expected useful lives of the assets are kept under review and revised when necessary according to experience

      concession property plant and equipment whose useful life is greater than the duration of the concession is depreciated over the life of
      the concession on a straight line basis depreciation on assets whose useful life is less than the duration of the concession renewable
      assets is calculated on a straight line basis

      as all property plant and equipment will be written down to nil at the end of the concession depreciation of the final renewal cost of
      renewable assets will be based on the residual duration of the concession

the calculation for depreciation of the ferries takes account of their estimated residual value at the end of their useful lives determined on
the basis of their scrap value

subsidies on capital expenditure received during the year have been allocated to the asset to which they relate


v impairment of tangible property plant and equipment
in accordance with ias 36 the carrying amounts of assets and groups of assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment

in the eurotunnel group each activity segment represents a cashgenerating unit cgu although in certain circumstances the cgu
may be made up of a single operating legal entity

if any indication of impairment exists an impairment test is carried out the net book value of the asset is compared to its recoverable
amount the recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and their value in use the net selling price is
determined by reference to studies carried out by independent experts

the value in use of cgus is calculated by discounting operating cash flows after taxation and capital expenditure incurred to replace
assets as forecast in the cgus business plan and validated by the groups management as part of its operational management the
period covered by the business plan is three years for concession assets cash flows are extrapolated on the basis of an assumption of
growth over the residual duration of the concession for nonconcession assets the extrapolation is complemented by a terminal value
which is calculated on the basis of infinite free cash flows that continue growing at a moderate rate below inflation the discount rate
retained is the wacc calculated per cgu at each year end an impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds its recoverable amount

goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test the recoverable value is calculated for the cgu to which the goodwill belongs


vi retirement liabilities
the group provides for its legal and contractual obligations for retirement indemnities of employees under french contracts and for the
defined benefit retirement schemes of employees under uk contracts operated by ctg and esl and gbrfs retirement scheme the
liability for defined benefits recorded in the statement of financial position is the present value of the obligation under defined benefit
plans at the end of the financial year less the fair value of plan assets these liabilities are valued using the actuarial method of projected
unit of credit on the basis of actuarial valuations made at the end of each financial year the current service cost of the period and the
interest on the obligation are accounted for in the staff benefit expense line of the consolidated income statement valuation of the
liability for defined benefit plans in respect of i actuarial gains and losses ii the actual return on plan assets and iii changes in the effect
of the asset ceiling benefits are recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income


vii provisions
provisions are recognised when there exists a legal or constructive obligation stemming from a past event and when the related future
cash flows can be reliably estimated


viii financial instruments
financial assets
in accordance with ias 39 the groups financial assets have been classified in one of the following four categories
 financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
 loans and receivables
 heldtomaturity investments
 availableforsale financial assets

the classification defines the accounting treatment of these instruments the classification is designated by the group at the date of
initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired the purchase and sale of financial assets are
accounted for on the transaction date being the date on which the group has contracted for the purchase or sale of the asset


financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
these are financial assets held by the group for the purpose of generating a shortterm profit or assets designated to this category
at inception

these assets are measured at their fair value with changes in the carrying amount being taken to the income statement



                                                                                    2014 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel groups assets
   and liabilities financial position and results


      these financial instruments include shortterm treasury investments which are classified as current assets in cash equivalents


      loans and receivables
      loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not listed on an active market and that are not
      held for trading purposes and are not available for sale

      these assets are initially measured at their fair value and subsequently at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate method
      for shortterm receivables that do not have a contractual rate of interest the fair value is assimilated to the original invoiced amount
      except where the effective interest rate has a significant impact

      these assets are subject to impairment tests if there is an indication of impairment losses an impairment loss is recognised whenever
      the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount

      receivables arising on shares and trade receivables are included in this category they are shown as financial assets and as trade
      receivables


      heldtomaturity investments
      heldtomaturity investments are financial assets other than loans and receivables with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
      maturity that the group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity at the end of the reporting period the group has not
      designated any financial asset to this category


      availableforsale financial assets
      all financial assets that are not classified in another category are classified as availableforsale they are measured at their fair value
      unrealised gains and losses are recognised in equity until the assets sale or derecognition however when there is objective evidence
      that an availableforsale asset may be impaired the cumulative net loss is recognised in profit or loss impairments on equity securities
      cannot be reversed in subsequent accounting periods the impairment criteria defined by the group for securities and shares securities
      with variable returns correspond to a prolonged or significant loss for debt instruments the impairment is only charged to the income
      statement when impairment is indicated that is related to a counterparty risk

      fair value for listed securities equates to the market price for unlisted securities the fair value is determined by reference to recent
      transactions or by using valuation techniques incorporating reliable and observable market data however when no reliable estimate of
      the fair value of a security can be made it is measured at historical cost these assets are subject to impairment tests to establish their
      recoverability

      this category includes shares in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and other financial assets


      financial liabilities
      financial liabilities include in accordance with ias 39
       loans and bank overdrafts
       derivative liabilities


      borrowings
      borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs and subsequently at amortised cost according to the effective
      interest rate method

      for financial liabilities that are at a fixed interest rate interest costs are recognised at a constant interest rate until maturity of the debt
      using the effective interest rate method the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts all of the contractual cash flows due
      on the debt until its maturity these cash flows are calculated on the basis of the estimated cash flows due on each instrument
      constituting the debt the calculation takes into account the transactionrelated costs and all other premiums and discounts

      for financial liabilities that are at a variable interest rate cash flows are periodically reestimated to reflect changes in market interest
      rates thereby changing the effective interest rate

      for financial liabilities that are at a fixed interest rate indexed to inflation cash flows are periodically reestimated to take account of actual
      fluctuations in the inflation rate thereby changing the effective interest rate

interest rate hedging instruments
all the derivative instruments are designed to hedge exposure to interest rate risk they are measured at market value and are used as
cash flow hedges

cash flow hedges the derivative instruments designed to hedge the floating rate element of the debt are accounted for as cash flow
hedges the portion of the gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value that is deemed to be an effective hedge is taken directly
to equity until the underlying transaction is recognised in the groups financial statements the portion deemed ineffective is accounted
for in the income statement for the period the gains and losses included in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period
when the hedged item affects the income statement the interest rate hedging instruments described in note u on financial liabilities
meet the criteria set out in ias 39 and are therefore accounted for as cash flow hedges


ix sharebased payments
share options are accounted for in accordance with ifrs 2 the options are valued at their fair value at the date on which they are
granted see note b4 below and any variations in value occurring after the grant date are not taken into account the value is charged to
employee benefits expense on a straight line basis between the date of the grant and the maturity date the vesting period with an equal
and opposite entry directly to equity


x treasury shares
get se shares held by the group are accounted for at cost as a reduction in equity subsequent disposals are taken directly to equity
and no profit or loss is recognised


xi foreign exchange
transactions in foreign currencies are converted into the reporting currency of each individual company at the rate of exchange ruling at
the date of the transaction assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than those mentioned in note b2i above are
translated at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting period exchange differences are dealt with in the income statement


xii revenue recognition
revenue comprises the value of sales of services in the normal course of business revenue is recognised on the date the service is
rendered that is to say when the transport occurs therefore when travel tickets are issued for the shuttle and the maritime activities
they are accounted for in deferred income


xiii net gains or net losses on each category of financial instrument
interest income and charges recognised in profit or loss include
 interest on the financial assets and liabilities accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method the calculation
     of the effective interest rate includes all commissions and margins payable or receivable between the contracting parties which are
     an integral part of the effective interest rate and all transaction costs and all other premiums and discounts the transaction costs
     are the marginal costs directly attributable to the acquisition issue or disposal of a financial asset or liability
 changes in the fair value of derivatives categorised as hedges for the ineffective portion


xiv income tax
income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax income tax is recognised in the income statement

current tax
current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of
the reporting period and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years

additional tax payable on the distribution of dividends is accounted for when the dividends are recognised as a liability


deferred tax
deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes except as provided by ias 12 income taxes

the tax rates used are those in effect at the end of the reporting period

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel groups assets
   and liabilities financial position and results


      deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable
      profits will be available against which the differences can be used at the level of the tax entity

      deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses are recognised according to the likelihood of their recoverability assessed on the basis of the
      groups budget and mediumterm plans the assumptions in these plans used are the same as those used for testing the value
      of assets


      b4 measurement of fair value
      the groups accounting policies require the measurement of its financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities at their fair value the fair
      value has been measured both for their valuation and for the presentation of information in the notes to the accounts in accordance
      with the following methods when necessary more detailed information relating to the assumptions used in the measurement of fair
      value is given in the notes on the asset or liability concerned


      non financial instruments
      tangible property plant and equipment
      the fair value of tangible property plant and equipment acquired following a business combination is measured by taking the higher of
      the net selling price or the value in use


      intangible assets
      the fair value of intangible assets acquired following a business combination is measured using the present value of forecast future cash
      flows after taxation to be generated by the assets concerned


      sharebased payments
      the fair value of stock option plans is measured by applying the binomial black  scholes model and the monte carlo approach the
      basis of calculation includes the share price on the grant date the exercise price of the options expected volatility of the underlying
      shares expected period before exercise expected dividends and share yield and the expected turnover of beneficiaries performance
      conditions which are not related to the market are not included in the fair value measurement

      financial instruments
      financial assets accounted for at their fair value are classified in accordance with the following levels of fair value
       level 1 fair value using quoted prices unadjusted observed in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
       level 2 fair value using data inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability
         either directly in the form of price or indirectly determined from the price
       level 3 fair value from valuation techniques which rely completely or in part on non observable data such as prices on an inactive
         market or the valuation on a multiples basis for non quoted securities


      cash and cash equivalents
      cash and cash equivalents include cash and shortterm investments with maturities less than or equal to three months from date of
      acquisition which do not carry a significant risk of variation in value and which are used by the group to manage short term
      commitments money market funds are evaluated at their market value at the end of the reporting period


      trade and other receivables
      the fair value of trade and other receivables is measured on the basis of their expected recoverable value this fair value is measured for
      the purpose of the information in the notes to the accounts as part of the receivables acquired following the business combinations

derivative instruments
the fair value of hedging instruments is measured on the basis of valuations supplied by the financial counterparties integrating the credit
risk cva or the counterparty risk dva


b5 financial indicators
the main financial indicators used are the following


i  ebitdaoperating margin
ebitda or operating margin as used by the group is calculated by adding back depreciation charges to the trading profit


ii distinction between the trading result and the operating result
the group considers that it is helpful to include an additional result line in the presentation of its income statement within the operating
result in order to understand better its financial performance this line is called the trading result and excludes income or charges
which are nonrecurrent in terms of their frequency and nature and for which the amount is significant the group therefore applies
recommendation number 201303 of the french national authority for accounting standards the autorite des normes comptables

the concession requires that the groups concessionaires ctg and fm share equally the cost price of the project and all revenues and
costs relating to the operation of the fixed link between the british and french companies operating revenues and costs are
recognised in the income statement of the partnership and are shared equally between the concessionaires revenues and costs which
do not relate to the operation of the concession are not subject to these sharing arrangements

      concession property plant and equipment
      the impact of taxation on property plant and equipment corresponds mainly to the conditions relating to the deductibility of the fixed
      links depreciation costs in the french tax group reintegration of impairment costs and in the british tax group profile of tax deductions
      in respect of depreciation including capital allowances

      deferred tax resulting from temporary differences on property plant and equipment will reverse over the period until the end of the
      concession in line with the profile of the groups depreciation charges and taxable results


      profit arising from the restructuring
      the financial restructuring in 2007 gave rise to profit in the consolidated accounts of c3323 million at 31 december 2014 the taxation
      of c1364 million of this amount remains deferred within the french tax group the taxation of this residual profit is dependent upon the
      repayment of a loan between the concessionaires fm and ctg and groupe eurotunnel se which in turn is subordinated to the term
      loan which matures in 2050

      deferred tax in respect of tax losses
      deferred tax assets recognised in respect of carried forward tax losses within the french and british tax groups amount to c275 million
      at 31 december 2014 c29 million for the french tax group and c246 million for the british tax group

      the recognition of these assets for each of the tax groups is based on
       the forecasts of taxable profits derived from the groups threeyear business plan for its different activities this plan is based on the
         same assumptions as those used in the impairment test of assets see note n below on the basis of these forecasts in respect of
         taxable profits the group has recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of carried forward losses which are expected to be utilised
         in the next 3 years for both the french and british tax groups
       the forecasts for use of carried forward losses to cover the reversal of temporary differences on the british tax group

at 31 december 2014 eurotunnel did not identify any indication of impairment of its tangible concession assets but nevertheless
carried out a valuation in order to ensure that the recoverable value of the assets remained higher than their net accounting value

the valuation carried out at 31 december 2014 confirmed that the recoverable value of assets remained higher than their net accounting
value on the basis of a discount rate of 677 31 december 2013 677 and on the basis of revenue growth of approximately 2 for
the period after the three year plan

expected cash outflows and risks associated with pension liabilities
the investment strategy for managing the assets of the pension schemes is defined by the trustees of the pension fund the maturities
of the contributions and the level of funding of schemes are negotiated between the group and the trustees on the basis of actuarial
valuations carried out every three years contributions are intended both to recover the deficit related to rights acquired in the past and
to cover the service costs in future years

the group estimates that contributions to be paid into the defined benefit schemes in the 2015 financial year will be c8 million of which
c6 million will be in respect of current service costs for the period and c2 million will be in respect of the recovery of the deficit in the
channel tunnel group pension fund the weighted average duration of the both the gbrf plan and the esl plan is 22 years

undertakings and prohibitions under the term loan
the term loan provides for a number of undertakings and prohibitions which are customary for this type of financing these relate to
 the creation of new or the continuation of existing guarantees on the assets of the eurotunnel group
 to the transfer of the assets of the eurotunnel group and to the acquisition by the eurotunnel group of new assets
 to the granting of loans guarantees or warranties to third parties and
 the amendment of contracts which were conditions precedent for utilisation of the loans under the term loan including inter alia the
   railway usage contract

in relation to the term loan the eurotunnel group must respect two financial ratios one of which if not met would constitute an event
of default see section on event of default and acceleration below the second ratio is the ratio of operating cash flow to the total
synthetic debt service on the term loan get se is required to ensure that at each sixmonthly test date after 31 december 2007 this
ratio is not less than 125 for the purposes of this test the ratio is calculated taking into account the hypothetical amortisation on the
term loan and on the basis of a rolling 12 month period prior to the date of the test failure to meet this ratio on a sixmonthly testing
date would lead to restrictions on the use of the groups excess available cash flow on the date of the next interest payment on the term
loan until such time as the test is met once again these restrictions include in particular the ability of the eurotunnel group to pay
dividends and to finance new activities failure to meet this test on three consecutive six monthly testing dates would trigger a
prepayment event under which the groups excess available cash flow would have to be used towards prepayment of the term loan
until the testing date on which the ratio is met once again

        recorded directly in equity


in accordance with ifrs 13 the group takes into account credit risk dva and counterparty risk cva in the valuation of financial
instruments in practice this recommendation particularly affects the valuation of derivatives to the extent that they are measured at fair
value including a probabilistic weighting of estimated cash flows

in the case of a default by the eurotunnel group counterparties to the hedging contracts have priority over all holders of debt and
securities and guarantees granted to holders of debt under the concession contract and the intercreditor deed in this respect the
group believes that the risk of loss for the counterparties in the event of default is insignificant and therefore has not recorded a discount
to the fair value of hedging instruments under the dva

the table in note w2 below gives the periods in which the cash flows associated with the derivatives are expected to occur and the
periods in which the amounts initially recognised in equity are expected to impact the income statement

on 28 june 2007 eurotunnel took out a longterm loan totalling c3810 million nominal value at the end of the reporting period on
31 december 2014 from a banking consortium comprising goldman sachs international and deutsche bank ag with a spread of
139 basis points this debt is accounted for at its amortised cost

the term loan is not quoted or traded on an active financial market and it is particularly difficult to identify any observable market
equivalents taking into account the specificities and characteristics of the eurotunnel groups debt and in particular its 30 to 40year
maturity profile see note w2 below

the groups estimate of the fair value of the longterm loan is based on a level 3 fair value

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel groups assets
   and liabilities financial position and results


      the modelling techniques used involve the discounting of future cash flows determined at the calculation date the discounting
      parameters are derived from a zerocoupon curve and an estimated credit spread based on a sample of comparable bbb rated
      companies the eurotunnel groups rating has remained unchanged since 2007 with an adjustment to take into account the particularly
      long maturity of the groups debt

      on this basis the eurotunnel group estimates the fair value of the term loan to be c5400 million compared to a carrying value at
      31 december 2014 of c4084 million as an indication if the rate used including the credit spread was 100 basis points higher the fair
      value of the term loan would be approximately c700 million lower with regard to the methodology used the eurotunnel group does
      not prejudge the conditions that may be obtained on the market furthermore the characteristics of the current funding agreements
      govern any prepayment or refinancing operations on the term loan and the resulting gains that may arise for the group

      approximately half of the eurotunnel groups revenues are denominated in sterling whereas more than half of its operating expenses
      and capital expenditure are in euros the term loan is denominated in sterling for a total of 1467 billion and in euros for a total of
      c1926 billion at 31 december 2014 all the external financial instruments are denominated either in sterling or in euros as a result no
      exchange gain or loss can arise on revaluation of the external financial instruments the residual foreign exchange risk relates to the
      revaluation of intragroup balances the residual value of which at 31 december 2014 is c58 million a 10 change in the eurosterling
      parity would result in unrealised exchange gains or losses of approximately c6 million

      the eurotunnel group has and will continue to make every effort to closely match the currencies in which its revenues and costs are
      denominated and will use currency hedging transactions to manage its foreign exchange risk where necessary groupe eurotunnel se
      prepares its consolidated accounts in euros fluctuations in the value of the sterlingeuro rates have an impact on the value in euros of
      revenues costs and financial income and costs as well as on elements of the groups reported assets and liabilities by way of example
      and all else being equal and on the basis of accounting information at 31 december 2014 the table below presents the effect that a
      change of plus or minus 10 in the exchange rate would have on the main financial indicators

            tranches a1 and a2 are indexed with inflation and are presented in the liquidity table on the basis of the groups medium and long term budgetary
             assumptions
           tranches c1 and c2 are at a variable rate of interest and are presented in the liquidity table on the basis of a longterm interest rate at the end of the
             reporting period


      the credit agreements allow on condition that the debt service cover ratio is not less than 125 to apply for i a renewable credit line of
      up to c75 million and ii a structurally subordinated additional credit line of up to 225 million or equivalent in euros


      w3 interest rate risk exposure
      the risk of an unfavourable movement in rates during the duration of the term loan is covered by the fact that tranches b1 and b2 are at
      a fixed rate of interest tranches a1 and a2 which are indexed on inflation are at a fixed rate of interest and tranches c1 and c2 are at a
      variable rate of interest but are covered by fixedvariable rate hedging contracts shortterm receivables and debts are not at risk from
      interest rate exposure

      the contractual cash flows associated with the swaps are paid simultaneously with the contractual cash flows of the variable rate loans
      and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period where the interest on the debt affects the result

the groups standard credit terms the groups credit risk exposure to account customers is managed by means of continuous
monitoring of their financial situation and of their outstanding debt in regard to their credit limits and payment terms

6 months with counterparties with a minimum shortterm rating of p1 from moodys or ii in monetary sicavs the french equivalent of
mutual funds and money market funds with a minimum longterm rating of aaa from moodys or aaa from sp

exceed 65 million or c78 million with any one bank group

another subsidiary of eurotransmanche holding sas myferrylink sas

on 9 january 2015 the competition appeal tribunal rejected the appeal made by the eurotunnel group and scop seafrance and
confirmed the decision of the competition and markets authority that the eurotunnel group must cease operating these ferries out of
the port of dover within the next six months the decision of the competition and markets authority was based on the assumption that
the eurotunnel group had acquired seafrances business an interpretation that the group has always contested

the eurotunnel group decided not to appeal this decision and announced that it intends to seek a buyer for myferrylink and the three
ferries due to the condition imposed by the tribunal de commerce at the time of their purchase in 2012 prohibiting the sale of the ferries

      the eurotunnel group on the other hand pursuant to a settlement agreement have agreed to definitively end litigation regarding the
      safeguard proceeding opened in august 2006 and the safeguard plans that were then subsequently approved this settlement
      agreement does not result in any of the parties thereto bearing a burden of significant undertakings


      2082 uk competition commission

      in 2012 the group arranged to purchase certain assets including three ferries belonging to former maritime company seafrance on
      8 november 2012 the french competition authority authorised this purchase subject to certain commitments risks to competition in
      the passenger market were ruled out for freight transport the eurotunnel group has agreed for a period of five years not to offer any
      discounts on its crosschannel rail freight transport rates that would be contingent on the customer also using its maritime transport
      service specifically it may not base annual rate negotiations on the volume of freight transported by myferrylink the eurotunnel group
      has also agreed not to discriminate in any way against customers who do not use myferrylink for their crosschannel maritime freight
      transport to make sure it honours these commitments the prices charged to freight customers will have to be negotiated by different
      sales teams for each mode of transport and are covered by separate contracts an independent trustee is in charge of monitoring these
      commitments

      the matter was referred to the uk competition commission which has since become the competition and markets authority or cma
      on 19 february 2013 the cc revealed the results of its preliminary analysis finding that the entry of a new operator myferrylink would
      substantially lessen competition and that the sale of seafrance assets to another operator would have been better for competition in the
      crosschannel market the group challenged this analysis on 6 june 2013 the cma announced its decision to ban groupe
      eurotunnel se or any related entity from directly or indirectly operating ferry services from the port of dover for a period of ten years
      using the berlioz or rodin or for a period of two years using any other vessel

following an appeal by groupe eurotunnel se and the scop seafrance on 4 december 2013 the competition appeal tribunal
quashed the cmas decision of 6 june 2013 the tribunal found that the cma by failing to demonstrate that groupe eurotunnel se had
acquired an enterprise rather than individual assets had not demonstrated that it had jurisdiction in the matter the tribunal therefore
remitted to the cma the question of whether the eurotunnel group had acquired an enterprise

on 27 june 2014 the cma reaffirmed its jurisdiction considering that eurotunnel had taken over seafrance and that this takeover was
within the uk merger rules enabling it to examine the operation the cma concluded that myferrylink must cease its activities in a
period of six months from the date of the order being issued by the cma giving its decision eurotunnel group and the scop appealed
this decision to the competition appeal tribunal

to consult with stakeholders the cma issued on 23 july 2014 the draft ruling to ban the eurotunnel group from serving the port of
dover with its ferries in this context groupe eurotunnel made a number of observations to the cma

on 18 september 2014 the cma issued a final order dismissing all of the observations of the eurotunnel group this order prohibits
myferrylink continuing its activity with this destined to apply six months after a possible decision rejecting an appeal by eurotunnel
against the decision of the cma

on 9 january 2015 the cat recognised the validity of the arguments presented by the group but felt that they were not of a nature to
quash again the position taken by the cma on 18 september 2014 the cat forced the group to withdraw from this activity before the
ban to operate within six months was made and to value the work done the eurotunnel group decided to seek a buyer for the
myferrylink company the scop has again appealed the decision to the court of appeal and the hearing was held on 11 and
12 march 2015 the date of the decision is as yet unknown


2083 igc

on 4 june 2013 the igc announced that eurostar had lodged a claim against the fee structure resulting from the 2014 network
statement relating to the use of the tunnel

in accordance with the rule of procedure of 25 october 2005 intergovernmental commission rule of procedure for the consideration
of appeals brought under article 12 of the regulation on the use of the channel tunnel by international groupings or railway
undertakings signed at london on 25 october 2005 the intergovernmental commission igc set the timetable and arrangements for
examination of the appeal filed with the igc by eurostar eil

substantively the claim argued that the pricing information contained in the 2014 network statement was not compliant with regulation
since it failed to mention how the costs incurred by the rail infrastructure manager were related to the fees charged it does not challenge
the level of charging nor the amount of revenue the eurotunnel group has contested both the nature of the loss alleged by eil and the
jurisdiction and independence of the igc to hear the claim

on 5 december 2013 the igc confirmed that eurotunnel ought to recover through its fees the longterm costs of the fixed link from
rail operators using the tunnel in accordance with the procedures established under the railway usage contract the eurotunnel
group applies this longterm cost recovery method in accordance with article 82 of european directive 200114ec the railways are
still able to audit these costs the eurotunnel group provides the igc with the necessary information in strict compliance with european
directives the eurotunnel group is continually improving the quality of its network statement to make it as comprehensive as possible
for the record the network statement has been published on the eurotunnel groups website since the market opened up to
competition in 2007

as a precaution the eurotunnel group has brought a procedural appeal against the igc decision before the court of appeal of paris
the parties are awaiting the procedural timetable to be determined by the court of appeal of paris

2225 assignment and substitution by lenders

the concession agreement provides that each of the concessionaires has the right to transfer the concession agreement or the rights
it confers with the agreement of the states

in addition upon the occurrence of one of the events set out below and for as long as the effects of the event persist or any other action
or intention that could lead to the termination of the concession agreement the lenders approved as such by the states pursuant to the
concession agreement the lenders may request of the states that substitution be operated in favour of entities controlled by them
the substituted entities if i the concessionaires fail to pay within a contractual grace period any sum due and payable under the
terms of the finance documents ii the concessionaires do not have and cannot procure sufficient funds to finance the forecasted
operating costs of the fixed link and the related finance charges iii it appears that the date of full and final payment of all claims of the
lenders must be postponed for a significant length of time or iv in the event of the fixed link being abandoned suspension of
payments liquidation enforcement of security by other creditors or similar events

the substituted entities must prove to the states at the time of the substitution that they have sufficient technical and financial capacity
to continue performance of the concession agreement

for the sole benefit of the concessionaires such that the extension would not apply if the lenders exercised their substitution right

in accordance with article 32 of the concession agreement the lenders of the term loan have been approved by the states as lenders
able to benefit from the substitution right under the terms set out in the concession agreement

changes in tax or customs legislation have a discriminatory effect on the fixed link the relevant state will examine the issue with the
concessionaires furthermore in accordance with article 19 of the concession agreement as a matter of principle the concessionaires
share equally between ctg and fm at cost price all expenses and all revenues from the fixed link for the period during which they
operate it to this end the consequences of any indirect taxation on the supply of goods or services levied only on one of the
concessionaires will be taken into account in the costs to be shared any equalising payment made between fm and ctg will be
treated as a capital expense or a revenue payment as determined by the tax legislation of the two states

with respect to the period between 2052 and 2086 the concessionaires will be obliged to pay to the states a total annual sum
including all corporate taxes of any kind whatsoever equal to 59 of all pretax profits


2227 litigation

relevant provisions of the treaty of canterbury and the concession agreement provisions of french or english law may if necessary be
applied if this is dictated by the performance of specific obligations under french or english law relevant principles of international law
and if the parties so agree the principles of equity may be applied

      commitments relating to maintenance of the fixed link pursuant to the railway usage contract the railways are authorised to use up
      to 50 of the capacity of the fixed link per hour and in each direction up until 2052

      charges depending on the number of passengers travelling on passenger trains and the freight tonnage carried through the fixed link
      adjustment mechanisms for annual charges are set out in the event that the fixed link is unavailable finally under the railway usage
      contract the railways must pay a contribution to the concessionaires operating costs to this end the railways make monthly
      provisional payments to the concessionaires against operating costs for the current period payments are subsequently adjusted to
      take account of real operating costs with the final amount of the contribution determined in accordance with the formula set out in the
      railway usage contract

      in addition the strategy for the relaunch of freight services offers a simplified pricing structure mechanism for goods trains with a toll per
      freight train rather than per tonne of freight based on a charging regime published annually by eurotunnel in its network statement

      a substantial majority of the eurotunnel groups revenues emanating from its rail network see chapter 6 is made up of the annual fixed
      and variable charges as referred to above

      conditions to work with the entities to which execution of these obligations had been delegated to ensure the development of
      passenger train services and goods train services

      225 master intragroup debt agreement

      intragroup debts existed between the various companies of the group some of them were expressed in contracts concluded between
      2007 and 2009 for the financial restructuring or simplification of the structure of the group intragroup debts certain of these intra
      group debts for which contracts were concluded in 2007 were reorganised in 2009 as part of the transactions prior to the merger of
      tnu sa into get se which gave rise to the conclusion of new contracts for intragroup loans

      the intragroup debts because they were concluded over a period from 2007 to 2009 and partly reorganised in 2009 had different
      characteristics as to interest rate and maturity which complicated the financial and accounting management of group companies

      group companies have therefore concluded a contract entitled the master intragroup debt agreement the principal object of which
      is the harmonisation of i the rules for current accounts between group companies ii the interest rates of the various intragroup debts
      and iii where possible the other conditions of these intragroup debts in order to facilitate the financial and accounting management of
      group companies and to reflect the financial policy between the groups companies




      226 maritime activity

      on 11 june 2012 the paris commercial court issued an order authorising the liquidator of seafrance to sell three ferries belonging to the
      former shipping company in insolvent liquidation since 9 january 2012 to the eurotunnel group the eurotunnel group purchased the
      berlioz rodin and nordpasdecalais ferries in addition to other sundry assets for c65 million with an inalienability clause for the
      vessels lasting five years on the basis of the provisions of article l 64110 of the french commercial code the purchase of these
      ferries was carried out by three subsidiaries of get se eurotransmanche sas eurotransmanche 3 be and eurotransmanche
      3 npc

      the maritime activity has been structured around a chain of marine charters based on a bareboat charter with the scop seafrance
      workers cooperative

      under the terms of the bareboat chartering contract the charter operator the party providing the vessel hire undertakes to make
      available to the charterer the party hiring the vessel a ship for a given period of time with no fittings or crew three bareboat charter
      parties have been entered into in this manner between the companies owning the ferries and the scop seafrance workers
      cooperative under the terms of these charters eurotransmanche sas eurotransmanche 3 be and eurotransmanche 3 npc have
      handed over the fitting out and nautical management of their ferries to scop seafrance while the latter is prohibited from
      subchartering the ferries in any way and from any commercial operation of said ferries without the prior agreement of the three ferry
      owning companies in addition the charterer guarantees the charter operator against any thirdparty claims which may arise as a result
      of operation of the ferries

      myferrylink sas subcharters ferry capacity to ensure that marine transport services are marketed to third parties the marketing of
      freight crossings is performed directly by myferrylink sas while the marketing of passenger crossings is subcontracted to dover
      calais ferries ltd

      myferrylink sas has no stake in the in the share capital of the scop nor any veto right in strategic decisions of the latter myferrylink
      sas buys crossings from the scop and markets its services myferrylink sas employs its own sales and administrative staff and it
      alone determines its corporate business strategy the scop acts only as an external providersubcontractor which operates the cross
      channel services while the eurotunnel group owns the vessels and benefits from the profits and suffers the potential losses of
      this activity

      corporate social responsibility
                                                                                                                           
      the eurotunnel groups social and environmental reporting is based on information stipulated in article 225 of french law no 2010788
      of 12 july 2010 known as grenelle 2 and the transparency principles of the global reporting initiative gri

      for this year the eurotunnel group has decided to submit three new workforce indicators to detailed testing by an independent third
      party as a proactive step to ensure reasonable rather than moderate assurance of the obligations moreover the group has introduced a
      partially automated reporting system for the inputting gathering and consolidation of environmental data this tool has been deployed
      to the contributors of each subsidiary within the scope of reporting

      the group also decided to make a further step towards greater transparency of its approach and relevance of the information provided
      by introducing for next year four new social indicators

      the groups csr data is consolidated under the responsibility of the group human resources department


      consolidation period for csr reporting
      the period used for annual reporting of workforce and societal data is the calendar year 1 january 2014 to 31 december 2014

      environmental data however is reported on a rolling year basis from 1 october 2013 to 30 september 2014 as data and supporting
      evidence for the full year is not available within a timescale compatible with the publication date of the registration document


      scope of consolidation
      data is consolidated for all group entities including myferrylink for certain social information as at 31 december 2014 on the
      environmental side the absence of reporting and the transitory nature of the situation of the ferries with the entry into force on
      1 january 2015 of the marpol marine pollution regulations justified the exclusion of myferrylink from the scope of consolidation for the
      2014 financial year

      choice of indicators
      the purpose of the indicators is to monitor the commitments made by the group and its progress in terms of environmental and
      workforce performance the indicators were chosen by the group because they are appropriate to its activities and serve the needs of
      stakeholders as well as it regulatory obligations

      workforce indicators have been chosen to
       measure the results of the human resources policy and the groups social commitments
       take account of cultural differences and local disparities different national law varying legal obligations etc

      environmental indicators have been chosen to
       serve environmental policy and reflect progress in the groups different activities the indicators chosen are appropriate to the
         groups activities
       allow monitoring of the groups performance on key environmental issues


      internal consolidation and control
      workforce information is collected from each entity through the computerised data feedback system which includes consistency
      checks the data is checked and validated by the group entities and consolidated across the entire scope by the group human
      resources department

      each entitys environmental information is collected through the computerised data feedback system the data is checked and validated
      by each group entity and is then consolidated by the group human resources department

during consolidation of workforce and environmental data consistency checks are carried out at the group level comparisons are
made with the results from previous years and discrepancies deemed significant are analysed and examined in greater detail

societal information is collected checked and validated at the level of each entity it is then centralised by the group human resources
department

further information and methodological limits of the indicators collected
the methodologies used for some workforce and environmental indicators may in practice be limited by
 a lack of harmonisation in nationalinternational definitions and legislation
 the representativeness of the measurements taken or limited availability of external data needed to calculate the indicator
 the qualitative and therefore subjective nature of some data
 the practical methods used to collect and input this data

the calculation of emissions of greenhouse gases is based on the methodology developed by the carbon trust

waste generated by operations on customers sites in respect of monitoring of the activities of contractors is excluded from the scope
of reporting

the sites for which natural gas consumption data was not available for all or part of the reporting period have been estimated on the
basis of average consumption using the ademes bilan carbone method

water consumption for unmetered sites was extrapolated by applying a ratio of water consumption in m3 per employee present on site
this ratio was calculated from sites which are metered

as none of gbrfs sites are equipped with metres europorte frances ratio has been applied as their activities are similar

gbrfs electricity consumption was limited to sites equipped a meter however this covers more than 97 of the staff attached to a site
ie the total number of staff less mobile and homeworking staff

some data which was not available for all or part of the reporting period and which was necessary for the calculation of absenteeism
frequency rate and the managementtostaff ratio has been estimated in accordance with the methodologies described in the reference
sheets

the number of staff in 2013 was adjusted to 3747 compared to 3744 previously reported this change related to staff of british entities
following a refinement of the methodology the change which is not material was only made in the reporting system and not in the
groups publications

in the calculation of the rate of absenteeism for the four french europorte entities the number of scheduled hours is obtained by
multiplying the number of fulltime equivalent staff by the number of theoretical hours

moreover the gross payroll and employers charges are not reported for eight employees located in different european countries spain
netherlands and germany due to the collection methods however the scope of these indicators covers 998 of the groups staff

the training budget is the sum of logistics costs external costs and the related staff costs this last component has been estimated in
2013 and 2014 for the entity gbrf on the basis of gross payroll divided by the number of hours worked and then multiplied by the total
number of training hours conducted by the subsidiary

external audit
in order to ensure that it provides reliable information each year the eurotunnel group requests the opinion of independent third party
regarding the quality of its workforce and environmental information collection and reporting procedures in 2014 the audit was carried
out by mazars the 2014 assurance report expresses reasonable assurance for three environmental and seven social indicators
information marked  and limited assurance for the other indicators verified

challenges and commitments
                                                                                                                           
csr at the heart of the group plan
corporate social responsibility csr requires companies to integrate environmental and social issues into their business model and
plan a selfregulation initiative which in its early days was adopted on a voluntary basis csr has been enshrined in a regulatory
framework initiated in france since 20012002 by the law on new economic regulations ner the verification of sociological social
and environmental data by an independent third party has gone on to become obligatory for french businesses following the publication
in 2012 of the decree implementing article 225 of the grenelle 2 law and subsequently the ruling of 13 may 2013 eurotunnel group has
exceeded this obligation and its initiative goes beyond simple verification

eurotunnel group places social responsibility at the heart of its activities and in its interactions with its various internal and external
stakeholders and provides clear information about its commitments to its partners employees customers suppliers shareholders
investors territorial collectivities governments associations and communities true to its principles it has operated a policy for more
than twenty years which is both challenging and supportive of corporate social responsibility which it applies in three main areas the
strategic areas of focus linked to its activities
 people ie each of the more than 3900 eurotunnel group collaborators
 nature in other words the environment and the ecosystems with which its increasing activities interact
 region or all communities with which the group has a relationship particularly in france the uk and europe

eurotunnel group has developed a csr policy which is based on the respect of fundamental rights as defined by the major founding
international texts the universal declaration of human rights and the international labour organizations declaration on fundamental
principles and rights at work

the eurotunnel group board of directors and its chief executive officer fully support the principles stated in these international codes
and standards the object of this policy is to translate this support into a set of operational procedures defining a common approach for
all group entities

compliance with this policy will be continuously monitored under the close scrutiny of the groups board of directors supported by the
committee for sustainable development stakeholders shall also be informed of the policy via the groups various annual reports

the csr targets will be defined each year and will form part of the targets set for the directors and managers of the various group
entities they shall be monitored and evaluated during individual annual reviews

each manager shall be charged with ensuring that the stated principles are communicated to all employees and are further understood
and observed by them

challenges
eurotunnel group has identified five major challenges which correspond to core issues set out in the major founding texts and the
various international frameworks and standards global compact grl iso 26000 these challenges can be split into several
categories social regional environmental economic and ethical
 social challenges respect the rights of employees
 regional challenges develop close links with the region
 environmental challenges reduce the impact of the business activity on the environment
 economic challenges manage relationships with customers
 ethical challenges continue with policy development and value sharing within the group in connection with stakeholders

answering these challenges has been and remains a priority for eurotunnel group which since its inception has been committed to a
social responsibility policy reconciling economic performance social equity and environmental protection as part of a programme of
continuous improvement


social challenges
for the group responding to the social challenges involves a commitment to fully support a work environment which fosters the
personal development and growth of its workers the human resources policies are developed on the basis of criteria which support




                                                                             2014 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se
                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                              267


iv csr policy principles challenges and commitments

      truly equal opportunities and treatment for all employees in its charter of ethics and behaviour eurotunnel group has effectively
      committed itself to combating all forms of discrimination in the same charter it strongly reasserts its adherence to the principles and
      values of the universal declaration of human rights 1948 and to the fundamental conventions of the international labour organization
      as well as to the principles of the united nations global compact

      in order to reinforce the development of its workers and to guarantee a stable and safe working environment for them eurotunnel group
      has made the issue of improving security and health at work a major concern with the renewed and expressed target of zero accidents
      mindful of the progression of its employees performance the group considers the individual annual review to be an essential
      management tool for human resources and has therefore set a target for all managers in the company of 100 reviews

      the group invests heavily in young people and is developing its relationships with universities and schools with the aim of fostering a
      better understanding of its business and of better integrating young people into the world of work this is why an agreement was signed
      in january 2013 with the ecole nationale des ponts et chaussees creating for a period of 5 years an education and research chair for the
      science of railway transport dedicated to the study of railway activity the aim of this chair is training and research on the topics
      associated with infrastructure transport service this initiative attests to eurotunnel groups willingness to share its expertise in order to
      advance science and innovation and position the railway sector as a forwardlooking business

      eurotunnel group also is also strongly focused on training for careers in the railway sector created by the group in 2011 the
      international railway training centre ciffco contributes to the creation of skilled jobs and professional integration it plays a leading role
      in the development of railway transport and its associated businesses and more generally plays a part in the economic development
      and influence of the nordpasdecalais region


      regional challenges
      as a committed partner in its economic and social environment eurotunnel group has always been a leading economic actor and local
      employer as part of its mission it fully subscribes to a logic of community involvement understood as defined by iso 26000
      proactive outreach work undertaken by an organisation within the community with the aim of preventing and solving problems
      fostering partnerships with local organisations and stakeholders and being a good citizen of the community

      eurotunnel group has contributed to the creation of several thousand direct indirect and induced jobs in kent and the calais region and
      has as part of its role as a developer strongly contributed to the growth of the local economy at either end of the tunnel and to the
      positive transformation of the environment in which it operates

      eurotunnel group is conscious of the fact that community involvement is not limited to responsibility for the impact of its activities on the
      environment but involves responsible behaviour and good citizenship it is also constantly seeking ways to strengthen its integration into
      its immediate environment by means of firm commitments and actions of solidarity geared towards the community the group also
      supports education and culture and is conscious that sharing knowledge is a factor which promotes more equal opportunities

      eurotunnel group estimates that its regional commitment is essential as it contributes to the companys overall performance to the
      internal climate and social cohesion and to the loyalty of its employees

      in order to meet these challenges eurotunnel group is committed to strengthening links with local communities by actively supporting
      associations schools universities and organisations with which it closely collaborates on both sides of the fixed link


      environmental challenges
      in a world with limited natural resources companies cannot ensure their continuity without making constant efforts to control their
      energy consumption and reduce the impact of their activities on the environment for eurotunnel group it is clear it is impossible to have
      success in the long term without better control of environmental impacts

      committed to lowcarbon transportation the group is pursuing an ambitious strategy which combines developing its core activity 
      crosschannel transport  and external growth beyond the fixed link in its two major disciplines and areas of expertise the
      management of infrastructures and railway operations

      prior to the construction of the tunnel expense was incurred in order to prevent the harmful consequences of business activities for the
      environment there are two separate sewer systems for storm water and waste water retention ponds treatment stations etc
      furthermore an environmental management system based on the requirements of standard iso 14001 was put in place by the
      concessionaires in 2002
