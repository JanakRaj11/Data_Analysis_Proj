   through innovative environmental care measures we are committed
   to environmental measures that respect aquatic biodiversity and
   natural environment oocl continually invests in environmentally
   friendly equipment such as ballast water treatment and uses

   giving back  supporting education

   in july 2013 our colleagues in dhaka bangladesh volunteered some
   of their free time to play with a group of street children at a makeshift
   school set up by a charity organisation called change the lives
   this makeshift school was located on one side of a railway station
   platform

   the charity organisation also helped arrange for these children to
   attend a governmentrun primary school in tongi close to the station
   area so that they can now enjoy the benefits of a formal education

   although primary education is free in bangladesh and the
   government provides all books to primary students they have to carry
   the books by hand as they are not given school bags nor can their
   parents afford to buy them with this in mind in december 2015 our
   colleagues donated school bags to these children in order to support
   their education
