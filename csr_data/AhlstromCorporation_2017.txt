from the ceo
the year 2016 was historical for ahlstrom in many ways we achieved a record
high profitability and announced our intention to merge with munksj√∂




the year 2016 was historical for ahlstrom in many ways in terms of financial
performance we achieved a record high profitability and operating cash flow in
the current structure and portfolio of the company we also announced our
intention to merge with munksj√∂ oyj to create a leader in sustainable and
innovative fiberbased materials
there were several reasons behind our excellent performance as many pieces
came together favorably last year i was very pleased that we were able to grow
the company again in the latter part of 2016 after several years of stagnation at
the same time we able to boost our margins through our leaner operating model
and enhanced commercial excellence we executed our strategy very well on
pricing management in an environment where many variable costs were lower
than in previous years
the growth was mainly driven by higher sales of wallcover and glass fiber
materials as well as laboratory and life science diagnostics and single serve
coffee products there was a healthy balance between our own actions and more
favorable market conditions which occurred particularly in the filtration and wind

energy industries our much stronger balance sheet has given us more flexibility
and the decision to upgrade our madisonville filtration materials plant in the usa
was our first growth investment decision in five years in addition our efforts to
grow through new platforms paid off as we won breakthroughs in the fast
growing north american and european markets for singleserve coffee products
with our fully compostable solutions
towards a new era
we clearly accelerated the pace of executing on our strategy and came close to
reaching our 2018 financial target of over eight percent adjusted operating
margin already in 2016 the company was able to increase its margin from 13
percent to 74 percent of net sales in a mere three years last year also brought a
leadership change as i was appointed in november to lead ahlstrom until the
completion of the merger with munksj√∂ most of the initiatives behind our
improved performance as well as our current strategy were formed under the
leadership of my predecessor marco levi who left the company following the
merger announcement i would like to offer my warmest thanks to marco for his
great work and achievement
the planned merger with munksj√∂ is a major strategic milestone in the recent
history of ahlstrom the combination will create substantial value to our
stakeholders by offering further opportunities for growth and improved
operational efficiency a strong balance sheet and cash generation will support
the growth of the combined company
i would like to thank all of our stakeholders and our customers and employees in
particular for the successful year of 2016 in addition to the allimportant daily
business activities in 2017 our focus will be on completing the merger and the
subsequent integration of the two companies
sincerely yours

procurement and operations
our products are sold to converters that are for example filter manufacturers
wallpaper producers medical converters and building products companies their
customers are again brand owners who sell to consumers via distributors and
retailers there are many variations to the overall value chain and in some cases
ahlstrom has moved vertically in the value chain eg in lateral flow analysis for
medical diagnostics




responsible global procurement
ahlstrom has a global sourcing organization serving all our businesses and
plants it is important to us that the production and supply of our raw materials
does not cause harm to people the environment or society we have a supplier
code of conduct in place and signing of the code is included in our sourcing key
performance indicators all new suppliers must sign the code before conducting
business with ahlstrom in 2016 all of our revelant suppliers had signed the code
our key raw materials are described in the environmental performance section
renewable fibers are our most important raw material and we have an extensive
company verification program to ensure that they come from legally harvested
forests sgs sa has verified our due diligence system for the european union

                                                               52

timber regulation for five years the purpose of this system is to prevent
ahlstrom from placing illegal timber products on the eu market we conduct the
same due diligence procedures for all pulps we buy adhering also to the us
lacey act and the australian illegal logging prohibition regulation forestry
certification is a mechanism using independent thirdparty assurance that the
forest in question is managed according to internationally recognized
sustainability criteria the forest stewardship council fsc and the program for
the endorsement of forest certification pefc are the two major international
systems for forest certification buying wood pulp with a forest certification claim
means
    no illegally harvested wood
    no human rights violations in the supply chain
    no wood harvested from high conversation value forests
    no deforestation ie no wood harvested in forests being converted to
    plantations or nonforest use
    no wood from forests where genetically modified trees are planted
all of ahlstroms pulp suppliers in 2016 were certified according to one of these
programs or both while 78 of the pulp was purchased as fsc or pefc certified
or fsc controlled wood all inputs are covered additionally by our own
verification system for legality
chainofcustody certification is a way of tracking woodbased raw materials
from the forest to the consumer at each change in ownership at the end of 2016
we had 16 certified plants as three new plants in the us received their
certification during the year apart from one all major ahlstrom plants using
wood fiber are now chainofcustody certified a detailed list of certifications can
be found on our website

operations

and less complexity within the company in 2016 higher operational efficiency
resulted in lower production waste and supported improvement in key
environmental performance indicators

certified production
one of our key objectives is to have an environmental management system in
place in each plant this target was achieved in 2016 as 100 of the production
had an iso14001 certification 94 in 2015 as all of ahlstroms manufacturing
sites were certified a detailed list of certifications can be found on our website 
our aim is to minimize the impact from our operations and all of them have
implemented precautionary actions to diminish any harm they would do to the
environment this means that in case of threats of serious damage a lack of full
scientific certainty is not used as a reason for postponing costeffective measures
to prevent environmental degradation to the environment

raw materials
overall we spent approximately eur 514 million on raw materials in 2016
expenditure on pulp and natural fibers was about eur 213 million on synthetic
fibers about 142 million and on chemicals about eur 159 million energy
expenditure was about eur 77 million overall raw materials and energy account
for about 60 of our total cost base
by far the most important raw material for us is fiber with about 70 of the total
in 2016 79 of the fibers we used as raw material came from renewable sources
compared with 82 in 2015 the vast majority or about 90 of the renewable
fibers is wood pulp from forests we source pulp from suppliers principally
located in the nordic countries and south and north america viscose fiber used
in some specialties is also made from forest fiber
other natural fibers that we use include annual fibers such as abaca cotton
linters jute and some sisal and flax abaca which is used in our food grades is
clearly the most important of them abaca is sourced from the philippines as well
as ecuador
we buy our synthetic fiber from producers that are located in europe asia and
north and south america our main chemical suppliers are very large companies
but chemicals are also purchased from mediumsized specialty producers
generally based in europe and north america

process of acquiring the certification during 2017 the total number of
certifications rose from three to five

energy monitoring system
the main project in our energy efficiency program was the initiation of the energy
monitoring system this is a cloudbased tracking system for each plant and their
processes onsite monitoring provides real time consumption data of each energy
source and tracks the achievements in energy expenditure the tool provides a
more visual approach to the actual daytoday consumption with alerts and
reports
in the future this approach will support the forecasting of energy consumption and
demand side management activities for key plants this will also compliment
procurement activities in the longer term

energy savings projects
we have been working on numerous projects to reduce energy consumption at our
plants by supporting investments and continuous improvement in process
optimization we have been able to achieve savings in energy consumption most
significantly on process heat
our plants have been classified into three groups first of all we have the socalled
top8 which are the biggest consumers of energy our focus has been on the
performance of these sites and many of the energy savings projects and related
investments have been carried out at these locations various process
improvements have been implemented and the monitoring systems for
consumption have been updated
the second group are known as medium plants which are potential sites to
implement energy management overall but are clearly smaller than the top8 sites
projects related to compressed air led lighting and other continuous
improvement have been executed at these plants
the third group we have are the minor plants whose energy expenditure is similar
to regular office buildings these plants have mainly focused on the efficient use of

emissions
highlights in 2016
      higher operational efficiency resulted in lower production waste and
      supported improvement in key environmental performance indicators
      direct carbon dioxide emissions per gross ton dropped by 162 including
      indirect emissions the decline was 78
      overall emissions to air continued on a fiveyear declining trend
      total water intake fell by 41
all ahlstrom plants work with local regional and federal authorities to regulate
and monitor emissions agreedupon limits are monitored and amended to
maintain compliance and protect the communities and moreover the world we
call home

air
absolute emissions of carbon dioxide co2 nitrogen oxides nox and sulfur
dioxide so2 continued on a downward fiveyear trend in 2016 direct
co2 emissions scope 1 totaled 267343 tons showing a significant drop of 154
from 316029 tons in 2015 the decrease was mainly because of lower
consumption of electricity and process heat and a cleaner burning mix of fuels
more natural gas and less oil coal and secondary fuels more details on energy
consumption and efficiency are available in the respective section co2 intensity
fell by 162 to 641 kg per gross ton from 765 kg per gross ton in the comparison
period co2 emissions including energy purchases scope 12 also fell
remarkably from the previous year as show in the chart below
in 2016 nitrogen oxides emissions were 250 tons up from 230 tons in the
comparison period this still represents a reduction of more than 25 since 2012
sulfur dioxide emissions in 2016 were 96 tons up from 65 tons in 2015 however
this constitutes a 15 reduction compared to 2012

waste to landfill
waste to landfill is a measured key process indicator kpi and is reported at
several levels each month ahlstroms stated longterm goal is zero waste to
landfill sixteen of our 28 sites have already achieved this goal while other sites
still work to identify and develop alternatives in 2016 waste to landfill from our
manufacturing facilities remained virtually unchanged at 102 kgton however
the fiveyear trend solidly reflects the progress and commitment to this endeavor

water used in plant production is reported monthly as a kpi m3ton plants work
to identify usage reductions while maintaining product characteristics and purity
in product requirements specific water consumption per gross ton decreased by
50 as capacity utilization rates increased at the sites where ahlstrom has made
investments in the recent years all plants operated in compliance with their
discharge permit range higher pollutant loads in effluents in 2016 were related to
water treatment process problems at several sites

health and safety
ahlstroms safety performance slipped in 2016 the accident frequency rate
afr  defined as number of lost time accidents per million man hours  rose to
46 compared to 27 in 2015 among the 31 reporting sites there were 50 total
recordable accidents tri in 2016 compared to 42 in 2015
however the cumulative numbers do not give a comprehensive picture of safety
performance within the group five reporting sites account for 50 of reported
recordable accidents three of the five sites also struggled in 2015 nineteen
plants had one or zero accidents
the americas region saw a severe decline in safety performance in 2016 there
were 22 recordable accidents compared to 11 recordable accidents in 2015
the primary focus in 2016 was implementation of behavioral based safety
practices beyond training and introductory launches in numerous plants the
challenge was to achieve broadbased participation to actively audit and discuss
working methods and observations
a new tool was added to support plants and identify hse issues risk
assessments were performed at eight sites by an outside auditor risk
assessments identify and rank hazards to assist in prioritizing corrective actions
and resources

report profile and materiality
ahlstroms annual report for the calendar year 2016 is published in an electronic
form on the companys website the entire report or sections of it can be
downloaded into a pdf form
as in our previous annual report published in february 2016 sustainability is
embedded to the publication in an integrated approach and we do not publish a
standalone sustainability report based on our own assessment the reporting
follows the global reporting initiatives gri g4 guidelines at core level the
report also reflects some principles set out in the international integrated
reporting ir framework
the financials section includes audited consolidated financial statements and
the report of operations for the year 2016 the governance section includes our
corporate governance statement and remuneration statement for 2016

control including all subsidiaries the operations in osnabr√ºck which were sold
in early 2017 are included in the figures except for water consumption in the
balance sheet the unit is presented under the line assets held for salethere were
no major restatements of information compared to the 2015 report there are
also no major changes in the material aspects or boundaries
in 2016 our reporting related to gri guidelines was not assured by a third party
as per top management decision however as our certification table available on
our website shows our plants are subject to multiple audits by third parties every
year in addition we have a wellfunctioning internal hse audit system and our
sites are also subject to many customer audits for the qualification of our
products
data collection for our material balance headcount and internal controls were
carried out centrally by the groups sourcing operations human resources and
legal functions consolidated financial statements were prepared by the groups

conducted in 2014 were still considered material within and outside the

capacity optimizing product quality improving its rd operations and market
monitoring as well as business intelligence to mitigate the risk the company is
also improving waste and recipe cost management which is expected to result in
cost savings the company is also continually seeking for more longterm
contracts with the customers

adoption of sms spunbondmeltblowspunbond technology in the companys
specialties business area as opposed to wetlaid technology to keep up with the
competition the company has redesigned its product portfolio and lowered the
cost structure of its existing products and has made investments in sms
technology

2016 ahlstrom has continued to mitigate the risk by investing in production
capacity the company has also developed its shortterm supply planning

shortage of supply for the companys key raw materials can result in a situation
where the company is temporarily not fully able to meet customer demand the
risk is managed by continually developing alternative product recipes searching
for new suppliers and by negotiating annual delivery contracts with suppliers
additionally changes in production processes have been made to ease up
shifting from one raw material supplier to another in case needed
attracting highly skilled personnel is important especially in rd sales and
marketing potential lack of competences in these areas can cause uncertainty in
reaching set growth targets the risk is mitigated by the annual human capital
review process the process comprises annual individual performance
assessment and assessment of risk of key personnel leaving the company also a
branding campaign to increase ahlstroms attractiveness as an employer is
continued
unpredictable political environment in the companys operating countries is
considered an important risk eg uncertainty in future us trade policies and the
united kingdom potentially leaving the european union as a result of midyear
referendum are among potential risk factors unstable economic situation in
brazil and argentina could also cause negative effects on the groups operations
political events and trade sanctions can affect the company directly and
indirectly while these events are outside of the companys influence mitigation
measures for potential effects include eg active demand planning and flexible
operations the company actively monitors political atmosphere in its operating
countries and strives to prepare well in advance for any potential negative
political changes and risks also a tracking system with the aim of preventing

outlook for 2017
ahlstrom does not provide an outlook for the year 2017 due to the planned
merger with munksj√∂ which is expected to be completed at the beginning of the
second quarter of 2017

shortterm risks
the economic outlook varies geographically growth in the us is expected to be
the highest among developed economies while that in europe is expected to
continue growing at a moderate pace britains decision to leave the european
union as well as swings in political tendencies across several nations has
increased uncertainty chinas expected shift in its economic structure towards
more consumer consumption and less investment has caused some concerns
but it can also provide opportunities
slowerthananticipated economic growth poses risks for ahlstroms financial
performance it may lead to lower sales volumes and force the company to
initiate marketrelated shutdowns at plants which could affect profitability
tougher competition through competitors increased production capacity
aggressive pricing as well as the adoption of new technologies may also affect
profitability shifts in the pattern of demand for the companys products may
strain the flexibility of its asset base and leave some assets underutilized while
others may become overloaded
swings in currency exchange rates may lead to fluctuations in net sales and
profitability ahlstroms main raw materials are wood pulp synthetic fibers and
chemicals the prices of these key raw materials are volatile and any increases
may affect the companys profitability depending on its ability to mitigate the risk

in some of the group companies income tax returns are under examination in tax
audits or have been already disputed by the tax authorities the main items under
discussion or already disputed relate to transfer pricing and restructuring issues
based on an evaluation of the current state of these processes no significant tax
provisions have been booked
ahlstrom and munksj√∂ have announced a plan to merge in 2017 the process
may cause loss of business focus at ahlstrom and the loss of skilled personnel
and knowhow

impairment annually whether there is any indication of impairment or not
the need for impairment is reviewed at the level of cashgenerating unit in other
words on the lowest unit level which is mainly independent of other units
the recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell or
value in use the value in use represents the discounted future cash flows
expected to be derived from an asset of a cashgenerating unit the discount rate
used is a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value
of money and the specific risk to the asset for which the future cash flow
estimates have not been adjusted
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds
its recoverable amount an impairment loss is immediately recognized in the
income statement and allocated first to reduce the goodwill of the cash
generating unit and thereafter to reduce the other assets of the unit an
impairment loss allocated to assets other than goodwill can be reversed in case a
positive change has taken place in the recoverable amount of an asset an
impairment loss is only reversed to the extent that the assets carrying amount
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of
depreciation or amortization had no impairment loss been recognized in prior

employee benefits
defined contribution and defined benefit plans
group companies have various pension schemes in accordance with local
practices in different countries the pension arrangements are classified as either
defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans the schemes are mostly
funded through payments to insurance companies or trusteeadministered funds
according to local regulations a defined contribution plan is a pension plan under
which the company and usually also the employees pay fixed contributions to an
insurance company the group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay
further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay the
pension benefits to the employees contributions to defined contribution pension
plans are recognized as expense in the period when they incur all pension plans
which do not meet the criteria for defined contribution plans are defined benefit
plans defined benefit plans typically define a fixed amount of benefit that an
employee will receive after retirement and which the company is responsible for
the groups net obligation of defined benefit plans is calculated and recorded
separately for each pension scheme based on calculations prepared by
independent actuaries the present value of defined benefit obligations is
determined using the projected unit credit method the net liability recognized in
the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end
of the reporting period less the fair value of the plan assets the discount rate
used to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation is equal to
the yield on high quality corporate bonds or if not available government bonds
the interest rates of the high quality corporate bonds are determined in the
currency in which the benefits will be paid with a similar maturity to the
obligation
the group adopted the revised ias 19 employee benefits standard as of january
1 2013 the revised standard includes amendments to the recognition of defined
benefit plans the corridor method has been removed and all actuarial gains
and losses are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income the net

based compensation occurs and to the equity the portion to be paid in cash is
recognized in personnel expenses and as debt

provisions

obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that a cash outflow will be
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be
made longterm provisions are discounted to their present value
a provision for restructuring is recognized only when a formal plan has been
approved and the implementation of the plan has either commenced or the plan
has been announced an environmental provision is recorded based on the
interpretations of environmental laws and the groups environment principles
when it is probable that an obligation has arisen and the amount of obligation can
be reliably estimated

derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
the group uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency
interest rate and commodity risks derivative financial instruments are initially
recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured at their fair value the method of recognizing the
resulting gains or losses is dependent on the intended use of the derivative in
question changes in fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying for hedge
accounting and which are effective are recognized congruently with the hedged
item when derivative contracts are entered into the group designates them
either as hedges of the fair value of recognized assets liabilities or firm
commitments fair value hedge hedges of forecasted transactions or firm
commitments cash flow hedge hedges of net investments in foreign operations
net investment hedge or as derivative financial instruments not meeting the
hedge accounting criteria
for hedge accounting purposes the group prepares documentation of the
hedged item the risk being hedged and the risk management objective and
strategy the group also documents its assessment both at hedge inception and
on an ongoing basis as to whether the derivatives used as hedging instruments
are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair
value hedges are recorded in the income statement together with any changes in
the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities attributable to the hedged risk
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under hedge accounting is recorded
in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income and presented as
hedging reserve in equity the cumulative gain or loss of a derivative deferred in
equity is recognized in the income statement in the same period in which the
hedged item affects profit or loss when hedging the foreign currency risk of
forecasted net sales and purchases or commodity risk the fair value of the
derivatives is recognized in the cost of goods sold in the income statement when
a hedging instrument expires is sold or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting
any cumulative gain or loss reflected in equity at that time remains in equity until

transaction is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gain or loss reported in
equity is recognized in the income statement

hedge its currency exposure of net investments in foreign operations which are
accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges the effective portion of the change in
fair value of the hedging instrument being the change in spot value and in
currency forwards the interest element after taxes are recorded in the
consolidated statement of other comprehensive income and presented as
translation reserve in equity any recognised ineffectiveness is presented in
financial gains and losses when the subsidiary is disposed or sold the
cumulative amount in the translation reserve is recognized in the income
statement as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the disposal

even if they are economic hedges according to the group treasury policy the
embedded derivatives which meet the terms and conditions defined in ias 39
standard will be separated from the host contract and measured at fair value
through profit or loss fair values are determined by utilizing public price
quotations and generally accepted valuation methods the valuation data and
assumptions are based on verifiable market prices

critical accounting estimates and assumptions
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with ifrs
requires management to use accounting estimates and assumptions in applying
the accounting principles the estimates are based on the managements best
knowledge at the balance sheet date but the actual outcome may differ from the
estimates and assumptions used the most significant estimates are related to
the fair value calculations of business combinations the economic lives of
property plant and equipment pension benefits deferred taxes valuation of
provisions and impairment testing of goodwill
the group management exercises judgment in selecting and applying the
accounting principles particularly in cases where the existing ifrs standards
offer alternative recognition valuation or presentation methods the basis for the
estimates are described in greater detail in the accounting principles and later in
the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements

1 financial risk management
financial risk management is part of ahlstroms groupwide risk management activities targeted to
mitigate events which could affect negatively the achievement of the companys strategic and
operative goals the overall objective of financial risk management in ahlstrom is to have cost
effective funding in group companies as well as to protect the group from unfavorable changes in
the financial markets and thus help to secure profitability the principles and limits for financing
activities are defined in the group treasury policy approved by the board of directors and the
treasury activities are coordinated by group treasury

foreign currency risk
the group is exposed to currency risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations against its reporting
currency euro the management of foreign currency exposure is divided into two parts one
relating to foreign currency flows transaction exposure and the other relating to balance sheet
items denominated in foreign currency translation exposure
transaction risks arise from commercial and financerelated transactions and payments which are
denominated in a currency other than the units functional currency in 2016 approximately 45 of
ahlstroms net sales were denominated in euros approximately 42 in us dollars and 13 in
other currencies ahlstroms raw materials are generally purchased in us dollars and euros
foreign currency flows are hedged on a net exposure basis per currency of the respective group
company in accordance with the rules set in the group treasury policy the guideline for group
companies is to hedge 100 of the forecasted 3 month net foreign currency flows per currency
against the base currency of the respective company however hedging periods can be extended
up to 12 months when agreed with group treasury foreign currency forwards are used as hedging
instruments and these are generally booked through the income statement the currency risk
related to the foreign currency denominated loans and receivables is managed by group treasury
and the aim is a fully hedged position in accordance with the group treasury policy all internal
loans and deposits are denominated in the local currency of each group company whenever
economically possible
translation exposure consists mainly of net investments in foreign subsidiaries equity exposure
the group norm is to leave the equity exposure unhedged due to the longterm nature of the
investments however capital reductions are hedged as the equity risk becomes more shortterm
in nature on the balance sheet date the equity hedging ratio was 09 31122015 17

financial instruments foreign exchange risk sensitivity analysis according to ifrs 7
the analysis has been prepared on the basis that the proportion of financial instruments in foreign
currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at december 31
2016 the financial instruments affected by market risks include working capital items such as
trade and other receivables and payables borrowings deposits cash and cash equivalents and
derivative financial instruments forecasted cash flows are not part of the analysis
the following table shows how much the income statement and equity would be affected by a 10
strengthening of the foreign currency against the reporting currency euro in case of a 10
weakening of the foreign currency against the euro the effect would be the opposite effect on
equity is caused by foreign exchange forwards designated in cash flow hedge accounting

in december 2016 an impairment charge of eur 06 million eur 75 million in 2015 related to the
processing cgu in osnabruck plant was recorded in filtration  performance business area this
impacted property plant and equipment the osnabruck plant produces materials for
wallcoverings poster papers and release liners the change in goodwill was eur 06 million and was
due to the changes in currency rates due to the change in business structure in 2016 there is a
change in goodwill between two cashgenerating units advanced filtration and transportation
filtration compared to the year 2015
the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating units is based on value in use calculation
projected cash flows are used in the calculations the projected cash flows are based on ebitda
normal replacement investments and changes in operative working capital of the financial plans for
the four years period cash flows for further years are based to the terminal value which is
calculated by using the average of the planned four years and general growth rate of 06  and
indefinite economic life time the same pretax discount rate has been used to all cashgenerating
units in discounting the projected cash flows the discount rate wacc 80  is based on the
market view of the timevalue of money and on the specific risks related to the assets for which the
future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted specific risks related to cashgenerating units
are included in the financial plans of the units
a goodwill impairment test is performed twice a year the first test is carried out in connection with
the september closing and the second one in connection to december closing in addition to these
impairment tests are performed whenever there is an indication of impairment group business
areas are monitoring the impairment sensitivity every month and should the sensitivity indicates
impairment  a full test will be initiated
according to the management estimate there is no reasonable possibility of such a change in any
key assumptions that would lead to the additional impairment charges sensitivity analyses have
shown that 5 points increase in the discount rate or 20  decrease in ebitda would not lead to
the impairment in any cgu

deferred tax assets have been booked in those group companies where assumptions regarding the
utilization of tax assets have been changed or where there is no sufficient evidence of utilization of
current years loss

been already disputed by the tax authorities the main items under discussion relate to transfer
pricing and company restructuring matters based on the evaluation of the current state of these
processes no significant tax provisions have been booked because it is not possible to make a

we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our opinion

independence
we are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in
accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in finland and are
relevant to our audit and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements

our audit approach
overview
materiality

   overall group materiality  10 million

group scoping

   in addition to parent company our group scope consists of 11 subsidiaries in 7 countries for the group audit purposes
   specific key business process areas and specified account balances were included in group scope

key audit matters

   revenue recognition in correct period
   goodwill impairment test and impairment of property plant and equipment
   deferred tax assets
   defined benefit pension plan obligations



as part of designing our audit we determined materiality and assessed the risks
of material misstatement in the financial statements in particular we considered
where management made subjective judgements for example in respect of
significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and
considering future events that are inherently uncertain

materiality
the scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality an audit
is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are

                                                               262

                                                                                              annual report 2016


free from material misstatement misstatements may arise due to fraud or error
they are considered material if individually or in aggregate they could reasonably
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
the financial statements
based on our professional judgement we determined certain quantitative
thresholds for materiality including the overall group materiality for the
consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below these together
with qualitative considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit
and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the
effect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole
overall group materiality                     10 million
how we determined it                         materiality was calculated based on ahlstrom group total external net sales in the
                                             financial statement 2016 using 1 rule of thumb
rationale for the materiality                we applied total revenues as the benchmark because in our view it is the
benchmark applied                            benchmark against which the performance of the group is most commonly
                                             measured by users and is a generally accepted benchmark we chose 1 as a
                                             applied percentage share


how we tailored our group audit scope
we tailored the scope of our audit taking into account the structure of the
ahlstrom corporation  the accounting processes and controls and the industry
in which the group operates ahlstrom corporation operates in 22 countries
located in america emea and asia where in all regions it has all together 28
manufacturing plants and sales offices
we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at group
companies by us as the group engagement team or by auditors from other pwc
network firms operating under our instruction audits were performed in group
companies which are considered significant either because of their individual
financial significance or due to their specific nature covering the vast majority of
revenue assets and liabilities of the group we performed selected specified
procedures as well as analytical procedures to cover the remaining companies
by performing the procedures above at reporting components combined with
additional procedures at the group level we have obtained sufficient and

                                                               263

appropriate evidence regarding the financial information of the group as a whole
to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements

key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of
most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period
these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial
statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not
provide a separate opinion on these matters
as in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of
internal controls including among other matters consideration of whether there
was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to
fraud
key audit matter in the audit of the group                      how our audit addressed the key audit matter
revenue recognition in correct period
refer to note 5 in the financial statements                     we performed audit procedures in accordance with our
                                                                materiality connected with cutoff of revenue recognition
the groups revenues comprise sales of different innovative
high quality fiberbased materials which are used in eg       we obtained understood and evaluated managements
filters medical gowns and drapes diagnostics wallcovers     assessment around the revenue cutoff difference we tested
and beverage and food packaging net sales are the net of       relevant it systems related to revenue we performed
revenues from the sale of products adjusted by indirect         substantive testing covering the timing of revenue
taxes returns rebates discounts and other credits           recognition and we reconciled countryspecific findings to a
revenue from product sales is recognised when ownership         grouplevel summary
of goods and the material risk related to ownership have        our substantive test of revenue included
been transferred to the buyer or other responsible party
however in practice revenue is recognised in the system             testing a sample of transactions occurring within
whenever goods leave the plants regardless of the specific           proximity of the financial yearend
incoterms in order to ensure correct revenue cutoff at             testing journal entries posted to revenue on a sample
year end an exception report is prepared in every country           basis
which provides details of sales recorded in the period and          testing revenue related balances recognised in the
for which risk and rewards of ownership have not yet been            balance
transferred these country specific reports are compiled
into one report at group level for group management s          based on the procedures performed we were able to assess
assessment as to whether a top side entry at group level is     management analysis and conclusion not to book a top side
required to in order adjust the revenue recognised at the       entry to adjust the revenue at year end
year end the automatic revenue recognition and manual
correction introduce a risk that not all erroneously
recognised revenue is recognized detected and corrected




                                                               264

due to the abovementioned risk factors we consider
