review by the chairman of the board of
directors
dear pohjola shareholders

2012 was a good year for the entire oppohjola group in terms of both growth and financial performance pohjola
accounted for a significant share of oppohjola groups financial performance pohjolas banking improved its earnings
over the previous year despite the challenging operating environment and low interest rates in the meanwhile the
favourable investment environment boosted the financial performance of nonlife insurance and asset management in
addition banking and nonlife insurance businesses continued their integration success story

growth in corporate banking proved once again that we bear responsibility for economic growth in finland in more
difficult times too pohjola plays a major role in this respect

the operating environment will remain unstable in particular the burden of the new regulatory environment and
decisions on taxation will affect profit performance in the financial sector nevertheless we at pohjola are well prepared
for these challenges we have strong financial buffers the reorganisation programme launched last year will
substantially slow growth in expenses in 2013 and in the next few years

one of the key points in our updated strategy is to continue to adhere to the stable dividend policy

president and ceos review
for pohjola 2012 was a year of success and a record year in many respects although our operating environment was
characterised by uncertainty the european sovereign debt crisis still persists and the weakerthanexpected economic
growth has dampened corporate capital spending last year was a period of growth for pohjola we made progress in
our business at operational level in line with our expectations and made headway according to our strategy

with a favourable investment environment we also did an excellent job in investment operations restored investor
confidence in capital markets was supported by the ecbs announcement to buy the sovereign bonds of crisisridden
countries in secondary markets

our consolidated earnings before tax amounted to eur 374 million and at fair value to almost eur 800 million

we made progress in all of our business lines banking reported the best performance for the second year in a row we
continued to increase our market share of corporate loans our firm and calculated choice to stand by finnish companies
through thick and thin and support their growth and business development lie behind this increase in our market share
we still boast a good quality loan portfolio our good progress is also shown by the fact that deposits increased by up to
92 we achieved numberone position as an arranger of syndicated loans and bonds in finland a smooth start of
government payment transfers for which we act as the primary intermediary as a result of competitive tendering and a
new corporate branch office opened in latvia number among our successful accomplishments

nonlife insurance reported strong growth in insurance premium revenues we have recruited heavily for policy sales
and last year we broke sales records among both private and corporate customers successful crossselling with op
pohjola group cooperative banks increased the number of loyal customer households by a record of around 47000 to
almost 570000 despite the large volume growth the quality of our claims service remained good nonlife insurance
recorded a good operating combined ratio although it was saddled with larger claims than a year earlier opening
omasairaala oy a hospital for outpatient surgery specialising in orthopaedic diseases and injuries in early 2013 will
ensure comprehensive customer service all the way from personal injury until recovery

our asset management too reported record earnings and improved investment returns considerably intensified
cooperation within oppohjola group was reflected for example in better customer satisfaction among major internal
customers

last year was also characterised by the information and consultation of employees process related to the reorganisation
programme initiated within oppohjola group central cooperative consolidated as a result the number of our
employees will reduce considerably although this process was painful for our personnel it was necessary because the
reorganisation will enable significant improvements in the groups costefficiency this is how we will ensure our
competitiveness and service capabilities in the future too

last autumn we published our updated strategy its theme being entitled value and efficiency through integration the
updated strategy highlights the following seeking more targeted growth in order to improve the return on capital
especially in banking and increasing capital adequacy ratios enhancing group efficiency and keeping costs at the 2012
level for the next three years also play an important part of our strategy we have placed customer experience at the
core of our operations with the aim of exceeding customer expectations making more efficient use of oppohjola
groups competitive advantages and strengths also play an important role in the strategy

2012 was a good year in terms of financial performance sales and customer relationships the group had a strong
liquidity and capital base at the end of the year accordingly the board of directors will propose to the annual general
meeting that a dividend of 046 euros be paid per listed series a share and 043 euros per unlisted series k share this
proposal corresponds to a 51 dividend payout ratio

i look ahead to 2013 with confidence we may see a gradual recovery of the euroarea economy from recession towards
the year end confidence indicators are already suggesting such a revival we expect our earnings before tax to be higher
in 2013 than in 2012 we have a solid foundation for such an earnings improvement we now have a stronger market
position than ever before and have made decisions that have provided us with a basis for greater operational efficiency


pohjola bank plc

i should like to take this opportunity to express my warmest thanks to our shareholders and customers for their trust
and oppohjola group cooperative banks and other partners for their constructive cooperation i also wish to express my
gratitude and thanks to our employees who did an excellent job last year during the sometimes tough moments

operating environment
global economic growth slowed down in 2012 showing a slower growth rate than the last decades average economic
development was characterised by great uncertainty and was uneven the us economy grew at a moderate pace and
employment improved whereas the euro area headed for a mild recession

the european sovereign debt crisis continued to weigh on financial markets in the early summer uncertainties mounted
as a result of greeces parliamentary elections during the second half the greatest worries about the crisis faded after
the european central bank ecb announced its government bondpurchase programme

the ecb cut its key interest rate to 075 and in the first half increased market liquidity significantly through its
extraordinary longterm refinancing operations market interest rates fell to record low during 2012

economic growth in finland remained weak in 2012 following the favourable first quarter economic growth faded
towards the year end economic growth was supported by consumer spending whereas exports and capital spending
were subdued the slower economic growth made unemployment increase during the second half of the year home
prices rose by a few per cent but home sales and residential building decreased slightly

the global economic growth outlook for 2013 is still weaker than on average economic growth in the euro area will
remain weak the finnish economy will at its best grow slowly the ecb will keep its key interest rate low and if
required take extraordinary measures to support financial stability euribor rates will remain record low

last year total loans in the finnish banking sector increased by 7 which was markedly above the average growth rate
in the euro area loans to households continued their relatively steady growth supported by lower market rates
whereas demand for corporate loans subsided in the second half as a result of the weaker economic outlook growth
prospects on total loans for 2013 are dimmer than last year

as a result of favourable developments in financial markets mutual fund and insurance assets grew during the second
half of 2012 stock prices in finland rose by an average of around 10 in 2012 mutual funds net asset inflows
increased the growth rate of deposits slowed down slightly towards the year end as a result of a decline in market
interest rates and the restored risk appetite the yearend total deposits were 6 higher than the year before

the total premiums written by the nonlife insurance sector still grew at a steady annual rate of around 6 claims paid
increased by 4 which is a slower rate than previously this can be specifically attributed to the better weather

financial sector in the face of major
transformation
the financial sector is undergoing major transformation in many respects the authorities are considerably tightening
regulations on banks capital adequacy and liquidity for example the key regulatory changes of the basel iii reform for
financial institutions will impose more stringent capital adequacy requirements introduce new regulatory requirements
on bank leverage and involve increased regulation in the field of financial risk exposure moreover finland has adopted a
temporary bank tax since early 2013 the regulatory framework for insurance companies will also undergo changes
through solvency ii however uncertainties are still associated with the content and implementation schedule of these
international regulatory frameworks

todays low interestrate environment coupled with tighter regulation and a higher tax burden will increase profitability
pressures in the financial sector the outlook for low growth and concerns about the euroarea economy are still
reflected in prospects in the financial sector the sector is also currently undergoing structural changes it is developing
electronic services and reshaping distribution channels
