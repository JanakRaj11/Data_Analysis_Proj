      we are committed to ensure we deliver the best products to the customer in a socially responsible manner
                         whether it is in form of product quality and safety or responsible media

we are very focused on

      minor international aims to engage in endtoend customer experience

                                       beyond the normal customer interaction
                     we start to get involved in other aspects of customers experience with us
 for example sizzler promotes the allergen awareness in food served at our restaurants to increase our customers
                                        awareness and reduce food safety risk

minor food group initiated a program to include the emails to the brands
                                   customers can reach out to them when needed
                                we also make sure that we create responsible media
                when communicating to our customers without controversial or incorrect contents

                   3 committing to longterm  sustainable partnerships

                                     one of our core values is partnership
                         and we strive to develop winwin relationships with our partners
