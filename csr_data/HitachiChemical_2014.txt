       q 7 what progress have you made in the cost structure reforms
       along with growing our businesses we are reforming the                    and achieve an operating income margin of at least 10 to
       cost structure to ensure robust management our cost of                    achieve this we will reform all operational processes not only
       sales is currently 758 and we aim to improve that to 74                business divisions but also rd and administrative divisions
       by fiscal year 2015 similarly we plan to lower our sga ratio            such as human resources and finance
       from the current 186 to 16 within the same timeframe

liabilities by 582 million 5650 thousand and increase deferred income taxes by 582 million 5650 thousand as of and for the year
