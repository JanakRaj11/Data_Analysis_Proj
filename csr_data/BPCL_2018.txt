         5          key impacts risks and opportunities

     india has surpassed japan in the consumpon of primary energy and now stands as the 3rd largest consumer of energy in
     the world registering a growth of 55 in energy consumpon with plans on the west coast reﬁnery gaining momentum
     india is emerging as a reﬁning hub

     the declining trend in oil prices connued in 201617 this bodes well for the indian economy given the increased
     dependence on oil and petroleum products as a source of energy this year the indian crude basket has marginally
     increased to  4716 per barrel from  4617 per barrel in the previous year the increase is due to the depreciaon in the
     indian rupee the fall in prices has also kept the price of diesel under control contribung signiﬁcantly to ensuring healthy
     levels of inﬂaon further the subsidy burden for the central exchequer has reduced by 28 to rs 19728 crores as
     compared to the previous year with the oil psus being fully compensated for throughout the year

     while the decline in crude prices has reduced the prices of fuel in india and thus the subsidy burden perming the
     emergence of market determined prices based on established pricing models it has also encouraged the private players
     to perform more aggressively during 201617 private players gained a market share of more than 10

     renewable sources of energy are growing exponenally it is expected that half of the addional energy requirements will
     be met from renewable sources together with nuclear and hydroelectric power over the next 20 years this makes
     renewable sources of energy both an opportunity as well as a threat since it provides a plaorm to migrate towards
     cleaner and more eﬃcient forms of energy and a threat as it risks the obsolescence of huge investments in convenonal
     forms of energy but given the increasing compeveness of renewable and concerns over carbon emissions slowly but
     surely the fuel mix is undergoing a transion

     robust infrastructure is a fundamental requirement for any industry and more so in the oil  gas sector due to the
     hazardous nature of the product india has made several inroads in upstream has an impressive reﬁning capacity slated
     to increase has made signiﬁcant progress in storage especially with the strategic crude oil storage plans a strong
     distribuon network and reasonable road infrastructure to facilitate transportaon of products however there is an
     urgent need to enhance the import infrastructure especially for the import of lpg while a focused approach has been
     adopted to address this issue it will be a while before india will have a comprehensive import infrastructure

     demonezaon in november 2016 has set the stage for digitalizaon in the country this has been a signiﬁcant decision
     that was implemented by the government of india and has catapulted the country onto a digital plaorm with increasing
     number of digital transacons india is geng slowly but surely accustomed to a cashless mode of payment what remains
     a challenge is given the combusble nature of petroleum products how safely digital transacons can be completed in
     the petrol staons another challenge will be to ensure the endtoend security of these transacons

     another major step that is being taken by the indian government is that on gst which was eﬀecve from 1st july 2017
     the mulstage desnaonbased tax that will be levied on every value addion will impact the indian oil  gas industry
     in a unique manner as not all petroleum products are covered under gst this implies that there will be an incidence of
     nonrecovery of input tax credit thus resulng in an increased cash oulow the exact ﬁnancial impact can be ascertained
     and analyzed only when suﬃcient data is available and once more clarity emerges on how such nonrecoveries of input
     tax credit will be addressed

india is at the threshold of a major transion being one of the fastest growing economies in the world with a reasonable
growth in energy consumpon india is poised to take on the challenges of intensiﬁed growth in such an environment
bpcl is very well placed to contribute to the development of the naon other than all the naonal and internaonal
challenges faced by bpcl climate change is one of the main factors which is increasingly posing a number of risks any
physical asset under the inﬂuence of natural calamies as a result of climate change would be under impending danger
at bpcl as plants and equipments may not be able to withstand the unexpected climate change paerns that may follow
further bpcl has also classiﬁed risk associated with climate change in 4 diﬀerent categories namely physical risk
regulatory risk health risk and reputaon risk

     message from the director finance
                                         sustainable development of society and the naon is of paramount importance for us
                                         at bpcl our commitment to sustainable development is to go beyond compliance and
                                         meet the customer and stakeholder expectaons and parcipate in the overall
                                         development of the economy society and environment

                                         the oil and gas sector contributes a major share to the countrys gross domesc
                                         product gdp the ﬁnancial year 201617 has seen a growth of 52 in consumpon
                                         of petroleum products as compared to the 116 growth recorded in the previous year
                                         the main reason for a decline in growth was due to the substanal decline in the
                                         demand for diesel which constutes 40 of the total consumpon basket diesel grew
                                         by only about 2 during 201617 as compared to the 75 growth recorded in the
                                         previous year largely due to reducon in the growth in commercial vehicles cv the
                                         sharp decline in oil prices over the past couple of years has been extremely beneﬁcial
                                         to india making energy more aﬀordable and easily accessible for the consumers and
     complemenng the governments iniaves to improve the availability accessibility and aﬀordability of clean fuel together
     with reliability and selfsuﬃciency however the challenge of imports remains as india is sll dependent on imports for
     80 of its crude requirements thus making it more vulnerable to the internaonal oil scenario

     the government of india has taken a decision to implement daily price changes in petrol and diesel across the country a
     shi from a fortnightly restructuring of price aer the success of the pilot project in chandigarh udaipur jamshedpur
     puducherry and vishakhapatnam on 1st may 2017 the iniave has been rolled out across the country with eﬀect from
     16th june 2017 the change was made on the grounds of introducing internaonal standards in the indian fuel retail market
     besides avoiding wide ﬂuctuaons in rsp while ensuring complete transparency in petrol and diesel pricing while the basis
     of pricing shall connue to be on internaonal oil rates the only change is the reﬂecon of daily internaonal prices in the
     petrol and diesel prices in india it is expected that companies and consumers both shall beneﬁt from this move in order
     to ensure that the customers are well informed about the prices several modes of communicaon such as mobile apps
     automaon at petrol pumps led screens at petrol pumps sms facility and updaon of retail selling prices in the oil psu
     websites are being used

     another major transformaon in the tax regulaons witnessed by the country recently is the implementaon of goods and
     services tax gst with eﬀect from 01st july 2017 the mulstage desnaonbased tax that will be levied on every value
     addion will impact the indian oil  gas industry in a unique manner as not all petroleum products are covered under gst
     consequently there will be an increase in the tax burden due to nonavailability of input tax credits

    solar pv system installed at pithampur lpg plant

    pithampur lpg plant has a solar pv system of capacity of 9 kw for the purpose of powering the admin
    building the system is a rooop grid type one without baeries so the power produced by the solar pv
    system is directly taken into the lt panel the power of the solar pv system is preferenally used ﬁrst if
    the power generated by the system is not enough then only power from the ht side is taken if power
    generated by the solar pv system is under  ulized then the balance power passes onto the mldb panel
    and the balance power is then used up by other equipment in the panel as the plant operates in double
    shi and maximum power of the admin building is ulized in between 0830 am and 530 pm this method
    is eﬀecve it also reduces the cost of baery maintenance

    the solar pv system was successfully commissioned by 31st january 2016

     inauguration of rain water harvesting system at
     mumbai reﬁnery sports club
     the objecve of this project is to collect surface runoﬀ rain water from bpcl reﬁnery sports club ground
     and use the same as makeup water requirement of ccr raw water cooling tower inside the reﬁnery

     rain water falling on ground being collected through a system of exisng and newly constructed storm
     water channels running around the periphery of the ground underground precast modular ﬁltraon
     system furaat has been provided to ﬁlter surface runoﬀ water the ﬁltered rain water is channelized by
     common header of 160 mm dia hdpe pipe to 250 cum ug rcc tank

     in order to bring water from sports club to reﬁnery busy ghatkopar mahul road was cut for laying the 3
     dia pipeline with sleeve special permission from statutory authority like mcgm  rto was obtained the
     job was completed within the spulated period 3 days and with least inconvenience to the general public
     the reﬁnery sports club ground having catchment area of 25170 sqmt and rain water harvesng poten
     al of 53289 cu mt per year project cost is 17 crore

    roorkee lpg bottling plant
    solar plant
    a 10 kw solar power plant was installed on the roof of admin building aer the installaon of this the
    kwmt of the plant has reducedin this type of solar plants grid connected solar pv systems feeds solar
    energy directly into the building loads without baery storage in case of short fall if any solar energy is
    imported from the grid the solar pv modules are of crystalline silicon type manufactured in india

    thus bpcl can save approx 90 of power consumed by our admin building by installaon of 10 kw on grid
    connected solar power plant without baery on the roof of admin building of roorkee lpg boling plant

    rain water harvesng system
    water is our most precious natural resource and something that most of us take for granted we are now
    increasingly becoming aware of the importance of water to our survival and its limited supply the
    harvesng of rainwater simply involves the collecon of water from surfaces on which rain falls and
    subsequently storing this water for later use at roorkee we have installed rain water harvesng facilies at
    three locaons one unit is installed near admin building one unit near lpg pump  compressor shed and
    one in green belt area all these rain water harvesng units are being used to increase the level of the ground
    water




8aiii biodiversity
bpcl is strategically reviewing its impact on biodiversity in its areas of operaon bpcl has iniated the process of
creang awareness on the importance of biodiversity among various locaons bpcl has iniated the idenﬁcaon of
protected areas and potenal areas of high biodiversity value near all its industrial units in india an environmental
impact assessment is done for all new projects to idenfy the impact of operaons on ﬂora and fauna bpcl has begun
sensizing employees on the issues of biodiversity with the help of informave note on biodiversity the details of the
roles in protecng the biodiversity will be reported in 201718

bpcl is conducng tree plantaon drives throughout various locaons and also invesng me and eﬀort in preserving the
green belt the tree plantaon drive is usually carried out on occasions such as earthenvironment day saplings are
planted and even distributed under the csr iniave of bpcl further on this secon is discussed under community

     8aiv emissions management
     the energy and climate policies present major challenges to the oil and gas industry the government holds primary
     responsibility to contribute to securing the energy supply with respect to the growing energy demand

     bpcl is taking steps towards enhancing energy eﬃcient technologies in their operaons this would reduce ghg
     emissions and in turn migate climate change and global warming bpcls emissions from operaons include carbon
     dioxide nox sox methane and other gases

     to reduce environmental impact bpcl has set periodic targets at all locaons systems and system upgradaons are
     made to measure the quantum of emissions bpcl is progressing towards zero ozone depleng substance ods

9a investor interests
investors are the most important stakeholders inﬂuencing decision making in the company a sustainable return requires
sharper focus on corporate governance and environmental and social factors and owing to the nature of the sector the
business is chieﬂy driven by consumer spending ﬂuctuaon in crude oil prices strong government and a ﬁscally prudent
budgetary plan inﬂuenced by eﬃcient and quality proucts derived by environmentally safe pracces bpcl has been
strategically expanding its investment in reﬁning and distribuon capacity to bridge the gap between sales volumes and
producon and create oportunies with the manufacture of nice petrochemicals

indian petroleum sector
india is expected to overtake china as the largest consumer of petroleum products over the next 20 yearswhile oil
dynamics are expected to connue to remain uncertain and volale the oil industry is well on the recovery path geng
accustomed to the new lows the decline in prices has been extremely beneﬁcial to india making energy more
aﬀordable and easily accessible what remains a challenge though is that india is sll dependent on imports for 80 of
its crude requirements thus making it more vulnerable to the internaonal oil scenario india accounts for only 03 of
the proven oil reserves but has an energy consumpon share exceeding 5 in such a situaon being one of the fastest
growing energy consumers crude import decisions become extremely crucial

over the years indias crude imports have been increasing consistently during 201617 crude imports increased 5
over the previous year however declining prices have had a posive impact on the crude import bill it was only last year
that the energy bill has increased by about 10 parally due to moderate increase in crude prices and parally due to
the depreciang indian rupee

     on 1st april 2017 up from 2301 mmt in the previous year the increase in reﬁning capacity is aributable to the integrat

     6 mmtpa from 201819 onwards 80 of designed capacity has been included at present psu companies connue to hold

     over the years crude processing in india has been increasing during 201617 it has increased by more than 5 to 2454
     mmt as compared to the previous year the increase is primarily due to the commissioning of the paradip reﬁnery in
     february 2016 and is expected to grow further with the irep stabilizaon of bpcls kochi reﬁnery consumpon of
     petroleum products grew by 52 to 1942 mmt during 201617 as compared to the 116 growth recorded in the

     constutes 40 of the total consumpon basket diesel grew by only about 2 during 201617 as compared to the 75
     growth recorded in the previous year largely due to reducon in the growth in commercial vehicles cv during 201617
     cvs registered a growth of about 4 as against the growth of 115 on the previous year this together with increased
     fuel eﬃciency have caused a sharp reducon in the growth of diesel during 201617

annexure 2 ghg calculation quantiﬁcation methodology
the methodology of calculaon of ghg emissions from bpcl operang locaons are aligned with the
following standard deﬁnions

1 staonary combuson emission factors provided in the ipcc guideline for naonal greenhouse gas
inventories of 2006 were used to calculate ghg emissions from staonary combuson sources acvity data
quanty of fuel consumed is mulplied with the respecve default energy factor or actual measured net
caloriﬁc value ncvs and emission factor to quanfy the direct emission from staonary combuson sources
2 purchased electricity the quanﬁcaon of energy indirect ghg emission scope 2 is based on acvity
data purchased electricity in kwh mulplied by emission factors speciﬁed in the co2 baseline database for
the indian power sector user guide issued by central electricity authority government of india for uniﬁed
grid
3 transportaon only transportaon considered for calculaon of emissions is inplant vehicular movement
of the vehicles emission factors provided in the ipcc guideline for naonal greenhouse gas inventories of
2006 were used to calculate ghg emissions from combuson sources acvity data quanty of fuel
consumedis mulplied with the respecve default energy factor or actual measured net caloriﬁc value
ncvs and emission factor to quanfy the emissions
