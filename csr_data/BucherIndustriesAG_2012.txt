interchange with a variety of stakeholder groups foremost among these  in addition
to the employees and management  are endusers dealers and suppliers other important
groups are the shareholders financial institutions investors analysts media representa

communities are also stakeholders within the divisions and individual companies internal
communication is a top priority here too competence trust and reliability are what count

            this report is based on environmental data gathered for the first time from         in 2011 the bucher
across the entire group and standardised all important production sites in all divisions      group invested
of the bucher group were included a total of 29 facilities the focus of the survey was on
the energy data  and therefore implicitly on greenhouse gas emissions  as well as water
                                                                                               chf 118 million in the
consumption for the first time the results of this survey provide the bucher group           modernisation of its
with the basis for a greenhouse gas inventory modelled on the greenhouse gas protocol         production plants
ghg protocol a corporate accounting and reporting standard revised edition2006
and the iso 14064 standard

            production
            in view of the challenges of climate change and the rising price of energy and
 raw materials one of bucher primary goals is to reduce consumption of energy and materials
 and cut emissions of greenhouse gases co²e responsible use of water resources and
reduction of solvent consumption are both targets of the groups environmental policies

             kuhn group all kuhn group companies are working towards making their
products and business activities more sustainable in terms of use of resources and protec
tion of the environment many environmental aspects are taken into account in new in
vestments liquid varnishing is increasingly being replaced by powder coating this process
requires no binders or solvents and no volatile organic compounds vocs are emitted
             other examples include a plant in north america which has replaced more
than 660 metal vapour lamps with fluorescent tubes saving more than 105 000 kwh of
electricity every year while another operation has equipped its forklift trucks with remote
control for opening doors keeping the time of opening to a minimum and resulting in
a significant reduction in heat loss during the winter months

            bucher municipal bucher municipal operates two manufacturing sites
which are iso 14001 certified and is planning to extend this certification to other sites
bucher municipal is already going a step further and moving towards dealing more with
suppliers who are iso 14001 certified employees receive corresponding training
            the production site in great britain is already implementing a range of measures
to save energy an intelligent energy management system was installed in the factories
to control the thermostat settings and timers the annual reduction in energy usage
brings cost savings equivalent to chf 25 000 installation of automatic motion sensors to
control the lighting achieved a further reduction in electricity usage

              bucher hydraulics bucher hydraulics is committed to sustainable environ
mentally compatible production two of its sites  in italy and switzerland  are iso 14001
certified in switzerland and germany three new buildings were constructed to the highest
standards of energy efficiency one of the sites with more than 6 000 m² of production
space in frutigen switzerland is certified in accordance with the rigorous minergie
standard this new construction was the first factory building of this size in canton bern
to be awarded minergie certification the example shows how the energy consumption
for indoor heating can be reduced despite an increase in floor space during the reporting
year by recovering process heat from the hydraulic test stands and machine tools
a further 20 000 litres of heating oil is saved annually

  ble use of resources                 unlike traditional techniques 80 of the soil is untouched this process saves time and
                                        fuel retains water in the soil and reduces soil erosion furthermore each seed row is dried
                                        slightly and warmed which facilitates sowing and accelerates plant growth soil composition
                                        is loosened without the farmer needing to plough deep furrows organic matter on the
                                        ground between the furrows remains intact and weeds are curbed reducing the amount

                                                     the process has proved particularly valuable on very stony and loamy soils in
                                        france the number of passes needed to complete the tilling operation is reduced from
                                        five to two on sandy soils in areas of high precipitation for example in eastern germany
                                        water and organic matter is retained in the soil providing good planting conditions

             bucher hydraulics has launched the ecodraulics initiative for its products 
predating the similar blue competence initiative started by the vdma in germany
all ecodraulics products are subjected to an internal evaluation process and awarded the
classification only if they offer a proven benefit in addition to energy conservation
significant criteria are sustainable use of resources lower emissions and optimised
 manufacturing processes using waste heat for warming buildings

                 emhart glass used as packaging glass containers are fully recyclable
e nabling a closed material cycle emhart glass was the first manufacturer worldwide to
 succeed in bringing tempering as used in plate glass production to glass packaging
  products this patentprotected process allows the glass to be made either significantly
   stronger or lighter  up to 20 the weight of returnable bottles can be reduced significantly
   without compromising the filling capacity  a big advantage for logistics and recycling
the process is being commercialised in cooperation with the vetropack company
                 another innovation is the servoelectric bis machine which underwent suc
cessful testing at the emhart glass research centre in the usa during the reporting year
by systematically using servoelectric drives emhart glass is continuing the industry trend
to replace pneumatic with electrical drives to power this machine this contributes to the
reduction of energy consumption and to lower noise emissions on the other hand the
high repetition accuracy of servoelectric drives improves the stability of the production
process resulting in greater efficiency

                                        other case the employee was ordered to withdraw from the conflict situation our conclusion

applying sustainability criteria to the selection of suppliers throughout the group
