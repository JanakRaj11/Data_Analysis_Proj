editors note
it has been a quick five months since organizing our report team
in april when preparing the report we involved the various com
pany divisions and group companies in selecting report content
and also made an effort to incorporate outside perspectives by
conversing with external experts this fiscal year we took on the
new challenge of preparing report content with an increased
awareness of overseas stakeholders going forward we will in
tensify csr initiatives on a groupwide and global level and also
continue to advance efforts to disclose nonfinancial information
with a high degree of transparency
