nei investments
a message from
our ceo
we are pleased to present our first corporate social
responsibility report

at nei investments we believe
sustainability touches on every aspect of
our work  and that we can integrate the concept of
sustainability across everything we do this is the basis
for our corporate social responsibility csr  approach


during 2009 we developed a companywide csr policy
based on six commitments
 1 pursue the highest ethical standards in the ways we do business
 2 demonstrate leadership in responsible investing
 3 minimize the environmental and social footprint of our operations and supply chain
 4 strive to be competitive with employers in our industry and to have
    a highlyengaged workforce
 5 identify and engage with our stakeholders
 6 contribute to the community


like many financial services companies our direct operational footprint is relatively small by far our
biggest opportunity for impact is through the investment decisions we make and our influence on the
companies held within our funds we will continue to be a catalyst for positive change through our
proactive program of corporate engagement
our csr policy defines our sustainability priorities but it is not enough to commit ourselves to action
and continuous improvement we must also report on the results this first csr report is a baseline
as we develop an understanding of our impacts we will set targets for improvement and disclosure
we hope you will accompany us on our sustainability reporting journey

     3 minimize the environmental and social footprint of our operations
        and supply chain
     as an officebased financial services company our biggest direct environmental and social impacts relate
     to paper energy use and travel
     paper for our printed materials our paper  printing selection policy requires
     that we ask for recycled paper made from 100 postconsumer waste and sets
     30 as the minimum recycled content we give preference to forest stewardship
     council certified paper and seek out suppliers who use vegetablebased inks and
     sustainable energy sources to power their operations in 2009 we switched from
     quarterly to semiannual investor statements resulting in costsavings and an ap
     proximate 30 reduction in paper consumption
     energy use we estimate nei investments annual energy use at our van
     couver and toronto offices at 390 mwh this translates to approximately 52
     tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in 2009 we refreshed our it infrastructure
     including rightsizing our systems and equipment to reduce energy demand
     we also began to explore the possibility of purchasing bullfrog power sustain
     able energy certificates for our toronto and vancouver offices and implement
     ed this in early 2010
     travel in 2009 our employees drove 102838 km in private cars on com
     pany business producing estimated greenhouse gas ghg emissions of just
     over 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2010 we have set up an air
     travel tracking system that will allow us to calculate ghg emissions resulting
     from air travel these measurements provide a starting point as we explore
     opportunities to reduce and offset our travel emissions the vancouver office
     participated in two green commuting initiatives in 2009 the commuter
     challenge and bike to work week


     4 strive to be competitive with employers in our industry
        and have a highlyengaged workforce
     in a knowledgebased industry our people are our biggest resource in 2009 nei investments hired
     a human resources manager tasked with ensuring that we remain competitive as an employer
     we offer our employees a competitive package of compensation and benefits including extended
     medical and dental insurance disability and life insurance family assistance programs and fitness subsidies
     we want our employees to develop professionally and provide education reimbursements for jobrelated
     training and education
     regrettably 2009 saw higherthanusual staff turnover through layoffs partly as a result of the integration
     of our operations postmerger and partly as a result of costcutting in response to the downturn created
     by the global financial crisis
