sponda
sponda plc is a real estate investment company that specialises in business premises in the helsinki metropolitan area and tampere spondas
business concept is to own lease and develop office retail and shopping centre properties into environments that promote the business success
of its clients


sponda is organised into three business units investment properties property development and russia




chief executives review
spondas core operations remained stable in 2014 the sales of properties during the year led to a slight yearonyear decline in total revenue
but cash flow remained strong


in the office market vacancy rates have increased particularly in helsinki and spondas occupancy rate also decreased slightly from the
previous year however spondas prime areas in the helsinki metropolitan area the central business district and ruoholahti in particular still
remain desired locations the shopping centre business continues to be hampered by low consumer confidence in the economy but there are
signs of a slight positive turn in spite of the difficult situation we managed to maintain the occupancy rate of our shopping centres at the previous
years level and even increase it slightly



property ownership focused on the helsinki metropolitan area and tampere

we continued to implement our strategy which was revised in 2013 we sold our shares in three real estate funds and approximately half of our
logistics property portfolio to certeum oy the transaction was significant not only to sponda but also the finnish property market


during the year we also sold most of our properties located in turku the transactions see us focus our property ownership even more strongly
on our key strategic areas namely the helsinki metropolitan area and tampere



development projects increase property quality

our property development operations were active in 2014 particularly in light of the prevailing economic situation the largest projects in 2014
were the new office properties under construction in helsinkis lassila and ilmala districts we also had major renovation investments underway
which will allow us to offer increasingly highquality business premises solutions to our customers increasing the quality of our property portfolio
improves our property stock and reduces its risk


two new construction projects and two extensive refurbishment projects will be completed in 2015 the preletting rates for the projects are high
and their completion will bring a valuable addition to spondas total revenue and property portfolio our aim is to start at least one new property
development project in 2015



changes in how work is done are challenging the property sector

there are many questions surrounding the future of the property industry changes in how work is done changing business premises
requirements and general trends in urban development are presenting new challenges to industry operators it is necessary to assess how
properties will be used in the future and what areas will see growth we must have an open mind and a broadbased approach to various
alternatives for example converting an old logistics property for residential use may be a sensible move for all concerned and promoting such
projects requires effective cooperation between parties such as businesses and the public administration

strategy sponda has a good property portfolio and the capacity to adapt business premises according to customer needs we also have a strong
capacity for change we want to not only develop properties but also develop sponda as a company

climate expert wants to dispel myths about energy
climate change cannot be stopped but it can and must be slowed down this is best achieved by improving energy efficiency and
cutting back on energy consumption the climate experts vision also includes a healthy dose of sun and wind


the ongoing climate change is the result of increased amounts of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere greenhouse gases act like the glass
roof of a greenhouse containing heat within the earths atmosphere when the amount of greenhouse gases increases the greenhouse effect is
intensified and the earths average temperature rises


 rising average temperature leads to an increase in extreme weather phenomena such as heavy rain and its opposite severe drought marine
ecosystems are threatened by rising water temperatures and the acidifying effect carbon dioxide has on the seas in finland winters will become
even gloomier due to increased cloudiness says hannaliisa kangas who worked as a climate coordinator at wwf finland until the turn of
the year and is currently a climate policy researcher at the finnish environment institute

controlling emissions from chimneys

the greenhouse gas with the most significant effect on rising temperatures is carbon dioxide which is primarily released into the atmosphere
from the chimneys of power plants that use fossil fuels


 for this reason energy conservation and energy efficiency play a central role in slowing down climate change buildings are real gluttons for
energy accounting for approximately 40 per cent of finlands total energy consumption reducing the energy consumption of buildings is
essential kangas says


the key avenues for achieving this include improving the energy efficiency of                      it is a myth that finland doesnt
properties which is best done by renovating properties to make them more energy
                                                                                                   get enough sun or wind
efficient and informing the users of properties about ways to save energy


 the lower the total consumption of energy the larger the share of our energy requirement that can be met by zeroemission and renewable
sources such as geothermal energy wind and solar power kangas explains


 it is a myth that finland doesnt get enough sun or wind in fact we are extremely well positioned to make more effective use of renewable
energy sources she adds



electric cars as energy storage units

in this climate experts future vision energy generated by solar and wind power would be stored in large quantities in storage units such as the
batteries of electric vehicles


 i believe electric cars can serve as significant storage units for electricity in the future there are also many other innovations related to the
production storage and use of energy we just need to put them into practice kangas says


 one example is the development of smart devices which will see equipment that uses electricity do so when it is cheapest due to the
prevailing conditions such as sunshine or windy weather she envisions




     climate change increases the earths average temperature
          climate change results in a rise in the earths average temperature
          climate change causes an increase in extreme weather phenomena such as drought and flooding energy conservation and
           energy efficiency play a significant role in slowing down climate change
          with regard to properties the key is to renovate buildings to make them energy efficient and inform their users of how to save
           energy
          when energy consumption decreases a larger proportion of our energy requirements can be covered by zeroemission and
           renewable energy sources

building a more condensed and comfortable city
the trend of urbanisation is continuing in finland as the population concentrates in areas where jobs are located and in particular
the cities at the heart of such areas according to the urban helsinki collective growing cities should focus on condensing the urban
structure this would also provide opportunities for creating an even more comfortable and attractive urban environment


 in finland the helsinki region has a particularly strong pull but other major cities are also growing as a result of migration and natural
population growth the population is concentrating in major cities and within these the city centres are gaining new strength a growing number
of young people want to live in an urban environment says miika norppa a member of the urban helsinki collective


the aim of the urban helsinki collective is to help helsinki and other finnish cities             encounters between people
respond to the challenges presented by population growth and in particular the
                                                                                                  promote the exchange of ideas

the urban helsinki group says the best response to this challenge is condensing                   and they also help prevent social
the urban structure the concept for a more condensed city of the future is
                                                                                                  exclusion
described in the pro helsinki 20 shadow city plan urban helsinkis alternative to
the city of helsinkis official city plan


 in our shadow city plan we propose that building a more condensed city with effective public transportation will make it possible to offer
hundreds of thousands of new residents homes in a comfortable urban environment says timo hämäläinen a member of urban helsinki



space for meetings and innovations

in many finnish cities the areas where jobs are located are separate from the areas where people live according to norppa and hämäläinen it
is important from the perspective of comfort and attractiveness that condensing the urban structure involves the development of new properties
with offices and apartments as well as retail space on the ground level their services could be used in the daytime by people who work in the
area and in the evenings by the residents of the area

environment becomes he explains




    urbanisation is an ongoing process
         in finland the process of urbanisation is still rather incomplete compared to sweden for example
         the helsinki region in particular has a strong pull and other cities are also seeing population growth new jobs are concentrated
          in growing cities
         urbanisation results in the need to create a condensed city in which residents enjoy life and businesses prosper

the many faces of the shops of the future
in the vision of consultant and senior advisor marjaana toiminen the shops of the future are very versatile what they have in
common is a smooth customer experience but the shops themselves may be anything from simple walls with images of products to
entertainment centres providing unique experiences


with the growth of ecommerce especially retailers in traditional brick and mortar shops are wondering how to reach consumers that seem to be
disappearing into the world of online stores


 even though luring people into stores might be more difficult in the future there are ideas that can be implemented easily and affordably to
raise the importance of brick and mortar shops and shopping centres in the everyday lives of city dwellers and as part of urban culture says
consultant and senior advisor marjaana toiminen


for example events and entertainment do not need to be confined to restaurants                at its most minimal the shop of

according to toiminen the growth of online retail is a clear trend but at the same           entertainment space
time the increasing ease of shopping offers retail new opportunities as the
purchasing threshold is becoming lower or even disappearing in future the customer will be increasingly reachable and more liable to make

encounters in different channels

according to toiminen for a brick and mortar business to be successful it needs to take advantage of different communications channels to
reach its customers

in its new climate policy the european union has made a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels
by 2030 a further binding target at the eu level is to increase the use of renewable energy by 27 per cent and an indicative target has been set
to improve energy efficiency by 27 per cent the eu has a further target of reducing emissions by 8095 per cent by 2050 according to a
directive that will enter into force at the start of 2021 all new buildings must be nearly zeroenergy buildings a nearly zeroenergy buildings
energy requirement is covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources produced onsite or nearby


finland is preparing the national implementation of the eu energy efficiency directive as well as the new business sector energy efficiency
agreement period which will begin from 2017 finlands energy and climate roadmap 2050 was published in 2014 the roadmap 2050 serves
as a strategy guide on the journey towards achieving finlands longterm objective of being a carbonneutral society building a carbonneutral
society requires contributions from all sectors


sponda aims to respond to the requirements and the targets set by the eu and finland and energy efficiency is an important consideration in all
of the companys property development projects as well as in renovation maintenance and use of properties improving the energy efficiency of
buildings also reduces carbon dioxide emissions going forward the use of renewable energy will play a significant role in achieving the targets
set through its involvement in various organisations sponda is actively monitoring the progress of eu and finnish projects legislation and
agreements related to energy efficiency


every day approximately 30000 people work in premises owned by sponda as much as 60 per cent of the total energy consumption of a
building occurs during the use of the building which means that cooperation between the landlord and tenants aimed at reducing energy
consumption is of crucial importance through its energy efficiency and environmental partnership programmes sponda encourages its clients
to be energy efficient and to take environmental aspects into consideration in the use of properties and provides guidance to its clients on energy
efficiency and environmentally friendly building use


sponda monitors the energy and water consumption as well as waste management volumes of its properties located in finland on a monthly
quarterly and annual basis for properties in russia the consumption of electricity and water are monitored on a monthly and annual basis



environmentally responsible property development

at sponda new construction property renovation and the design of lowenergy office buildings are all subject to the companys design
guidelines which are reviewed and updated annually and are in many ways more extensive than the generally applied standards and
regulations the guidelines help the company develop adaptable and energy efficient properties that offer functional working environments


sponda pays particular attention to environmental requirements in its property development operations sponda applies for international
environmental classification an environmental certificate for all new buildings and major renovation projects at the end of 2014 sponda had
eight environmentally certified properties and several certification projects in progress



spondas energy efficiency programme is aimed at conserving energy

the energy efficient use of properties is supported particularly through spondas energy efficiency programme which is aimed at achieving
energy savings in cooperation with clients the properties included in the programme carry out regular energy reviews to determine the energy
consumption of each property and to examine the different technical systems relating to energy consumption based on these reviews
adjustments repairs and investments that are in line with properties use and profitable from a technicaleconomic standpoint are made


spondas energy efficiency programmes target of achieving energy savings of 10 per cent by 2016 using the average consumption in
20012005 as the baseline was achieved ahead of schedule in 2013 the longterm target is to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in energy
consumption by 2020 compared to the average consumption in 20012005 spondas progress with respect to the achievement of the longterm
target is on schedule


energysaving goals and measures for achieving them are set individually for each property in cooperation with the users developments are
then monitored in regular meetings with clients the cost savings achieved through the energy efficiency programme are reinvested in the
property spondas partners corbel oy and ovenia oy are responsible for property service and maintenance operations as well as for collecting

spondas environmental partnerships

in 2011 spondas energy efficiency programme was complemented by an environmental partnership programme aimed at reducing the
environmental load resulting from the use of properties by engaging in closer cooperation with customers in addition to energy consumption the
programme takes into account the broader environmental impact of properties and customers operations


sponda and its environmental partners organise environmental events to distribute information to the users of properties on propertyspecific
environmental matters and energy efficiency and responsibility in general



spondas green lease

in the green lease model the customer and sponda agree on joint objectives and compensation models to encourage the use of
environmentally friendly solutions and the reduction of energy consumption under the agreement savings and excesses in energy costs are
divided annually between the tenant and the landlord



environmental information for employees

the environmental expertise of spondas employees is improved with the help of the wwf green office programme spondas head office is a
green office environmental awareness is also increased in other ways such as the annual green day environmental event internal training
events as well as green office tips published regularly on the company intranet and spondas facebook page


employees are encouraged to make ecological choices through a company car policy that supports lowemission options employees are also
provided with company bicycles as part of spondas green office environmental programme employees are also trained in economical driving




property locations
sponda takes environmental considerations into account in deciding on the locations for its property investments the companys
properties are in key areas in major cities and in locations easily accessible by public transportation which helps reduce the
environmental impacts of the properties during their use



the key aspects of the priority are

   taking environmental aspects into account in making decisions on property investments
   focusing on properties located in cities accessible by public transportation
   concentrating on prime areas
   investments in property assets



why is this a priority

for sponda the central location of its properties is a key strategic choice the companys properties are in key areas in the helsinki metropolitan
area and tampere in locations with good public transport links approximately 75 per cent of spondas properties are located in these areas in
its building projects sponda takes into account not just the building itself but also the close surroundings and that the building as a whole fits in
with the urbanscape


spondas investment strategy is sustainable both financially and environmentally accessibility is an increasingly important factor in the decisions
companies make regarding business premises it is perceived as a way of supporting the mobility of customers and employees as well as an
opportunity to reduce emissions caused by commuting companies located in areas with high traffic flows also achieve a competitive advantage
through greater visibility

                                                                             annual report 2014  trends and the future

the demand and rental levels for properties located in the central areas of cities are more stable even in economically uncertain times in line
with its strategy sponda aims to concentrate its property portfolio in the city centres and other rapidly growing areas of helsinki and tampere
while divesting properties located in sparsely populated areas or on the fringes of cities


location is one of the criteria applied in the environmental certification of business properties the breeam and leed certification processes
take into account not only the energy consumption of the building but also factors such as public transport links and bicycle parking facilities




enhancing the customer experience
at sponda the customer experience consists of comfortable business premises that meet customer needs as well as competent and
professional customer service sponda aims to develop interactive longterm partnerships with its customers



the key aspects of the priority are

   working environments and property services that support the customers operations
   comfort of the indoor environment
   customer safety and health
   supporting the customers responsibility goals



why is this a priority

the significance of the customer experience will continue to grow in the property sector as companies that seek business premises are
increasingly focusing not only on prices per square metre but also other factors trends such as the transformation in working culture changes
in purchasing behaviour and awareness of environmental impacts are placing greater requirements on business premises and their suppliers


the key building blocks of the customer experience are functional and highquality business premises as well as competent personnel who
understand the customers needs sponda offers comfortable and flexible working environments that support the customers operations the
safety and health of business premises customers is ensured by focusing on the comfort of the indoor environment specifically cleanliness air
quality and temperature


in the property sector customer relationships are typically long term the process of finding the right business premises takes time and leases
are signed for periods of several years in customer relationships spondas goal is to achieve a longterm interactive partnership rather than a
unilateral lessortenant relationship this allows the customer to receive the maximum benefit from spondas strengths namely the expertise of
its personnel and its comprehensive portfolio of business premises


at the end of 2014 sponda had a total of 1887 customers and 2923 lease agreements the largest client sectors were the public sector retail
and banking



continuous focus on customer service

the customer experience often begins even before the actual customer relationship is established as customers search for different business
premises alternatives and suppliers with this in mind spondas aim is to be easily approachable via a variety of channels and the company
continuously develops various forms of customer service


during the lessortenant relationship the emphasis is on property services the continuous development of the customer relationship and
maintaining active contact with the customer the aim of customer service operations is to allow the customer to focus on their own business
while sponda handles all propertyrelated services in cooperation with its property management partners

investment properties in 2014
spondas investment properties business unit is responsible for the leasing purchase and sales of office retail and logistics
properties the year 2014 was a challenging one for the leasing market but a busy one with respect to purchases and sales


spondas office properties and retail premises are primarily located in the helsinki city centre the helsinki metropolitan area and tampere in
finland sponda owns five shopping centres which are located in helsinki and in the districts of tampere and oulu the largest of these is the
citycenter property in helsinkis central business district


the investment properties segments total revenue in 2014 was eur 2184 million and the economic occupancy rate was 867 per cent at year
end economic uncertainty made the leasing market challenging and sponda fell short of its targeted economic occupancy rate the factors
contributing to this include the decreased need for business premises as companies reduce personnel the dragging on of decisionmaking
regarding business premises and the transformation of the retail sector where traditional retail is threatened by the growth of online retail at the
same time the amount of vacant premises on the market increased there was also an increase in bankruptcies and debt structuring among the
customer base



strategic property investment

the implementation of spondas strategy proceeded as planned in 2014 in september the company divested its real estate fund business and
sold 12 logistics properties to certeum a new investment company focused on logistics and industrial properties for eur 2167 million


in line with its strategy sponda reduced its property ownership also in turku during the year at the end of 2014 sponda owned only two
properties in turku in july sponda purchased an office property located in central tampere from ubs real estate kapitalanlagegesellschaft
mbh for eur 637 million the property is almost fully occupied the acquisition supports spondas growth in tampere


at the end of 2014 the total fair value of spondas finnish property portfolio comprised 67 per cent office properties 26 per cent shopping
centres and 7 per cent logistics properties properties were sold at a value of eur 2373 million during the year 2013 eur 231 million the
company invested eur 415 million in property maintenance and improving the quality of properties during the year eur 223 million

gross domestic product is projected to rise by 01 per cent whereas in 2013 finlands gdp declined by 12 per cent the turn in 2014 was
brought about particularly by growth in net exports


in 2015 finlands gdp is projected to grow by 09 per cent in addition to exports the growth is spurred to some extent by increasing private
consumption imports and private investments however even if economic activities will gradually pick up the mismatch problems between
supply and demand will continue to sustain longterm unemployment development in the productivity of labour will also remain modest inflation

russia

according to a world bank forecast russian gdp grew by 07 per cent in 2014 in 2015 the countrys gdp is expected to contract by 29 per
cent although russias volatile economic situation renders any projections uncertain the economic downswing is the result of geopolitical
tensions the economic sanctions against russia and the development of oil prices


the decline in the value of the rouble and the resulting increase in uncertainty slowed down the property transactions market in russia in the
fourth quarter of 2014 according to cbres data the transaction volume for the fourth quarter stood at usd 035 billion while the transaction
volume for the entire year stood at usd 35 billion the pace of transactions fell by half compared to 2013 when the volume was approximately
usd 7 billion

year the vacancy rate for a class office spaces was approximately 28 per cent and the vacancy rate for b class spaces approximately 128 per
cent decreased demand and the massive volume of newly constructed premises create upward pressure on vacancy rates and downward
pressure on rents

in 2009 more than half of the spaces completed were a class offices

measures taken in 2014

progress of spondas energy efficiency programme

at the end of 2014 spondas energy efficiency programme covered 113 2013 109 properties which means that as many as 88 per cent of
spondas whollyowned properties in finland are included in the programme ten properties divested during the year as part of the certeum
transaction were omitted from spondas energy efficiency programme the properties covered by the programme continued to carry out energy
reviews implement energy saving measures and monitor consumption in accordance with propertyspecific action plans


a total of 68 energy reviews of properties owned by sponda were carried out in 2014 the most important energy saving measures implemented
in 2014 were measures concerning the use of ventilation and heating systems additionally energy efficiency improvement measures were
implemented concerning the cooling of properties building automation systems and the use of electricity at properties


the energy consumption and carbon footprint of spondas properties declined

the comparable energy consumption of the finnish properties owned by sponda decreased by 20 per cent in 2014 the measured heating
energy consumption of comparable properties was down by 12 per cent from the previous year weatheradjusted normalised heating energy
consumption was 03 per cent lower than the year before the total electricity consumption of comparable properties decreased by 39 per cent
water consumption decreased by 05 per cent and district cooling consumption fell by 81 per cent compared to 2013


in 2014 the carbon footprint caused by the total energy consumption of all of spondas comparable properties in finland was 23 per cent lower
than in the previous year


sponda aims to reduce the energy consumption of its properties also in russia in 2014 the electricity consumption of spondas office properties
in russia decreased by 61 per cent and water consumption decreased by 63 per cent


sponda also aims to actively reduce its own environmental impact by reducing the energy consumption and other environmental loads of its head
office in helsinki the year 2014 was an exceptional one at spondas head office and consumption was not reduced in line with the targets
renovation work was carried out in the building there were relocation operations as well as water damage due to these circumstances
consumption figures for 2014 were higher than in the previous year in 2014 the electricity consumption of spondas head office increased by 37
per cent normalised heating consumption increased by 11 per cent measured heating energy consumption decreased by 17 per cent and
district cooling consumption increased by 81 per cent the water consumption of the head office decreased by 36 per cent compared to 2013
because of the aforementioned reasons the head offices consumption figures for 2015 will be compared to the figures reported for 2013


of the total energy consumed by sponda 14 per cent is produced from renewable sources renewable energy sources account for 17 per cent
of the electricity used by sponda 7 per cent of heating and 76 per cent of district cooling

scope of the report and data collection

the figures that appear in the report are based on the figures of spondas operations in finland unless otherwise indicated figures for the
companys subsidiaries are mentioned separately unless otherwise indicated there have been no changes in the scope or method of calculation
of the reporting principles


there is a certain degree of annual variability in spondas property holdings due to sales and purchases which affects the comparability of the
annual environmental figures



calculation principles for environmental reporting

the calculation of environmental indicators takes into account spondas properties located in finland the figures cover all spondaowned
properties for which the responsibility for maintenance lies with the property owner the figures also include 43 per cent of the properties that
sponda owns partially or for which the responsibility for maintenance lies with the tenant properties leased cold russian operations are
reported separately for the indicators that include them for russia electricity and water consumption data is reported for three office properties
there is a certain degree of annual variability in spondas property holdings due to sales and purchases which affects the comparability of the
annual environment figures for this reason the comparable consumption has been reported separately


the energy consumption of spondas properties consists of purchased energy the company has no energy production of its own carbon
dioxide emissions caused by purchased energy also constitute the majority of the total greenhouse gas emissions reported

energy consumption monitoring extends to all properties for which sponda is responsible for energy purchasing a total of 138 spondas totally or
partially owned properties were subject to energy consumption monitoring in 2014 representing 82 per cent of spondas property portfolio of
these 121 properties are subject to hourly monitoring while consumption at 15 properties is monitored by means of manual meter reading
cooling is monitored separately for those properties that use district cooling if cooling is performed by compressors it is included in the
electricity consumption the unit used in monitoring the consumption of purchased energy is the mwh total energy consumption is also reported
in gj using the conversion rate 1 mwh  36 gj source iea international energy agency in specific consumption information data on gross
floor area gfam2 corresponds to consumption data properties that were sold or bought or were covered by consumption monitoring only for
part of the year are not included in the calculations on specific consumption energy consumption is divided by the number of spondas
properties excluding sold properties and properties included under property development the figures presented by segments do not include
properties under property development


information on waste covers all properties for which the responsibility to arrange waste management lies with a spondaowned property or
mutual real estate company at the end of 2014 waste monitoring covered 85 per cent of the properties owned by sponda in finland waste
covered in tenants own waste management agreements are not included in the reporting the reported information on waste is based on waste
volumes reported by waste management service providers


co2 emissions and the use of renewable energy sources have been estimated using publicly available information provided by energy
companies on the specific emissions of energy production and the energy source distribution of energy production the calculation of co2
emissions for 2014 is based on emission factors reported by energy companies in 2013 for heating carbon dioxide emissions are calculated
based on measured heating consumption for district heating municipalityspecific emission factors have been used data for other reported
years has been calculated using the actual emission factor for each year at present sponda does not report on greenhouse gas emissions other
than carbon dioxide or their global warming potential


with respect to indirect greenhouse gas emissions sponda reports on carbon dioxide emissions from waste management business air travel
and leased cars the waste management emission calculations are based on the ghg protocol and they cover 98 per cent of the waste
management sponda is responsible for including both waste transportation and treatment emissions from business air travel are based
on flight miles and the emission factors reported by airlines the emissions from leased cars are based on spondas emissions data on leased
cars and kilometres driven per year indirect greenhouse gas emissions are reported at the company level
