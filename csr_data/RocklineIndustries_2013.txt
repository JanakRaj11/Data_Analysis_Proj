            this year was a great year for rockline industries our company grew and expanded at
            numerous sites adding over 130 jobs we introduced new products to the marketplace
            and we achieved key milestones in our sustainability program

            four our mission is to take positive steps towards a more environmentally sustainable
            business this report highlights the activities and initiatives that are helping get us closer



president
            to that mission

            this year many of our customers increased their focus on environmental sustainability
            which pushed us to deliver even better results we welcome the increased interaction
            from our suppliers and customers as our collaborative efforts result in a better
            environment for the consumers of our products

            we continue to drive toward our 2015 targets in energy waste and landfill rate
            additionally we have finally charted a consistent downward trend in our wastewater
            metric driving down wastewater 2 from our 2009 baseline

            we also implemented our second generation of the green score toola newer more
            userfriendly tool that gives a snapshot of the environmental impacts of our raw
            material choices and helps us get closer to our aspiration of creating more ecologically
            intelligent products

            our logistics team has further expanded rocklines use of pool point and intermodal
            shipping just a few of the many innovative ways they have found to optimize shipments
            and reduce the carbon footprint of our shipping network

            the purpose of this report is to give a quantitative and transparent account of our
            progress against our sustainability goals we want to fulfill our mission of delivering

geothermal expansion
our geothermal        rocklines booneville ark facility has introduced a number of largescale
                      sustainability initiatives over the past five years in previous reports we
heating and           have written about our geothermal heating and cooling system the largest
cooling system is     single environmental initiative in rocklines history the system uses the
                      relatively constant temperate of the earths crust to heat and cool our

                      wells that measure 400 feet in depth
                      using a closedloop waterpipe works the system sends water 400 feet

                      chiller and a fan system blows the chilled air into the production rooms
                      similarly in the warm months the water runs through a hot coil and the
                      warm air is used to heat the production rooms because the system oper

wastewater
wet wipes coffee     water is one of the main raw materials in wet wipes accounting for the
filters and baking   majority of the product weight much of the water consumed by
                      rockline leaves our plant in the form of finished goods
cups all use water
differently          therefore rockline defines wastewater as any water that is not a
                      component of the products we manufacture our wastewater metric
                      focuses on reducing the amount of water consumed by rockline outside
                      of the finished product

                      this includes
                             water used in the creation of the wet wipe lotions that are
                              wasted due to line inefficiencies
                             water used to generate steam which gives basketstyle
                              coffee filters and baking cups their distinctive shapes
                             water used in quality testing and cleaning
                             water used by employees

                      rockline will never sacrifice product quality to
                      save water but focusing on more efficient water
                      use even in testing and cleaning is a priority

solid waste
the result of the    reducing waste ultimately means reducing the virgin natural resources
                     needed to produce a finished good
inefficient use of
raw materials
                     rockline focuses on measuring reducing and
                     eliminating waste from our manufacturing
                     processes to provide better value to our customers
                     rockline defines solid waste as all waste leaving our facility regardless of how
                     it is generated or handled for example our coffee filter production
                     generates a high amount of waste because the round filters are cut from
                     square sheets of paper even though the paper scrap is recycled it is still
                     considered waste because a truly efficient process would use all of the
                     paper

                     because solid waste is generatedand thus reduceddifferently in coffee
                     filter converting and wet wipe converting we have separate metrics and set
                     different goals for each

landfill

all solid waste that is   ultimately rockline would like to eliminate solid
not recycled reused     waste entirely from its production processes but
or incinerated for        where this is not yet feasible rocklines goal is to
energy recapture is       handle waste in a way that has the smallest impact
sent to landfill         on the environment
                          our landfill avoidance initiatives are captured in the landfill rate metric to
                          calculate our landfill rate we divide the amount of waste sent to landfill by the
                          total amount of waste leaving our facilities which includes landfilled waste as
                          well as recycled waste waste incinerated for energy recapture and waste
                          donated for reuse
