          contribution to the collaborative global effort we have aligned our sustainability
          philosophy and practice to the un sustainability development goals


          responsible growth
          it is our strong conviction that higher accountability yields better outcomes
          and thus it is our constant effort to go beyond compliance in all three domains 
          environmental social and economic at vedanta we continue to focus on those
          factors that are in our control this includes delivering production and growth
          optimizing costs and leveraging technology  innovation for operational
          excellence to run our business even more efﬁciently and productively with
          robust safety health and environmental performance

          vedanta acknowledges the rising global concern on climate change and
          continues to take sustained action to reduce its impact through energy
          conservation we have revised the vedanta carbon policy and carbon strategy
          under which we have set ourselves a goal to reduce our carbon intensity
          we expect to achieve up to 16 reduction in carbon intensity by 2020 from a
          2012 baseline which was the ﬁrst year of audited data we are also scaling up
          solar energy in our energy mix hindustan zinc commissioned a 16 mw solar
          power plant this year and has set a target of 115 mw in the shortterm

          water is a critical resource for vedanta and we are
          committed to save every drop we can this year we have
          achieved 173 of our total water saving target

prioritise our interventions accordingly


two years ago we conducted a comprehensive groupwide materiality process comprising identiﬁcation of material sustainability topics
prioritisation of these topics and veriﬁcation of our analysis
to understand the perspective of external stakeholders we continue to engage with our six core stakeholder groups shareholders and lenders
industry suppliers customers and peers civil society ngos and other organisations governments employees and communities on a
continuing basis we also conduct a detailed ranking exercise to understand the importance given to certain material issues by the stakeholders
to get the managements perspective we conduct internal leadership and operational management workshops interviews and ranking exercises



material aspects
the responses from the ranking exercises are sieved through two measures relevance to vedantas stakeholders and relevance to vedanta
management and what emerges is a materiality matrix that is an eclectic mix of sustainability issues that is relevant to us and our stakeholders
this year we have revalidated this materiality matrix

implementation of
safety performance
standards
last year we initiated our ﬁrst step towards elimination of critical hazards by identifying six
types of them that account for approximately 75 of lost time incidents and grouped
them under one common protocol group safety performance standards

the six critical areas identiﬁed were

work at height  isolation  electrical safety 
ground control  confined space entry  vehicles  driving
this year we initiated a seventh safety performance
standard sps on cranes and lifting

                                                                                                                                               25

in addition to the seven speciﬁc standards we
have two technical standards that govern
occupational health management and safety

   condensing vent steam to conserve water
   chanderiya hzl

   around 4345 ton of steam is generated from whrb at the chanderiya hydroi plant at hzl this steam is used to generate the power in
   condensate type turbine of 940 mw during this process approximately 68 tph of excess steam was being vented off  contributing to
   water loss of approx 150 m3day

   we took up an initiative to utilise this vent steam whereby the vent steam was condensed by utilising the available spent heat
   exchanger the condensing system was connected before the ﬁnal vent to convert the excess steam into condensate water and recycled
   the same to the boiler circuit the task was completed inhouse with available resources



        due to additional inbuilt capacity vent steam of hydro2 roaster was also condensed with
        the same system this lead to a water recovery of more than 200 m3day against the target
        of 130 m3day from vent steam

considering the number of sectors dependent on natural products loss of biodiversity must be seen as an economic as well as an environmental
loss being a responsible natural resources company we actively follow the nonetloss principle and protect or rejuvenate the biodiversity

protecting the biodiversity is an integral part of vedantas commitment to sustainable development our biodiversity management programme is
developed to avoid minimise or compensate the loss of the biodiversity attributes resultant to the new project or the major expansion we
undertake environmental social impact assessment esia assessment for any new project or major expansion to help us understand the presence
of critical biodiversity attributes in the proposed area of the project and develop biodiversity action plan to mitigate the impact of our operation
on the same




approach
we have a dedicated biodiversity policy and management standard in line with international
standards and guidelines of international finance corporation ifc it advises how disruption is        vedanta resources is a
to be avoided minimised and compensated for from project scoping to site closure and beyond           signatory to the india
our policy technical standard and approach to biodiversity management is aligned to ifc                 business and biodiversity
standards and icmm guidelines our businesses seek consultation from domain experts in                   initiative a national

vedanta we are committed to identify and manage emissions to air from point sources and from process activities associated with combustion

as part of our ambient air quality monitoring process we monitor particulate matter pm sox and nox we also monitor lead emissions from our
zinc operations ﬂuoride emissions and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs from our aluminium operations as per our environmental

  waste
waste generation for the natural resources industry is inevitable but its disposal is not with the right mindset technology and innovation there is
a tremendous wealth generation opportunity in addition to the elimination or minimisation of waste

at vedanta two kinds of waste are generated hazardous and nonhazardous the hazardous waste include usedspent oil waste refractories
aluminium dross spent pot lining and residual sludge from smelters while the nonhazardous high volume low effect wastes include ﬂy ash
from captive and merchant power plants jaroﬁx from zinc smelting slag lime grit process residues from smelters and aluminium reﬁneries
and phospho gypsum phosphoric acid plant

lisheen mine  closure
restoration and aftercare
management plan
mining activity at the lisheen mine in ireland was concluded in november 2015 with milling ceasing in december 2015
after 17 years of operation focusing on physical closure of the mine and aftercare of the site a best practice mine
closure plan has been implemented to fully address regulatory authority permit requirements the cessation of mining
at lisheen was not the end of the story as the mine is now in an active closure phase the closure programme is
among the worlds ﬁnest examples of environmentally sensitive mine closure and rehabilitation some socioeconomic
and environmental initiatives taken by the company to ensure wellbeing of the community and the environment

some of key focus areas of closure plan are
ensuring that the underground             blocking and sealing all access to        creating a space that will be
workings cannot collapse                 the underground workings                  attractive to other industries
leading to surface subsidence

at vedanta it is our continuing endeavour to minimise any negative impact on communities
and our planet that arises as a result of our operations sustainable development is at
the core of all our business decisions across every stage of all our projects the lifecycle
of all our projects is strictly governed by our sustainable development framework


our sustainable development framework is aligned to international benchmarks such as icmm and ifc and includes several standards requiring
comprehensive impact assessment on environment social economic and regulatory fronts the sustainability standards ensure continuous
monitoring and due diligence appraisals in project management new projects potential acquisitions and site closure




new projects
for us a new project is not just a means of adding more value to the shareholders it is a responsibility to add value to the host countries their
biodiversity and the local communities this helps us maintain the preferred social license to operate prior to developing new projects we
undertake location speciﬁc needs assessment studies and analyse the project from its exploration stage to closure to identify potential impacts
and the likely affected parties


new projects begin with stakeholder engagements
effective stakeholder engagement is key to successful project management every project has a           to increase the efﬁciency of our engagement

site closure
our commitment to the communities extends beyond the closure of the operations a mine closure is in fact the beginning of a comprehensive
and welldesigned aftercare process that enriches not only the local communities but also the restoration of natural habitat and ecosystems

the mutually agreed solutions to the environmental and social risks identiﬁed through the environmental and social impact assessment esia at
the onset of every project also include the site closure plans our sustainable development framework includes a site closure standard which is
continually aligned and updated to match the international good practices benchmark

  impact

through 10 phases starting from march 2015 to december 2016 all 360 employees were covered by the outplacement
programme it addressed peoples concerns and anxieties ensuring that positive mentality was maintained all throughout
the potentially difﬁcult last few months

the programme has been quite a success with a majority of exlisheen employees ﬁnding alternative
work while some have moved into other industries some continue to work for other mines in ireland
few workers have also chosen to stay within the vedanta family and have moved to our mines in africa

skorpion zincs karas goat project is a beacon of hope for the economic emancipation of rural                farmers
people in namibia the project started in march 2012 aims to accelerate poverty eradication in             for agriculture and allied interventions
namibia by offering rural underprivileged families a sustainable entrepreneurial opportunity
through goat farming

the goat project was launched in collaboration with the ofﬁce of the governor and the nama
traditional authorities after a needs assessment was carried out by the ministry of agriculture it is
designed to be sustainable and to provide cascading beneﬁts in order to set off a cascading effect
after three years some of the offspring are given to a second set of beneﬁciaries who in turn replicate
the entire process this essentially creates a virtuous cycle that can endure for many years to come

in fy 201617 the project added 5 new families bringing the number of beneﬁciaries to
21 each beneﬁciary receives 31 goats more than 60 of the beneﬁciaries are women 
a deliberate intervention to assist womenheaded households in rural namibia

           mining is still widely regarded as a mans profession thus we see
           fewer women working in the mining areas while setting up the
           gamsberg project we saw great potential in training the women from
           khaima region to work in an open pit mine as haul truck operators
           roux mining our contractor and business partner joined forces with
           us on a pilot project to provide the required training


           more than 180 applications were received the shortlisted women were interviewed by a panel comprising representatives
           from roux mining management gamsberg project hr and the national union of mineworkers 14 candidates were selected
           and given a 4hour tour of gamsberg during this tour they had the opportunity to ride in a 100tonne
           haul truck while observing an experienced operator of these candidates 9 women were ultimately
           selected for the pilot programme the remaining candidates will be given an opportunity in the future



                                                   50            quality hours of operating
           the programme consists of theoretical
           and practical training that includes
                                                                 a haul truck
           learners are registered with the mining qualiﬁcations authority and receive a monthly stipend during their training both
           gamsberg project and roux mining are responsible for learners wellbeing in terms of accommodation meals travel costs and
           stipends through this initiative we aim to change the way women are viewed in mining and open doors to one more economic
           opportunity for them

methodology adopted for assurance
our assurance processes involve performing procedures to obtain evidence about the reliability of speciﬁed performance information the nature timing and extent
of procedures selected depend on our judgment including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the selected sustainability disclosures whether
due to fraud or error in making those risk assessments we have considered internal controls relevant to the preparation of the report in order to design assurance
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances

we have obtained sample evidence information and explanations that were considered necessary in relation to the assurance scope and have arrived at conclusions
mentioned below our work included a range of evidencegathering procedures including
 assessing that the report is prepared in accordance with the sustainability reporting guidelines of the global reporting initiative gri g4  in accordance
  core criteria
 reviewing the report to ensure that there is no misrepresentation of disclosures as per scope of assurance and our ﬁndings
