                                      dear friends

                                      we have prepared this sustainability report in a
                                      very special context in 2016 antamina celebrated
                                      its ﬁrst 15 years of operation

                                      this has been a period of hard work focused
                                      on achieving operational efﬁciency safe for our
                                      employees and respectful of the environment
                                      at the same time we have sought to connect
                                      with our stakeholders and integrate ourselves
                                      as an agent that promotes the development in
                                      our area of operative inﬂuence

                                      in these ﬁrst 15 years we have consolidated
                                      the formation of a highperformance team
                                      committed with our values essential for our
                                      progress towards operational excellence besides
                                      we have formed a culture of prevention where
                                      the most important things are the wellbeing and
                                      health of the people

                                      another of our concerns has been the training
                                      of our employees and their motivation boosting
                                      the integration of corporate values in their daily
                                      activities maybe due to motives like these
                                      three studies found antamina as one of the best
                                      companies to work in peru

                                      our search for operational excellence is also
                                      present in our environmental management one

21 antaminas history

the word anta means copper in the indigenous language of quechua and was the source for
the name antamina or copper mine since the time of the chavin civilization the people
of ancient peru already knew about the properties of copper and they utilized it for religious
purposes their skill in working with metals was used to communicate their beliefs because the
motifs were complex religious symbols

                                       1996                     1998 preparation of             2010 announced

                         focuses on strengthening trust between antamina
                         and the local actors it handles complaints from
                         stakeholder groups who have a direct or indirect
                         relationship with our company the protocols
                         permit reception of written or oral statements
                         in which the claimant alleges that he or she is
                         the victim of any type of harm arising from the
                         execution of company activities andor acts
                         committed by its workers or its strategic partners
                         in this sense for purposes of this document
                         the concept of claim is to be interpreted as
                         synonymous the words complaint or dispute

                         once these statements manifesting discomfort are
                         recorded in our process they are automatically
                         considered as claims because they create an
                         expectation on the part of the claimant who
                         considers that the case merits compensation
                         clariﬁcation warning or amendment on the
                         part of the company due to the situation that
                         motivated the complaint

                         the attention of those claims requires the
                         participation of different areas of the company
                         such as environment legal social management

honor a commitment for the responsible use of
water resources despite our main operations are
 located in a region with an annual precipitation
beyond 1000mm and with high water availability
we count with a water management plan developd
to ensure the availability of the resource
needed for operations considering the best
practices and an array of ﬂexible options for
its management that allow us to minimize our
impacts in the environment and at the same
time avoid impacts on the water requirements
of the surrounding communities


a surface water
to satisfy our requirements for the mining area
we directly collect rainwater using dams and
channels this way we do not compete with
other users in the use of this resource

it is important to mention that during 2016
9917 of the water used in the production
process was recycled from the tailings pond

and activities aimed at minimizing waste
generation

comprehensive and sustainable waste
management at our operations combines waste
collection methods waste separation systems
valuation and use to accomplish this we have
implemented different awareness campaigns
and correct waste separation methods

currently the practice of recycling and separating
waste at the place where it is generated is
gaining momentum and notoriety in our society
in this regard our collaborators are committed
to these actions both for environmental and
ecological reasons preserving natural resources
by reincorporating the waste into the industrial
processes as for economic ones decline in costs
of collection transport and ﬁnal disposal
