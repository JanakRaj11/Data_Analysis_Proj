at bpcl sustainability is perceived in the wider dimension by focusing on the core thinking of the business and adop ng
sustainable prac ces intrinsically we believe that energizing lives has to start from within the company and aim to
develop an energized workforce that can uphold the bpcl vision
bpcls dream plan envisions seven key areas focused on our employees and we have ini ated more than ﬁ y ini a ves
under these seven areas bpcl has ins tuted a comprehensive talent review process where we have iden ﬁed about
2500 poten al future leaders a er 2 to 3 levels of talent hunts as a part of this process leaders have been iden ﬁed at
the levels of the company business and the sbus
the career development and progression of our employees is of prime importance for us we have been working on
developing an integrated career development framework which will cover four key components for an employees
career progression and it revolves around the aspira ons and growth of the employees keeping in mind their talents
skills and competencies we are enthused about successfully implemen ng this framework across a large and complex
organiza on like bpcl
we are also focused on developing a longterm rela onship with our suppliers which transcends individual transac ons
and builds their capacity in a sustained manner while we are inspired to learn that our employees view us as a
company based on strong values as evident from the employee sa sfac on survey it is important for us to translate this
across the en re value chain of the company by involving our suppliers contractors and vendors
the csr approach of bpcl rests on 3 pillars of enlightened business interest involving the communi es close to our
project sites and long term na on building we have embarked on csr projects focused on 2 core areas in which we
target to make a serious impact ie water and educa on we also have ini ated projects to touch other dimensions of
the social fabric by providing livelihood opportuni es and indirect employment to marginalized groups like the widows
of farmers who have commi ed suicides
we ini ate various projects with set goals and a well thought out entrance and exit strategies we are increasingly
focused on suppor ng the cause of infrastructure development for communi es with acute need of schools water
resources and other such essen al requirements
the 3 factors that are important to us for our csr related projects are  commi ed ngo partners a concrete project
and the quality of the people involved impact assessment is a crucial aspect of our csr projects each project is
subjected to a preinterven on survey midterm survey and a ﬁnal survey at the me of exit we undertake a course
correc on if we realize that the project is not achieving the set targets
csr eﬀorts make complete business sense to us and therefore we include our new recruits as a part of these eﬀorts it is
compulsory for all our management trainees at the me of induc on to spend one week at one of the sites of our csr
project loca ons
our eﬀorts in this direc on have been appreciated externally this is amply proven by the awards we have bagged in the
space of human capital management sustainability leadership and corporate social responsibility

strategic risks and opportuni es




4 strategic risks and opportunities
oil and gas sector outlook               india and globally
demand for crude oil is declining in the countries belonging to the organiza on of economic coopera on and
development oecd even as it increases in china and india the supply of crude oil was threatened at mes due to geo
poli cal factors like the domes c situa on in several countries of the arab world and sanc ons against iran by the united
states of america and the european union but the supply was balanced as the members of the oil and petroleum
expor ng countries opec had ramped up produc on thereby ensuring stability in oil prices which was about usd
110 per barrel average price of the benchmark crude oil
the demand for petroleum products in india grew at a rate of 49 based on the provisional data released by the
petroleum planning and analysis cell ppac of the ministry of petroleum  natural gas the government of india also
ins tuted important changes impac ng underrecoveries on high speed diesel hsd for the public sector companies in
india which beginning january 2013 were empowered to determine the retail selling prices of motor spirit ms while
in the case of hsd they have been given the freedom to hike the selling price every month by a small amount of around
50 paisa a liter also the selling prices of hsd for bulk consumers have been fully deregulated these changes however
could also impact demand and lead to greater compe       on from private sector players in the future
the government has also implemented other key changes impac ng the lpg business with a view to limit the subsidy
burden a cap has been placed on the number of subsidised lpg cylinder that every lpg consumer can get in a ﬁnancial
year eﬀorts are also on to weed out mul ple connec ons with a single consumer the government of india has also
introduced a system of directly credi ng the subsidy on lpg cylinder to the bank account of the consumer
the demand for petroleum products in the country depends signiﬁcantly on the economic growth in the country the
countrys economic growth could be aﬀected which in turn can lead to reduc on in the energy demand and in par cular
for oil and gas the price of crude oil in the interna onal market remains vola le although oil prices have reduced in the
interna onal markets the weakening rupee has eroded a major part of the gains in this situa on any slowdown in key
sectors of the economy can have a major impact on companies like bpcl
the government has also proposed introducing changes in the method of compu ng the under recoveries on products
that are currently being compensated for hsd lpg domes c and sko domes c as well as sensi ve petroleum
products due to their sale at controlled prices which are lower than costs any such change carries the risk of adversely

at our reﬁneries we focus on value maximiza on through process improvement technological innova on and
adop on of latest technologies real me process monitoring through advanced it systems and strengthening of
human capital to key factors for success
we aim to achieve highly safe and reliable opera on which would result in signiﬁcant loss control reliability of
processes and systems are ensured through frequent riskbased inspec ons rbi and reliability centered
maintenance rcm in the last year we also implemented the bpmi system which is management portal for data
analy cs these and other advanced process controls have enabled an increase in the up mes to more than 95
energy and carbon management are considered key elements for opera onal eﬃciency and cost savings in reﬁnery
this year we have undertaken a study though shell global solu ons to iden fy interven on areas pinch analysis and
technology mapping are carried out to iden fy and implement energy eﬃcient technologies we have met our target to
cover 30 ci es where we provide euro iv products and are now gearing towards covering 50 ci es in the next ﬁnancial
year bpcl has received 539 mmt crude from bombay high this year this would play a key role in reducing the carbon
footprint of the product during crude transporta on with over 375 mmt being allocated for mumbai reﬁnery
of more than 50 products in our en re por olio three products are regulated and the rest deregulated we target to
improve the produc on of high value products through employee sensi za on and improved opera ng prac ces
technological interven ons such as advanced process control are being used to maximize the yield and proﬁtability of
our opera ons our coherent eﬀort has resulted in reducing crude handling losses by about 005 which brought the
overall loss below 02
going forward we aim to focus on channeling the learning from the carbon footprin ng exercise undertaken during
previous years and developing a roadmap for carbon management we also foresee that the human capital age gaps
and succession planning can be some of the challenges going forward and are important aspects that will need to be
managed

                                   natural gas in indias energy basket is set to increase from the current 10 to about
                                   15 in the coming 5 to 7 years as per present es mates considering this change in
                                   the energy scenario in the country bpcl is geared up to capitalize on this
                                   opportunity the biggest consumers in india of natural gas are the fer lizer and
                                   power sectors these sectors consume approximately 70 of the natural gas that is
                                supplied bpcl is also a consumer of natural gas and we plan to use more of this fuel
in the mumbai and kochi reﬁneries to increase the opera onal eﬃciency and also reduce the environmental impacts of
our opera ons
reforms expected in some of the sectors in the coming years are likely to increase usage of lng in our country the
current lng pricing may also be impacted either ways in coming years while on one side the increasing complexi es of
explora on and produc on are likely to push up the costs on the other hand changes in supply and demand are likely to
so en the selling prices in the asian markets to some extent the major factor that has changed the supply dynamics is
us turning from net importer to net exporter with the shale gas revolu on the henry hub linked us gas imports into
asian markets are expected to be at lower prices than compared to tradi onal oil linked prices as per present trends
however it is very diﬃcult to predict the future movement of henry hub and crude prices with certainty with more
countries expected to exploit their shale reserves in the coming years we could see shi s in lng demand and some re
alignment of lng prices regionally
to meet the growing gas demand in the country the government of india is also encouraging the indigenous produc on
of natural gas while eﬀorts are being made by indian companies to secure lng from overseas suppliers bpcl has
entered into few long term sourcing agreements through its jv petronet lng ltd it is also planning to secure more
supplies for future through the jv or directly to secure a reasonable share of indian lng imports at compe       ve prices
bpcl has been successful in its explora on pursuits and are partners in one of the major gas discoveries in mozambique
which could be an important source of gas supplies for the indian market
to get to a level of sustainable supply posi on securing the long term contracts it is also necessary to have capacity for
regasiﬁca on and transporta on by pipelines
bpcl has therefore taken ac on towards securing the regasiﬁca on capacity in the lng terminals of pll and also
exploring op ons at other ports being developed bpcl is also a copromoter of jvcs developing three cross country gas
pipelines to take the gas to the consump on centers from the import and produc on centers apart from u lizing the
exis ng pipeline networks by entering into the transmission agreements
thus having presence in the upstream in terms of gas produc on and liquefac on and tying up sourcing regasiﬁca on
capacity and pipeline capacity bpcl plans to provide gas as one of the energy solu ons to our esteemed customers

the primary stakeholders for the business are airlines airport operators and other oil companies 67 of the sbus
business results from interna onal airlines and 33 is from domes c airlines including defense requirements the
business has 3 services  pure fuel supplier we supply and buy from iocl at certain airports infrastructure operator at
airports and direct fuelling of planes safety being paramount the amount of me taken to fuel the aircra is one of the
most important performance indicator for our business
we believe that a focus on sustainability can allow companies to diﬀeren ate themselves in the marketplace gain an
edge over the compe tors thus serving as a business enabler given the nature of the industry where the product itself
is standardized success and growth for our business depends on  pricing services and rela onship while all oil
companies may meet the quality standards required by their customers and have li le inﬂuence on the commodity
prices sustainability helps us diﬀeren ate ourselves from the compe tors by focusing on the issues most relevant for
our business such as customer service and product innova on
one of our key ini a ve focusing on environmental impact mi ga on is the addi on of an addi ve to the diesel
operated vehicles at fuelling sta ons afss to reduce smoke by 3 the avia on fuelling sta ons also have in place
deﬁned water management prac ces at the gwalior air force afs they have ba ery operated carts for fuelling last
year they expanded the number from 1 to 5 this is not possible at big airports as a diﬀerent system hydrant based is
used instead of the fuel cart travelling to each aircra  at big airports in future they may look at using the same for
dispenser vehicles we focus on working with the airports to iden fy the systems best suited to the condi ons for
eﬃcient fueling
the opera ons of the sbu are audited by the airline customers interna onal business for the sbu means more
business per fuelling as the aircra s are larger than the domes c aircra s resul ng in a lower fuelling business per
aircra  it is in our interest to focus on the quality an other key sustainability considera ons of our customers and our
con nued focus in this area has resulted in the business receiving good feedback from clients on safety and quality we

capacity of kochi reﬁnery by 6 mmtpa from the present 95 mmtpa to 155 mmtpa and modernize the reﬁnery to
produce auto fuels conforming to euroiv  v speciﬁca ons and upgrada on of the residue streams vacuum residue
from the reﬁnery to dis llates and petcoke
2 capacity augmenta on of kotapiyala sec on of mmbpl pipeline the project envisages enhancement of capacity of
the kotapiyala sec on of mumbaimanmadmangliapiyalabijwasan pipeline from 28 mmtpa to 44 mmtpa to
evacuate products from bina reﬁnery and also to meet the growing demands in the northern region
3 product pipeline from kota to jobner the project envisages laying of 14 dia and 210 km long cross country pipeline

from kota to jobner for the movement of msskohsd from bpcl mumbai reﬁnery borl at a cost of 27627 crore
inclusive of 1567 crore interest during construc on june 2010 prices

risk management across the value chain
almost 75 of crude oil requirement of bpcl reﬁneries at mumbai and kochi is met through imported crude the huge
quan ty of crude oil 17 million metric tons imported in a year exposes the company to diﬀerent risks in transporta on
of crude oil from the load port to disports and ﬁnally its processing in reﬁneries
during one instance a tanker loaded with 95000 tons of crude oil reported at mumbai during rough weather condi ons
within a few minutes of commencement of cargo discharge opera on the vessel was exposed to strong currents of the
sea and the moorings started ge ng snapped one of the marine loading arm through which the ship was discharging
the cargo broke away causing the vessel to immediately suspend the opera ons and close all the valves to prevent
marine pollu on the vessel was pulled out from the berth and placed at outer anchorage as the parcel of 95000 tons
crude could not be oﬄoaded from the ship reﬁnery was running the risk of nil stock
the following alterna ve sources had to be immediately tapped with an immediate eﬀect
  eﬀorts were made on war foo ng basis to ensure availability of crude oil to reﬁnery from alterna ve source
  in view of low stock of high sulphur crude cdu1 was temporarily shut down however other plants con nued their
opera ons with mumbai high crude
  the other vessels which were wai ng to berth at je y no 4 were either diverted to kochi reﬁnery or they were
lightered into another vessel in order to accommodate small parcels at je y no 1 and je y no 3
this ensured that the reﬁnery opera ons are not aﬀected in any way and the petroleum products are made available to
the endcustomers without any disrup on
bpcl takes good deal of care at each step of its value chain to ensure that the risks and losses are contained or
minimised to the bare minimum alterna ve sources are ac vated and put in place and eﬀec ve remedial ac on is taken
to prevent recurrence of such incidents in future

bkpl is the 259 km long mul product cross country pipeline from bina reﬁnery to kota terminal used for the
evacua on of msskohsd produc on of bina reﬁnery a daily power failure of 12 to 18 hours at the loca on of the sv
loca ons in madhya pradesh and rajasthan was posing a risk to reliable con nuous power supply to all 7 sv sta ons is
essen al for smooth and safe opera on of pipeline this resulted in the use of dg sets installed at sv sta ons as
emergency power backup
the use of the dg sets posed an environmental hazard while also exposing the opera ons to mul ple risks including the
nonfunc oning of telecom panel scada panels cathodic protec on systems intermi ent power failures and
escala on of hidden costs

sec onalizing valve sta ons sv1 to sv7 solar power system of 48 volts dc  64 kwp capaci es each was installed to
meet power requirements of the seven sv sta ons
this resulted in the use of the exis ng dg sets only as an emergency backup source as per the design standard this also
reduced the environment pollu on caused by the use of dg sets the use of solar power would result in the savings of
inr 18 lakhs per year this would con nue for the next 20 years

     disclosure on management approach environmental performance
     we recognize that our business can have a signiﬁcant impact on the environment and have robust
     environmental management systems in place to avoid harmful consequences of our opera ons our focus
     con nues to be on minimizing the nega ve impacts of our opera ons and going beyond we have managed to
     reduce our strain on natural resources through various resource and opera onal eﬃciency measures we are
     extremely conscious of the cri cality of water as a resource for the community and con nuity of our opera ons
     we are commi ed to manage our water usage in a responsible manner we lay a lot of emphasis on reducing our
     energy consump on and ghg emissions which is evident from our performance over the years we have also
     been exploring opportuni es in the ﬁeld of renewable energy we have stringent processes to monitor our air
     emissions and eﬄuents
     responsible environmental management in our opera ons over the years has had a huge inﬂuence on our
     growth path it has not only helped us in gaining access to new resources but has also helped us in op mizing our
     management of risks all our business units are working dedicatedly towards a common goal of minimizing our
     environmental impact and have taken up measures to address the environmental risks speciﬁc to them we
     believe con nuous improvement in our environmental performance is impera ve to the sustainability of our
     opera ons


energy utilization
climate change is a signiﬁcant challenge for our business it is a well established fact that energy and climate change are
inextricably linked as a signiﬁcant consumer of energy we too have a role to play in contribu ng to global greenhouse
gas emission reduc ons it also makes longterm business sense for us to invest in energy security and cost reduc on as
these are key drivers for our growth climate change thus also presents us with poten al opportuni es it creates
possibili es for us to gain compe   ve advantage by inves ng in low emission technologies and demonstrate leadership
as with material use the reﬁneries are responsible for a signiﬁcant share of the total energy used for our opera ons
some of the key primary energy sources used in our reﬁneries are diesel fuel oil fo naphtha and lng our reﬁneries
consumed 618 million gj of direct energy including 727 gj of renewable energy produced using solar power at the
kochi reﬁnery our indirect energy consump on was 322000 gj in the repor ng period
the total direct energy consumed by our other sbus amounted to 934109 gj of which more than 10 was generated
through renewable sources like solar and wind also the total indirect energy consumed by our other business units
stood at 260054 gj


934109 gj this ﬁgure includes the energy used for boiler oil which was not reported in our last years report this
 change in calcula on results in the reported energy consump on ﬁgure for this year being signiﬁcantly higher than
 the same ﬁgure reported for the previous years

water utilization
water is a ﬁnite and increasingly scarce resource it is not only vital for the sustenance of our opera ons but also for the
community and access to it is a basic human right we are well aware of the need to use this extremely cri cal resource
prudently our installa ons are widely spread across the country and some of them are situated in water stressed zones
as iden ﬁed by the government of india thus it is impera ve for us to have a long term outlook towards water
management
the type of water source used depends on the loca ons of our units the major sources of water are surface water
ground water and municipal supplies and our use is guided by the regulatory permits on resources allocated from
speciﬁc water sources for our opera ons the total water consumed by our reﬁneries in the repor ng period was 3752
million cubic meters which represents over 10 reduc on over the last year despite the increase in throughput also
more than 84 of mumbai reﬁnerys water requirement is being met by sea water our other business units consumed
109 million cubic meters of water
we are constantly seeking opportuni es to minimize our burden on the fresh water resources we have sitespeciﬁc
water conserva on plans and water intensity targets as demands for water vary from site to site recycling of waste
water has been systemically implemented across our loca ons our opera ons have also made signiﬁcant investment
on rain water harves ng in the last year

     we are in the process of undertaking a comprehensive study to evaluate the water footprint across all our
    opera ons and iden fy water intensive opera ons as well as water risks at speciﬁc loca ons to priori ze water

our energy use at reﬁneries and other sbus accounts for the majority of our ghg emissions the total ghg emissions
from our reﬁneries were 418 million tonnes co₂ equivalent our total ghg emissions decreased as compared to last
year despite the increase in throughput in reﬁneries the total ghg emissions per unit of throughput showed a
reduc on of 323 over the last year the indirect ghg emissions from our reﬁneries resul ng from purchased
electricity was 007 million tonnes of co₂ equivalent the total direct and indirect ghg emissions from our other
business units were 63876 tonnes of co₂ equivalent and 56345 tonnes of co₂ equivalent respec vely the total indirect
ghg emissions from our other business units saw a 1384 reduc on over previous year
we plan to expand the scope of measurement of our exis ng ghg accoun ng studies to also assess the impact of
product and raw material transport on our ghg emissions and we will commence repor ng on this from fy 201415

  sunpipe a natural way of room illumina on
  the system of harnessing sunlight for room illumina on was introduced for the ﬁrst me in bpcl by pipelines group
  as a green ini a ve for energy saving
  the advantages of this system are many including uv protected light reduced seasonal aﬀec ve disorder problem
  minimiza on of heat losses in the winter this installa on does not require maintenance and modiﬁca on of
  structural altera ons this system is eﬀec ve even in sunny overcast and rainy condi ons the key components of
  the system include glazing lining and ceiling diﬀuser
  one of the highlights of sunpipe is that it has the poten al to replace the use of ar ﬁcial lights for room illumina on
  completely during day me


the majority of other signiﬁcant air emissions result from our reﬁnery opera ons we have installed advance
monitoring sta ons at reﬁneries to monitor air emissions we measure sulphur dioxide so₂ oxides of nitrogen nox
carbon monoxide co respirable par culate ma er rpm 10 and other meteorological data and ensure that the
emissions are well within the permissible limits speciﬁed on our regulatory permitsthe total sox and nox emissions in
the repor ng period at our reﬁneries amounted to 13155 tonnes and 1427 tonnes respec vely
we have signiﬁcantly reduced our ozone deple ng substance ods emissions and are well on track of completely
phasing out ods from our opera ons in 201213 our reﬁneries consumed 5 tonnes of r22 gas resul ng in ods

waste management
our opera ons generate a wide variety of waste some of which could poten ally have a nega ve impact on the
environment depending on the type of waste being generated every loca on has a waste management strategy in
place we priori ze reducing the waste being generated through opera onal eﬃciency as what is not generated does
not have to be treated we also have plans in place to reuse recycle and properly dispose of waste ensuring eﬀec ve
management of waste is necessary to avoid poten al cleanup cost later on our reﬁneries are the signiﬁcant
contributors to the total waste generated from our opera ons with minor contribu ons from the lubes and lpg sbus
our reﬁneries generated 1540224 tonnes of waste in 201213 of which almost 69 was nonhazardous disposal of
our waste is done through cer ﬁed vendors who are authorized by pollu on control board all the nonhazardous waste
is sold to the designated contractors and the hazardous waste is disposed oﬀ to the secured landﬁlls using speciﬁed
methods the residual sludge a er oil recovery is treated using bioremedia on our lpg bo ling plants and lubes
