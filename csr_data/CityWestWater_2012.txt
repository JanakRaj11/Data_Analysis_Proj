related revenues
total borrowings increased by 234 per cent 1424m during 201112 mainly to fund the required capital expenditure to
support growth in our licence area as well as investment in the companys existing infrastructure assets at the same time

bulk water purchased for the year was 963 gigalitres gl compared to last years 926 gl an increase of 4 per cent

retailers south east water and yarra valley water also become statutory corporations on this date the entities governing
legislation changes from the water industry act 1994 vic to the water act 1989 vic while the change in form
is not expected to have a significant impact on the companys operations it is expected that the water retailers will be provided
with additional revenue collection powers the extent of these additional collection powers will be regulated by the essential
services commission esc it is expected that the esc will issue a draft customer code in coming months as part of its
consultation process
city west water has completed the enterprise design and release one design phases of its business transformation program

disposal of sewage currently supplied by the melbourne water corporation during the financial year 201112 all drinking water
