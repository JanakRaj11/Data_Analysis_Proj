bruno maestri
corporate sustainability officer


bruno maestri was named norfolk southerns corporate sustainability officer in june 2015 based in
ns washington office maestri also is vice president government relations a former environmental
consultant he joined the railroad in 1995 as chief environmental officer


q what is your role as corporate sustainability officer
a my primary role is to lead initiatives demonstrating how sustainability is embedded in the
    companys culture the aim is to connect our sustainability goals with our strategic corporate
    goals and to the daytoday work of our employees also its telling the story of how norfolk
    southern interacts in sustainable ways with our shareholders customers and the communities
    we serve to me corporate sustainability means acting responsibly in the conduct of our business
    this can only enhance our ability to grow business

q what is your top sustainability priority over the next year or so
a priority one is to get a deeper more formal understanding of what is most material to norfolk
    southern and our key internal and external stakeholders in terms of sustainability from that
    assessment we can refine our areas of focus and help employees better understand the important
    role they each play in making the railroad and the communities where we live and work stronger
    and more sustainable we are part of the fabric of the communities where we operate and we
    want to add value by what norfolk southern brings to our communities




                                                                                                         4

q as you think about sustainability trends within the broader society what do you view as the
    greatest opportunities and challenges facing ns

a there is much discussion in washington about climate change and the need to reduce carbon
    emissions studies show that freight rail is four times more fuelefficient on average than trucks
    on the highway and generates 75 percent fewer carbon emissions per ton of freight by encouraging
    the movement of more goods by rail instead of longhaul trucks society actually can reduce the
    overall carbon footprint from transportation sources thats one of our big opportunities the
    challenge is to establish a mechanism where rail gets credit in some manner for lowering overall
    emissions  even if total rail emissions go up some percentage as a result of moving higher business
    volumes its important that those who regulate or score carbon emissions recognize the role that
    rail plays in reducing total transportationrelated emissions

q do you think norfolk southern could ever reach a point where it runs a carbon neutral operation
a as we continue to grow business offsetting our total footprint would be very challenging but
    conceptually its possible weve adopted technologies and operational practices that over the
    past five years have helped us reduce carbon emissions by more than 8 percent per revenue tonmile
    of freight our trees and trains carbon mitigation program creates carbon credits sufficient to offset
    co₂ emissions in a meaningful way over time in the mississippi delta a region important to our
    business our trees and trains partnership with greentrees has reforested 10000 acres with more
    than 6 million trees and is expected to earn carbon credits equivalent to offsetting nearly a
    quarter of norfolk southerns annual co₂ emissions thats significant we could pursue other
    carbonmitigation initiatives if they make sense from a business perspective in addition developing
    a mechanism whereby carbon credits could be earned for converting freight from highway to rail
    could make a substantial impact on offsetting our emissions

q what are the next steps ns needs to take to advance the companys sustainability journey
a its to focus on the things that matter most to us and were well on the way with those steps
    locomotive fuel efficiency is one critical area in 2015 senior management adopted a strategic plan
    that for the first time creates a publicly stated goal to reduce fuel consumption over the next five
    years this is key to our ongoing efforts to reduce carbon emissions in a second critical area we
    are taking steps to more effectively manage the large fleet of vehicles our people need to operate
    and maintain the railroad that initiative includes the use of telematics technology to enhance driver
    safety fuel economy and operational costs a third critical area is improving energy use in our facilities
    across our network were upgrading facilities with more energyefficient lighting and other technolo
    gies to make them smarter greener and less expensive to operate our 53million energyconversion
    project at juniata locomotive shop is a good example with facilities across 22 states this is a major
    undertaking that requires identification prioritization and investment it wont happen all at once but
    we are committed to the task and focused on making progress one step at a time




               we are part of the fabric of the communities where we
                 operate and we want to add value by what norfolk
                        southern brings to our communities

jim squires
chairman president and ceo

thanks for visiting norfolk southerns 2016 sustainability report and for your interest in learning
more about what efficiency looks like at our railroad

efficiently moving freight trains across our 22state network is a cornerstone of sustainability at
norfolk southern its about turning challenges into daily opportunities  keeping our people and
communities safe providing unequalled customer service and being a good steward of the resources
that contribute to our success as a business enterprise providing reliable costefficient and environ
mentally friendly rail service ensures that we remain a vital link in the nations freight transportation
network for years to come efficiently moving the goods that keep our economy moving

in the nine years since norfolk southern adopted a formal sustainability program  we were the
first large us railroad to appoint a corporate sustainability officer  we have embedded sustainable
practices into our corporate strategy we recognize that sustainability is not something you just bolt
on to be most impactful sustainability has to be entwined in daily operations in ways that advance our
business goals and honor our environmental and social commitments as a responsible corporate citizen

examples of how we achieve that balance are found in this report in 2015 for instance we rolled out
a new class of lowemission eco locomotives recycling older frames to save on costs while helping
communities comply with their commitments and obligations under the federal clean air act



           efficiently moving freight trains across our 22state network
               is a cornerstone of sustainability at norfolk southern

        for the first time we adopted a locomotive fuelefficiency goal setting a 2020 target to reduce diesel
        consumption equal to 80 million annually achieving that goal will help us meet another key objective 
        lowering greenhouse gas emissions from locomotive operations our biggest environmental impact to
        reduce that impact we are investing in enginehandling technologies an innovative locomotive rebuild
        program and network efficiencies that in turn reduce our bottomline expenses

        norfolk southern also made gains in social performance in 2015 workplace injuries declined as we
        introduced a new safety theme i am coming home that makes safety personal for the second
        consecutive year we hired record numbers of women in our management trainee and conductor
        trainee programs along with that we formed employee diversity and inclusion councils in each of the
        companys 10 operating divisions recognizing that our future success depends on recruiting a
        workforce that reflects the diversity of the communities we serve

        since my appointment as ceo in 2015 norfolk southern has adopted a fiveyear strategic plan that
        further integrates sustainability into business operations the plan focuses on the three pillars of our
        business model safety and service stewardship of resources through operating efficiencies and growth
        to be sustainable as a business enterprise we have to deliver on each of these strategic priorities

        with a business history approaching two centuries we realize that meeting the service needs of our
        customers is the key to longevity by operating safely we help ensure a successful future for our
        customers our communities and ourselves

        under our corporate umbrella we are stewards of many resources our people our physical assets and
        all the goods and services that we consume as a business given the large resource footprint that is
        characteristic of our company and the rail industry  the tracks trains and facilities across our operating
        territory  it is critical that we remain focused on being a conscientious caretaker of those resources

        norfolk southern traces its roots to a small railroad in south carolina that began operating in the 1830s
        the earliest days of railroading now as we embrace the challenges and opportunities of a 21st century
        global marketplace we are committed to achieving industry leadership in sustainability we want to be
        a good steward of the environment and drive our business forward at the same time a formula that
        spells success for us and for our key stakeholders  investors customers employees communities
        suppliers industry partners and government agencies

taking steps to improve customer service
from yard expansions and innovative technologies to a new locomotive reliability team norfolk
southern in 2015 continued to take action that improves customer service and the companys
longterm sustainability

the following are highlights

moorman yard expansion
norfolk southern began implementing network changes to
take advantage of a 160 million expansion completed in late
2014 that nearly doubled the size of moorman yard in
bellevue ohio now capable of handling 3000 rail cars daily
the facility has enabled ns to reduce car handling and switch
ing route miles and delivery times  by as much as two days
for some customers

the bellevue terminal ns largest hump classification yard
is strategically located along a rail corridor that connects
consumerrich markets between chicago and new york the
expansion has enabled ns to consolidate car handlings into
fewer yards and to build longer trains in one measure of efficiency gains car handlings in 2015 were
reduced by nearly 200 cars a day generating annualized savings approaching 14 million

bellevues added capacity has created opportunities to grow business volumes across ns northern
region and in other key network hubs it also has improved network resiliency providing more
flexibility to reroute traffic and minimize delays during winter storms affecting chicago and the
northern region

more intermodal capacity
ns intermodal network links shippers to supply chains that span the globe providing safe fast and
efficient rail service to ocean carriers thirdparty logistics firms truckload lessthantruckload and
parcel carriers as intermodal volumes grow ns continues to improve processes employ innovative
                                           technologies and make strategic capital investments to
                                           increase capacity and enhance service

                                         in 2015 ns completed an expansion of its rutherford intermodal
                                         facility near harrisburg pa adding new loading unloading and
                                         support tracks and increasing parking capacity to handle more
                                         traffic volumes

                                         ns also completed improvements to its calumet intermodal
                                         facility in chicago including adding a lift track support track
                                         capacity and parking these enhancements improve ns

industryleading technologies
ns began rolling out technology upgrades in 2015 that make
doing business with the railroad easier and faster the single
largest effort scheduled for completion in early 2017 involves a
redesign of accessns the companys main customer ecommerce
portal another significant initiative is the railroads new optimized
intermodal terminal operating system including an industryfirst
mobile app for drayage truckers at automotive distribution
facilities ns began installing a hightech optical scanning system
that gives auto customers and drayage drivers a realtime view
of vehicle shipments

to ensure these nextgeneration technologies meet customer
needs ns put customers in the drivers seat the company used customer surveys recruited shipping
company volunteers for input on user experience and rode along with drayage truckers at ns intermodal
facilities in chicago and atlanta to better understand their needs and concerns

                                            expressns mobile app speeds business for intermodal shippers
                                            in 2015 norfolk southern introduced expressns an industry
                                            first mobile phone app that speeds truck drivers pickup and
                                            delivery of trailers and containers at ns intermodal facilities

cameras and optical scanners for faster more efficient processing of drayage trucks

teaming up for locomotive reliability
a new locomotive reliability group formed in 2015 has one mission to keep locomotives on the road
and out of repair shops based in atlanta a group of four teams helps mechanical shop employees
diagnose locomotive troubles and reduce repeat locomotive failures

ns based the concept in part on a model developed by delta air lines to assist its airplane mechanics
with repairs locomotives have event recorders  similar to an airplanes black box  that shop
personnel can download and send to the reliability teams to troubleshoot problems each team
specializes in one of ns four primary road locomotive models

the reliability teams spend their days studying the circuitry
the computers and the systems on one model of locomotive
 they know every nut and bolt and wire said doug corbin
ns assistant vice president mechanical they help those
local mechanics dig down to the bottom of the problem

since forming the group ns has seen a drop in repeat
locomotive failures and an increase in the mean days between
repairshop visits for individual locomotives each team has
developed standardized work procedures that provide a
checklist for shop employees to follow when a locomotive
arrives for repair and before it reenters service




                                                                                                               25

investing in reliable pulling power
norfolk southern is making significant investments to
improve the reliability of its locomotive fleet these
initiatives include

 a rebuild program to convert aging dash 9 locomotives
  from dc to ac power a process that transforms the
  1990s and early 2000s units into likenew locomotives
  at about half the cost of buying new using acpowered
  traction motors boosts the locomotives pulling power
  particularly at slow speeds and enhances fuel efficiency
  ns owns about 1200 of the dash 9s currently compris
  ing nearly half of the railroads longhaul road fleet

 a plan to purchase 50 new ac locomotives including 47 units in 2016 equipped with tier 4 emissions
  technology meeting epas latest and most stringent emissions standards ge transportation the
  locomotive manufacturer says the highperformance locomotives cut emissions of nitrogen oxides
  and particulate matter by at least 70 percent compared with tier 3 locomotives  one more way that
  ns helps customers reduce their supplychain emissions

        a more personal approach the company introduced i am
        coming home as a new brand for its safety program as part of
        the campaign all operations employees received a handwritten
        notecard from ns chief operating officer with this message

        i want you to go home to your family every day safely and i
        want them to know that at ns safety means that you are coming
        home what could be more important than getting home to
        our families and loved ones safely every day

        commonplace ongoing employee engagement includes videos
        with key safety messages and employees sharing stories about
        working safely ns has incorporated the brand into its safety
        vision statement we get home safe every day no job is so
        important and no service is so urgent that we cannot take the
        time to perform our work safely

             taking risk into account
             in 2015 norfolk southern introduced risk factor training
             workshops that help operations employees recognize and
             safely manage risks they encounter daily

             the interactive workshops  a full day for supervisors and
             a half day for craft employees  feature a threestep safety
             tool called pause process and proceed employees pause to
             assess potential risks of a work task process how to perform
             the task safely and effectively and then proceed in the safest
             way possible

             ns and dupont sustainable solutions developed the training dupont trained more than 270 supervisors
             to lead workshops for craft employees the training complements ns behaviorbased safety program
             which emphasizes positive reinforcement and coaching to promote safe work behaviors

             the risk factor training acknowledges that creating another safety rule might not be the answer
             to preventing all injuries said jeremy bush an assistant terminal superintendent who teaches the
                                           workshop to locomotive engineers and conductors our train and engine
                                           crews are very open to hearing that because its not as authoritative were
                                           actively involved in a twoway conversation about risks and how we can
                                           make good choices for our safety every day

                                         the goal is to help employees reduce injuries through a deliberate
                                         decisionmaking process that starts by acknowledging that risk exists
                                         said mike armstrong a trainmaster and workshop instructor
recognizing risk
                                         own your decisions armstrong told train crews during a workshop at
pause process proceed is a
new safety tool introduced to the        crewe va what you do out here affects you your coworkers and your
workforce during 2015                   families the public wants to know that the people operating a train through
                                         their neighborhood are doing it safely


             ns ergonomics enhancing safety efficiency and the bottom line
             norfolk southerns ergonomics program encourages employee innovation teamwork and problem
             solving to enhance workplace safety and efficiency employee successes are showcased in the annual
             ergo cup competition in 2015 the competition drew 26 entries from mechanical department shops
             and 10 from engineering department teams

             the winning teams made improvements to equipment and work processes
             that eliminated manual lifting reduced the time required to perform tasks
             and saved on operating costs the winning engineering team for example
             designed a rail stabilizer carrier now being used by bridge maintenance crews
             systemwide in addition to ergonomic benefits the carrier boosts the companys
             bottom line by reducing track downtime during bridge maintenance

             we try to get a domino effect with the ergo cup entries said don robinson       2015 ergo cup winners

norfolk southern owns and maintains a fleet of around 6000 light medium and heavyduty trucks suvs
and cars that employees use in field operations that number ranks ns as a top 100 commercial
fleet to enhance workplace safety improve use and reduce maintenance costs the company is
using telematics technology to monitor driving behaviors

a 2015 pilot program equipped 100 vehicles with the technology
which uses gps and mobile cellular to track instances of hard
braking hard acceleration speeding above the posted limit
and excessive speeding employees were issued scorecards
and performance improved across all metrics in 2016 ns
plans to outfit an additional 2600 vehicles with telematics

were constantly working to enhance safety at norfolk
southern and this is another tool were putting in the toolbox
said mike waits system manager vehicle fleet administration
the more cautious and conscientious you are driving at work
the more that cascades to safer driving when its your spouse
or children in the vehicle with you

in addition to safety ns is using the technology to reduce unnecessary vehicle idling which will contribute
to the companys fuel and emissionsreduction goals during the pilot employees achieved a 4 percent
improvement overall in fuel economy in 2015 ns vehicle fleet consumed more than 12 million gallons
of fuel at a cost of nearly 31 million  trimming 4 percent off the bill would save more than 1 million

when youre talking about spending millions of dollars on fuel even small reductions make an impact
waits said in a sustainability sense its not just reduced consumption but reduced emissions too

our culture and to make everyone realize that we can
come from all over the world but basically were all
the same said rajshree doshi technology analyst

many employees wore traditional indian clothing including such nonindians as fred ehlers vice
president it ehlers attending his second diwali event said the atlanta celebration is special because
it is an employee initiative

this is the best kind of diversity event because it happened on its own without prompting from the
company ehlers said it grew organically from a group of folks who share their culture and their
heritage with the rest of us its a great time to meet and interact with your coworkers

      advances in employee development
      in 2015 the company advanced efforts to enhance training and career development opportunities for
      new hires and seasoned employees

      following are the most significant accomplishments

      norfolk southern training center
      located in mcdonough ga the facility provides centralized technical training for newly hired
      craft employees and advanced training programs for veteran and supervisory employees in march
      ns completed a new classroom addition that doubled instructional space to 50000 square feet
      and equipped the facility with the latest in digital learning technologies including touchscreens
      smart boards tablets and customized computer simulations

      the upgrade also enhanced environmental sustainability
      the centers new virtual welding lab for example enables ns to teach the basics of freight car welding
      virtually instead of consuming stacks of metal burn plates the computersimulated welder training
      provides physical auditory and visual feedback and actually accelerates training

ns also began introducing enhancements to its conductor trainee program improvements in 2015
included the addition of static competency stations that expand handson training in such work tasks
as mounting and dismounting equipment securing rail car hand brakes and coupling air hoses the
aim is to make the training program more efficient and reduce the amount of time needed to qualify
conductors this addresses a business need to improve resource allocation in response to changing
business markets and traffic volumes

learning management system
ns launched a new online learning management system that makes it easier than ever for employees
to access training and develop and advance their careers

the new lms consolidates training programs formerly housed on separate systems into a onestop shopping
place that allows employees to browse training topics complete online courses and track their learning
in addition employees receive automatic email notification of required training based on job position
department and other criteria recommended for various job roles to help employees be successful

the lms is a bestinclass system said dan mackay director employee development it gives the
company much more capability to deliver and track training and it gives employees a much more
efficient way to explore and take advantage of the training opportunities we offer

implementing the lms as the single corporate standard mackay said reduces the companys operational
costs in addition to streamlining the training process for employees

employee spotlight
stephen young building a tradition of volunteering
before joining norfolk southern in 1999 stephen young had never been involved in community volunteer
work now young manager intermodal equipment is a fixture with the norfolk thoroughbred volunteers
he has twice earned volunteer of the year award for most volunteer hours and has chaired the group for
the past year

a favorite project of his is the annual hampton roads family
volunteer day a halfday foodpacking event to assist local
charities young and his daughter amber have made it a family
tradition participating together for the past 15 years  since
amber now in college was five years old

for the 2015 event norfolk southern employees who work in
the 21story headquarters building collected canned foods by
floors as part of a competition young helped organize over
thanksgiving weekend the fatherdaughter team joined more
than 1000 local volunteers to pack nonperishable food items
for 14 nonprofits ranging from homeless shelters to food banks

initially young said his motive for getting amber involved was
to help her develop a history of volunteer work for college
applications and job resumes now both are hooked on
volunteering for its own sake

we caught the spirit he said we love experiencing the benefit of seeing joy on peoples faces

young hopes to make family volunteer day a multigenerational tradition the company introduced
me to it i introduced my daughter to it and id like to introduce my grandchildren one day he said
we feel good when we volunteer and we know were lucky to be in a position to be able to do it


                i think its important for us all to give back and show
                our support for the initiatives our communities have

respond to potential incidents involving crude oil transport ns sponsored emergency responders
from communities where crude oil trains operate including responders from indiana ohio pennsylvania
illinois new jersey maryland and delaware


ns safety train reflects commitment to communities
in 2015 norfolk southern launched its operation awareness  response program to cultivate and
strengthen relationships with local first responders  and to educate the public about the economic
benefits of moving hazardous materials by rail the program provides classroom online and field training
on hazardous materials transport and useful information about rail operations

in april 2016 ns rolled out the programs centerpiece a hazmat safety train the company also
launched a new website httpwwwjoinnsoarcom

           1   introduced the eco locomotive a locomotive rebuild program that recycles older locomotives
                and outfits them with new lowemission engines
           2   rolled out the sleeper an engineheater system that eliminates unnecessary locomotive idling
                in winter months

             reducing life cycle emissions
             the eco locomotives were developed through ns unique rebuild program that recycles older locomo
             tive bodies and upgrades engines with newer technologies that maximize fuel economy and emissions
             reduction for the eco units ns used the body frames of a locomotive model built in the 1980s and
             equipped them with new lowemission engines

             recycling the older locomotives rather than buying newly manufactured steel components adds to
             the programs benefits by reducing productionrelated carbon emissions and lowering costs

                                         to enhance emissions reduction each eco unit can replace two older

stakeholder collaboration and innovation
norfolk southern fieldtested the sleeper system in 2013 at one of its chicago yards collaboration
with suppliers produced an innovative design easy for train crews to use for example the power
station features a retractable power crane equipped with a night light and other safety features the
crane went through four generations of design to perfect it

weve standardized that design across our system ns essentially created a market for the power
crane said bruce backus electrical engineer locomotive design

during the chicago field trials the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen and the united
transportation union  unions representing train and engine crews at ns  contributed to improve

     setting a goal on fuel efficiency
     norfolk southern in 2015 set a fiveyear goal to improve locomotive fuel efficiency as part of the companys
     strategic plan to reduce operating costs and improve the companys stewardship of resources

     the goal is to reduce fuel consumption by 80 million per year by 2020 to achieve it ns aims to improve
     overall locomotive fuel economy by nearly 9 percent from the 2015 baseline ns has fuelefficiency
     initiatives underway or in development to reach the goal they range from trainhandling technologies to
     operating strategies such as running longer trains which requires fewer locomotives and reduces fuel use

     ns efforts to improve fuel efficiency will contribute to its goal to reduce carbon emissions ns current
     goal expected to be updated in 2017 is to reduce ghg emissions by 10 percent per revenue tonmile
     based on 2009 emission levels

     weve been on a path of steady and consistent improvement in fuel efficiency going back several years
     said neville wilson director operations and locomotive control who leads ns fuel team we have
     initiatives in place that we believe can help us accelerate that progress

following are two of the fuel teams most significant efficiency initiatives

follow the leader
norfolk southerns main fuelefficiency program is leader a trainhandling technology that monitors
a trains operating conditions and calculates the speed and dynamic braking required for maximum
fuel efficiency train crews use an onboard touchscreen computer to operate the gpsbased
system ns has achieved average fuel savings of 5 to 7 percent on trains led by a leader
equipped locomotive

by the end of 2015 ns had equipped more than 1900 of its 2600 road locomotives  nearly
threefourths of the road fleet  with leader software and hardware in 2015 the number of trains
operating with leader more than doubled  to 50 percent of all road trains from 22 percent at the
end of 2014 during the year ns also completed employee training on use of leader involving
approximately 4400 locomotive engineers and 3900 conductors

in 2016 ns for the first time will begin using trip optimizer trainhandling technology developed by
industry partner ge transportation trip optimizer ges version of leader will be installed on 50 new
ge evolution locomotives ns plans to purchase ns also expects to install trip optimizer on older ge
locomotive models that receive engine upgrades through ns locomotive rebuild program

ns plan to buy new locomotives and its rebuild program  in particular an initiative to convert dc
tractionmotor locomotives to more efficient ac locomotives  support ns goal to lower the average
age of its locomotive fleet reducing the fleets age increases reliability and contributes to reduced fuel
consumption over time because fewer locomotives are out of service for repairs and maintenance
that means ns can operate a smaller locomotive fleet to meet business demands

matching horsepower with tonnage
beyond leader the most significant fuel conservation initiative is called horsepower per ton or hpt
developed during 2015 and rolled out in early 2016 hpt provides train crews with specific guidelines
on maximum locomotive horsepower to use based on train type total tonnage and direction

typically several locomotives are assigned to a train however rarely are they all needed for the entire
trip because horsepower demands vary based on terrain and other operating conditions hpt aims to
reduce the number of locomotives used during any segment of the trip

using fewer units is more efficient operationally and saves fuel development is underway to incorpo
rate hpt as an automatic feature of leader

were leveraging onboard technology gained by installing leader including gps and track map
information to enable us to remotely idle leaderequipped locomotives in real time if not needed for
pulling power wilson said this will make hpt even more dynamic as a fuelefficiency tool



    ns fuel economy by the numbers


   norfolk southern measures fuel efficiency in two ways by revenue tonmiles and by gross tonmiles

   revenue tonmiles fuel economy tied to revenue tonmiles or rtm is based on the
   tonnage of customers freight moved in revenue service in 2015 ns trains moved 1997 billion
   revenue tonmiles of freight while consuming more than 486 million gallons of locomotive diesel
   fuel on average ns moved a ton of freight 410 miles per gallon of diesel burned that com
   pares with 415 miles per gallon in 2014 a decline of 1 percent the decline is attributable largely
   to shifts in business mix weather and network traffic issues that resulted in congestion and
   increased train idling

   gross tonmiles the use of gross tonmiles or gtm provides the broadest look at fuel
   economy taking into account fuel consumed by nonrevenue work trains yard switching activity
   and empty freight cars traveling on revenue trains in 2015 ns trains moved 3844 billion gtm
   on average ns consumed 128 gallons of diesel fuel per 1000 gtm achieving the same fuel
   economy as in 2014 ns is basing its 2020 fuelefficiency goal on gross tonmiles the 2020
   target is 117 gallons per 1000 gtm

   since 2011 the company has improved fuel efficiency by 3 percent per 1000 gtm




                                                                                                             67

alternatives to reduce fuel use
norfolk southern is an industry leader in exploring alternative energy sources to reduce locomotive
emissions during 2015 ns made gains in battery technology and compressed natural gas

a strategic shift on battery technology
since the 2009 rollout of ns 999 a prototype battery switcher
locomotive norfolk southern has continued research into battery
technology as an alternative energy source for locomotives in
2015 the company made a strategic shift instead of focusing
on tractive power in a full hybrid ns now is exploring use of
batteries for just the opposite  to allow locomotives to be shut
down thus reducing fuel burn and emissions from idling engines

ns hopes to develop a microhybrid solution the idea is to
install a small battery pack on locomotives to operate critical
electronic control systems such as onboard trainhandling
equipment while the locomotive is shut down similar to
automobiles locomotive electronics and other operating systems are run by the same battery pack that
starts the engine which requires a surge in power as a result locomotives often remain idling or go
through an automated stopstart process when not moving freight to avoid draining the batteries while
keeping those electronics running

economic and environmental benefits equipping the locomotive fleet with a microhybrid battery pack
to reduce engine idling is much more costeffective than building a fleet of hybridpowered locomotives

were trying to use battery technology in a way that gives us the most fuel and emissions savings
for the investment said sean woody manager technology development and leader of the rd
effort locomotives produce more emissions and are the least fuel efficient when theyre idling so
reducing idling time provides the most opportunity for improvement we realize theres tremendous
payoff from doing that

lessons learned ns is applying lessons learned from six years of work developing the ns 999 the
companys microhybrid research includes looking at the best type of batteries to use how much
battery power is required and forecasting system costs currently battery technology remains too
expensive and is not advanced enough to provide reliable locomotive tractive power  factors that
played into ns strategic shift an upgraded secondgeneration version of ns 999 tested in yard
service during early 2015 was equipped with nearly 900 leadcarbon batteries and maintenance
was an ongoing issue

we still see the potential woody said but the technology and the economics are just not there yet

ns builds and tests a cng locomotive
norfolk southern continues to advance its knowledge of cng
technology as an alternative to diesel fuel to power locomotives

in 2015 employees at ns juniata locomotive shop successfully
modified a gp382 switcher locomotive engine to run entirely
on compressed natural gas the unit which has not been put
into service is paired with a locomotive slug housing cng
cylinders that supply the equivalent of 1000 gallons of diesel

its built and its functional said don faulkner general
superintendent locomotive shops who oversees ns
locomotive rebuild programs at juniata locomotive shop
where work on the cng prototype occurred

ns is interested in the potential of cng to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides particulate matter and
hydrocarbons compared with dieselpowered locomotives ns in 2015 put the prototype through
thirdparty emissions testing and is exploring ways to enhance its performance using cng locomotives

            emissions the natural way ns partnered with greentrees the nations leading reforestation program
            committing 56 million to plant more than 6 million trees




            income for landowners the trees and trains project is generating income for about 50 landowners who
            agreed to plant cottonwoods and native hardwoods on former woodlands that were converted years
            ago to farm fields but became marginally productive and prone to flooding over 15 years the trees
            planted through trees and trains will generate more than 11 million metric tons of carbon credits

ns in 2015 launched a project to restore 290 acres of historic wetlands at its brosnan forest conference
facility the project to be completed in 2016 will create valuable wildlife habitat and restore natural
water hydrology while supporting economic development in the region ns donated a conservation
easement that will permanently protect the restored wetlands acreage

this wetlands mitigation bank will generate 790 wetlands credits that ns through a broker can sell
to offset wetlands impacted by development elsewhere in the region the credits could be used for
example to support development of railserved industrial projects that would create new business for
ns with wetlands credits in coastal south carolina currently priced from 6000 to 8000 each ns
potentially could earn more than 6 million selling them

forest has railroad roots
located about 35 miles northwest of charleston sc brosnan forest has been in railroad ownership
since the 1830s once serving as a source for track crossties and fuel for steam locomotives in the
1920s southern railway an ns predecessor railroad used the property as a laboratory for university
forestry students and to demonstrate the economic advantages of planting property in woodland
these days ns operates a small conference center at the forest as a place to build business relation
ships with customers and to offer management employees an offsite location for strategic planning
and brainstorming sessions



employee spotlight
protect the planet earn a profit
josh raglin general manager facilities has helped make norfolk southern
a us corporate leader in conservation capitalism a business approach
that turns conservation into opportunities for profit

a biologist by training raglin manages ns brosnan forest business
center and 14405acre woodlands preserve in 2008 raglin helped
ns pioneer a conservation easement that permanently protects
12488 acres of the property from development including more than
6000 acres of rare longleaf pine forest since then raglin has
spearheaded several initiatives showcasing conservation capitalism
including creation of a wetlands mitigation bank his latest project through raglins efforts ns has

 qualified the forest for enrollment in both the sustainable forestry initiative and the forest stewardship
   council by adopting best management forestry practices while preserving plant and wildlife habitat
   these certified practices increase the value of timber that ns allows to be periodically harvested as
   part of the propertys management

 earned around 300000 carbon offset credits for the forest working with finite carbon to verify and
   register the credits with the air resources board in california through the arb ns sells the credits
   to companies desiring to offset their emissions over the past year a carbon credit in the california
   market has traded in the 9 to 10 range

 expanded the number of endangered redcockaded woodpeckers nesting at the forest creating the
   worlds largest known colony on privately owned land under single ownership through a safe harbor
   agreement with wildlife and natural resource agencies ns efforts to expand the birds population
   has earned 21 mitigation credits that ns can sell to developers wishing to build on property housing
   isolated pairs of the woodpeckers

          a look at 2015 ghg emissions




          overall ghg decline
          norfolk southerns total greenhouse gas emissions  scope 1 direct emissions and scope 2 indirect
          emissions  declined by nearly 2 percent in 2015

          the decrease reflects a 24 percent drop in business volume as measured by revenue tonmiles of freight
          moved by ns dieselburning locomotive fleet the main source of ns direct ghg emissions in addition
          ns reduced by 61 percent its scope 2 emissions related to electricity use at railroad offices and facilities
          this drop is attributed mainly to a milder winter systemwide energy efficiency improvements and
          the midyear closure of the companys roanoke corporate office part of an initiative to streamline
          business operations

          update on ghg goal
          in 2010 ns set a goal to reduce carbon emissions by 10 percent per revenue tonmile as measured
          against 2009 baseline emissions the railroad in 2015 achieved a cumulative emissions reduction of
          8 percent per rtm  down from 85 percent in 2014 contributing to the slip were network congestion
          in the first half of the year and a changing business mix that included more timesensitive freight resulting
          in higher horsepower moves that increased locomotive fuel burn and emissions

          locomotives in 2015 accounted for 90 percent of ns total ghg emissions or nearly 5 million metric
          tons ns goal is to reduce ghg emissions by 3 grams of co₂ per rtm over the 2009 baseline the
          company reduced cumulative emissions by 241 grams per rtm in 2015 compared with 256 grams
          in 2014 initiatives designed to meet a fuelefficiency goal set in 2015 will advance ns efforts to
          reduce its ghg emissions




                                                                                                                           72

progress on energy emissions
during the year ns achieved a 7 percent reduction in nonlocomotive scope 1 emissions related to
the use of fuels other than diesel such as natural gas propane and coal nearly half of that reduction
is associated with the companys reduced use of coal for power including the elimination of coalfired
boilers in an energyconversion project at juniata locomotive shop


customer recognizes ns sustainable rail solution
customer eastman chemical company presented norfolk southern with supplier sustainability and
innovation awards in 2015 for a railbased transportation solution that helped eastman reduce its
supplychain carbon emissions and shipping costs

ns intermodal business group worked with eastmans global logistics group in 2014 to offer rail
transport of eastman specialty plastics and woodbased products from an intermodal port facility in
greer sc to the port of charleston prior to the rail option eastman moved these containerized
products by truck from its kingsport tenn plant to charleston for export the ns solution removed
212 miles of truck transport

                                         the norfolk southern intermodal group made sure this was
                                         a value proposition that made sense for eastman said debbie
                                         davis waltermire eastmans director of global logistics procure
                                         ment eastman has goals around sustainable growth and improved
                                         carbon footprint and we felt that this gives us supplychain
                                         efficiencies that allow for sustainable growth

                                         ns partnered with the south carolina ports authority to provide
                                         rail service at the upland sc inland port facility which opened
                                         in fall 2013 ns rail service between greer and charleston is
                                         helping to reduce supplychain emissions of other customers

 juniata energy conversion a sustainable business solution
 norfolk southern in 2015 launched a twoyear energyconversion project at its juniata locomotive
 shop that demonstrates the companys commitment to improved operating efficiencies and stewardship
 of resources

 the 53 million project replaces the facilitys heating and power systems installing 21st century energy
 technologies to extend the life of a locomotive complex that has served americas freight rail needs
 since the late 1800s

 during 2015 ns replaced three 1950s coalfired burners with cleaner more efficient natural gas
 heaters the company began installing a 12 megawatt combined heat and power unit that runs on
 natural gas and generates enough electricity to carry the complexs base power load  reducing
 reliance on the regional utilitys power grid

 the project significantly reduces ns environmental impacts in 2015 largely as a result of the juniata
 conversion ns reduced by 39 percent its scope 1 emissions associated with the companys use of coal
 for energy ns generated 17464 metric tons of co₂ equivalent emissions from coal use down from
 28570 metric tons in 2014 in addition replacement of leaky pipes that transport steam water for
 shop operations is expected to save about 49 million gallons of water annually

     efforts to improve waste management
     norfolk southern in 2015 completed the second year of an ongoing review to track and improve data
     collection and management of its business waste streams  a challenging task encompassing
     hundreds of work locations across 22 states

     for the year ns reduced total waste generated by 6 percent  a desired outcome however data
     collection indicated that a higher percentage of waste than in 2014 was sent to landfills which ns is
     reviewing in particular ns is interested in increasing blue bin recycling rates at offices yard shop and
     field facilities in 2015 only 6 percent of such trash including cans bottles and paper was recycled

     ns has formed a task force that is exploring opportunities to expand recycling minimize waste and
     reduce costs associated with waste management the company in 2016 is evaluating thirdparty waste
     management services to apply lessons learned from data collected over the past two years

recycling and reusing waste oils
in 2015 norfolk southern recycled 100 percent of used oil collected at 26 locomotive and rail car
shops across the network the companys strategic sourcing group initiated this recycling program in
2013 as part of a life cycle sustainability initiative to control spending enhance operating efficiencies
and improve stewardship of resources

the programs goal is to reuse the oil to heat shop facilities to reduce utility costs or sell it to thirdparty
vendors for recycling and reuse a thirdparty vendor collected 114 million gallons of used oil from ns in
2015 the vendor resells the oil for use in heating manufacturing asphalt or producing lube oil products

oil recycled through this program represents
86 percent of used oil generated by ns business
operations the remaining 14 percent includes oil
recovered from track equipment in the field by ns

 proactive crosstie recycling
 the wooden crossties that hold steel rails in place are a vital
 part of railroad track infrastructure norfolk southern installed
 24 million in 2015 alone as part of sustainability efforts ns
 works with vendors to recycle older crossties removed from
 rail service

 in 2015 ns stepped up those efforts creating a service contract
 for a vendor to immediately collect crossties removed by timber
 and surfacing gangs the ts gangs install new crossties and
 stage the removed ties near the track for collection

 its an organized effort to pick up the ties in a timely fashion said carla groves senior manager
 purchasing having the vendor follow the gangs enables us to be more proactive which helps the
 environment and increases operating efficiencies

 reducing ns environmental footprint
 norfolk southern operates a robust environmental protection program to ensure that railroad operations
 meet or exceed government rules and regulations put in place to protect the environment including air
 and water quality

 following are three examples from 2015 that highlight ns efforts to minimize the environmental impact
 of business operations in communities served by the railroad

 capital upgrades invested 79 million in railroad yard shop and field facilities such as wastewater
 treatment plants spill containment systems and stormwater management systems to ensure
 environmental compliance

 site remediation completed remediation projects on 15 impaired properties in compliance with state
 environmental requirements among them is a 100acre former rail car shop facility in lenoir city tenn
 that ns is helping local and state economic development officials market for industrial redevelopment
 bringing new jobs and tax revenue to the community

 tank car safety participated in and led industry efforts to enhance the safety of transporting flammable
 liquids by rail including crude oil and ethanol these efforts resulted in development of a new proposed
 tank car construction standard designed to reduce the chances of an explosion if a car derailed leaked
 and caught fire the proposal garnered broad stakeholder support including from the rail industry tank
 car manufacturers chemical shippers and thermal blanket manufacturers
