sequence of the social audit

        day 1 of the actual audit is dedicated primarily to the tour of the
        factory emergency escape routes floor markings first aid kits
        junction boxes fire alarm and extinguishing systems toilets
        sewing machines the factory canteen storage spaces and
        waste disposal are checked if there is time left over the official
        interviews can also begin the team also talks with union repre
        sentatives and management in addition to workers

        day 2 is dedicated to an inspection of documents does the
        information about working hours agree with invoices from the
        canteen do the security guards who are hired by a service
        provider have social security insurance here once again it
        really pays off to have on board a local colleague who speaks
        the local language

        the conclusion is the creation of what is called a corrective
        action plan cap in short all of the identified improvement
        options findings are noted in this document provided with a
        date and responsibility and arrangements made for how the
        findings will be tackled

        now the ball is in our court the cap will be gone over with the
        partner during regular telephone calls and onsite visits and the
        findings resolved
        these audits will be repeated every three years in the case
        of critical issues that we cannot personally review audits can
        however also be repeated earlier by professionals




                                                                               13

leather sourcing

leather sourcing

       with the acquisition of offermann a leather supply chain
       became relevant for us one which includes special challenges
       we responded quickly and boldly here and now source the fin
       ished tanned hides starting with the spring  summer 2017 col
       lection from the longestablished company leder heinen in
       mönchengladbach instead of from a local but nontransparent
       market in india the hides come from northern german beef
       cattle and the tanning process takes place under the best eco
       logical considerations we are very proud that we were able to
       implement this step so quickly the products from the previous
       collection will continue to be made with the leather from india




       leather is also partly used for the brands a e p pinqponq satch
       and ergobag here we work together with saigon tantec stl
       vietnam the tannery was commissioned in 2010 according
       to the highest environmental standards and with the help of aid
       money from germany stl boasts wind turbines which cover
       100 of its electricity demand solar thermal energy bamboo
       walls for temperature regulation and a green treatment plant
       the proof of origin for the leather also persuaded us all the
       hides that stl uses come from north american beef cattle
       tantec however receives the hides already tanned upstream
       are 4 other tanneries two in the us and two in brazil we will
       also look closely at these tanneries and check whether they
       comply with the environmental standards that are so important
       to us

       also is being made in customized boxes

       we converted the plastic outer packaging in fiscal year
