joint message of the chairman
of the board of directors
and of the ceo
2015 represented the turning point for the bcp group after 4 years of losses the bank attained a net income of
235 million euros and recorded positive results in portugal and in its international operations
showing a general improvement in the financial indicators and a significant enhancement in operational eﬃciency
millennium bcp has been consistently adjusting itself to the transformation that is currently underway in the banking
industry and to a new reality  such as the one resulting from the banking union at a regulatory and supervisory level 
allowing it to anticipate the compliance with the goals agreed for 2017 with the directorate general for competition of
the european commission and to continue to regain the trust of its customers and remaining stakeholders
however and because we are a bank committed to sustainability and responsible business practices 2015 was also the
year when millennium bcp stood once again by the people the society and local communities
we kept our commitment towards culture supporting events addressed to very diﬀerent audiences set up exhibits on
various themes that allowed us to share the art works owned by the bank in a close and inclusive manner promoting and
recognising the creative merit and contributing to the recovery of historical assets
education science and investigation are also areas where millennium bcp continues to intervene supporting in an active and
consequent manner projects and initiatives that stood out due to their innovative features and ability to add value to society
in microcredit an area that completed 10 years in 2015 and that is also an example of social responsibility in millennium
bcp the bank continued to support the entrepreneurial spirit and selfemployment focusing on disclosing this valuable
instrument to fight poverty and unemployment to the entities closer to socially excluded populations since 2005
it adds up to 5253 jobs resulting from projects funded by millennium bcps microcredit 593 of which in 2015
concerning social support the bank stood once again and in all the countries where it operates by those in need and
underprivileged in 2015 in portugal the bank was visibly involved with the food bank particularly with the campaigns
for the collection of food which counted with the contribution of many hundreds of volunteers from millennium bcp
it also carried out internal actions in favour of charitable institutions such as associação acreditar or comunidade vida e
paz in mozambique we must point out within the scope of the social responsibility programme mais moçambique pra
mim more mozambique for me the aid given to the centre of infulene for orphan children and the campaign launched
in favour of the victims of the severe weather conditions that aﬀected the north of the country in angola we must
mention the ongoing support provided to lar de nazaré and in poland the involvement with the programme nikifory
a programme to help disabled artists
concerning business the bank endeavoured to support investors companies and families by the granting of sustainable
loans adjusted to their financial needs and capacities within the scope of accessibilities the electronic banking solutions
that millennium bcp is providing for the trading of products and services represent a strong contribution for the financial
inclusion of all citizens
within this context the improvement of the degree of financial literacy is for group bcp a primary goal in all its
operations an example of this commitment are the actions that have been carried out by the bank to increase the
level of financial literacy of the citizens namely of the youngest always taking into consideration the importance of
the adoption of adequate banking behaviours and the making of stable and informed decisions
we must also highlight the commitment to training and personal and professional development of bank employees
in 2015 it was held over 2300 training activities in various areas  departments of the bank
concerning environmental performance we again underline the sustainability strategy of incorporating and promoting
a culture of responsible consumption and investment assuming the commitment to continuously reducing the groups
ecological footprint due to this engagement the group was able to substantially reduce its consumption of water and
materials in 2015
lastly and for the 10th consecutive year group bcp is engaged in complying with the un global compacts ten principles
and is investing in actions related to human rights labour practices environmental protection and anticorruption
the bank plays through its responsible business practices a relevant and distinctive role in all countries where it
operates contributing for the well being of individuals for the economic and social development of society and for
the protection of the environment is still a bank committed to gender equality having come to adopt measures that
allow to approach the management of the bank with the policy of meritocracy irrespective of gender and having been
developing initiatives to support birth and parenting
we do believe that in 2016 we will continue to be able to keep our engagement with the future by creating an agile
modern close simple and sustainable bank we will continue to pursue the path that gives us the possibility of enhancing
a key asset the relation of trust we have with our stakeholders

comply with the legislation rules and requirements that guide the activities carried out by the bank and its subsidiary companies in order
to avoid the risk of the institution incurring in legal or regulatory sanctions financial losses or negative eﬀects in terms of reputation
resulting from noncompliance with the laws codes of conduct and good business practices and duties that bind the company

within the scope of the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing the activities of the compliance area include filtering
operations to comply with the sanctions and embargos regime imposed by the competent national and international authorities

maintenance of entities and accounts and of credit operations these functions based on tailored technological solutions also
include the definition and management of the risk models in view of the evolution shown by the several variables that lead to the
computation of scorings to apply to the operations

however avoiding noncompliance by the employees requires not only the implementation and adequacy of the processes in force
within the group to all the regulatory alterations but also training and a permanent flow of information on relevant issues

on the several issues related with the compliance activity this training mainly targets the employees awareness of the need to adopt
an ethical and rigorous professional conduct in their daily functions this figure has decreased versus 2014 year when transversal
training actions were carried out due to regulatory changes to provide the employees with the necessary competences to deal with
complex diligence processes namely those presenting nonnegligible risks in order to decrease operational and fraud risks continues
to be part of the groups activities plan

portugal  environmental signs campaign
in portugal the bank continued the internal communication campaign  reduction of consumptionenvironmental signs
campaign an initiative which intends to i reduce the banks operating costs ii improve its environmental performance
and e iii increase the identification of the employees with the organization

this initiative aimed at decreasing consumption especially targeting electricity water and paper was part of a broader
programme to cut down on consumption underway at the bank which translates into upgrading the technological
infrastructures rationalizing technical logistic and operating means monitoring proceedings and other improvements and
into the involvement of employees and resident outsourcers as they play a role in the eﬀective behavioural change to how
the resources available are used

thus an essential goal underlying this initiative was to encourage and motivate employees to through their individual
contribution translating into a strict management of the resources available to undertake the daily activities be part of the
collective eﬀort to transform millennium bcp into a more environmentally sustainable bank

    mozambique  support to the environmental awareness of local communities
    in mozambique millennium bim has been supporting and developing projects to increase the awareness of the local
    communities on environmental issues and initiatives to preserve environment and improve the quality of life of the
    individuals of which stands out the aid granted to amor  associação moçambicana de reciclagem an environmental
    association for the development of the selective collection of urban waste by means of the 10 existing ecopoints an
    average of 120 tons of waste is recycled every month from 2400 to 2600 m3 a figure representing a significant saving in
    natural resources and in co2 emission figures show that apart from the fact that this environmental project is contributing
    to improve the management of waste by the municipalities of maputo and matola one can also observe a change in the
    habits of many families in what concerns recycling and reuse of waste materials

    in 2015 amor developed the project uma cidade limpa pra mim  recicla e ganha to increase the young students
    awareness for the importance of their behaviour towards the adoption of good environmental practices and their role in
    contributing for a change of habits at home showing that together they can make a diﬀerence in reducing urban waste
    and contribute for the construction of a better mozambique

    in the six months of the project it carried out several activities for the preservation of environment and the promotion
    of sustainability principles reduce reuse and recycle in spaces developed by technicians of amor  environment clubs
     students and teachers carried out several activities demonstrating the importance of children as citizens in their relation
    with the environment

    each school has a recycling station where the correct separation of waste is made the schools were able to collect more
    than 8 tons of paper plastic and cans

    still within the scope of this project they oﬀered to feima  feira de artesanato flores e gastronomia de maputo garbage
    cans which were painted by artists belonging to the association who were able to create true works of art



  environmental footprint

  the bcp group regularly monitors a set of environmental performance indicators that measure the level of ecoeﬃciency of the bank
  vs the main resources consumption namely water energy greenhouse gas emissions solid waste and materials

  globally the banks level of ecoeﬃciency continued to improve as a result of the continuous investment in new equipments better
  procedures and in the changes introduced in the employees behaviour

  when the environmental performance indicators of group bcp per employee indicated in the following table are assessed we can
  observe a positive performance by the majority of the indicators the consumption of paper increased versus 2014 mainly in the
  operations of mozambique and switzerland and the global decrease in the number of employees of group bcp due to the banks
  internal restructuring process resulted in an increase in the paper consumption ratio per employee

                                                                                       2015 sustainability report  environmental responsibility

energy consumption
the banks consumption of energy is mostly of indirect origin which corresponds to the electricity and thermal energy acquired and met
60 of the banks energy needs in 2015 the consumption of indirect and direct energy went down 14 and 11 respectively vs 2014

concerning the domestic activity millennium bcp reduced its energy consumption by 9 and exceeded its annual target 5 the
consumption of electricity went down 9 vs 2014 this 51 gwh reduction avoided around 1175 tons of co2 and saved more than
700 thousand euros

the cogeneration central in tagus park produced 19 of the electricity consumed by the bank

in portugal there was also a significant reduction in the consumption of direct energy namely 11 of natural gas and around 6 of
diesel due to the reduction of the car fleet and in the number of employees

total consumption

internationally speaking the reductions verified in the consumption of indirect energy are mostly due to the 25 decrease in the
consumption of electricity in poland as a result of the energy eﬃciency measures implemented and of the closing of some agencies
as well as to the operation in angola which due to the central services having moved to other premises was unable to assess the
respective consumption

there was also a fall in the consumption of petrol in angola 18 in mozambique 10 and in poland 7 due to the reduction
of the car fleet

  methodology
  scope of the report

  the scope of the indicators reported is international and included in 2015 the following operations portugal poland mozambique
  angola and switzerland

  report limitations
  most quantitative indicators have records that go back three years the most significant limitations of the report are related to the
  comparison and analysis of the indicators evolution

  in 2010 angola and switzerland were included in the report in the economic and social indicators therefore it was not directly
  comparable to the 2009 sustainability report

  in 2013 all the data for 2012 were recalculated so as to include the data from angola in absolute numbers and this enable comparing
  with the banks data reported in 2013 in 2013 the report no longer included greece and in 2014 it no longer included romania
  as these operations were sold in the meantime thus a large part of the annual variations must be seen as possibly altered by the
  greek and romanian operations leaving the bcp group
