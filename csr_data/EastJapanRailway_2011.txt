our role as a railway operator
and starting anew
restoration andcreative reconstructionfrom the great east japan earthquake
first of all please allow us to offer our deepest sympathies for all of the victims of the great east japan earthquake
of march 11 2011 and to offer a solemn prayer for those who lost their lives

the great east japan earthquake brought unprecedented damage to countless places within our service area and
caused severe damage to our railway facilities due to this damage both shinkansen and conventional lines in the
devastated areas had no choice but to suspend operations for an extended period of time in addition parts of
the group  s shopping centers hotels and other facilities were also forced to suspend their operations due to the
damage to their buildings and others
following the earthquake as a result of the enormous support we received from everyone concerned and the
concerted restoration efforts of the jr east group as a whole we were able to resume train operations one after
another with the exception of the railway sections running along the pacific ocean which received particularly
catastrophic damage due to the tsunami these achievements could not have been accomplished without the
efforts of all of the people who so unselfishly devoted themselves in the early days and nights of restoration despite
the intermittent aftershocks i would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one you who lent your
support during the time we required to resume our services

by april 29th 2011 we were fortunate to have been able to resume operations for all railway sections of the
tohoku shinkansen lines on that day i boarded the first train to resume service between sendai and morioka and
participated in an event for the reconstruction of the area around hirosaki i was so pleased to see so many happy
faces in aomori hirosaki morioka and sendai with people walking together and smiling with their families and
friends we have also received many voices of support from our customers for our efforts to resume service of all
tohoku shinkansen lines in observing the anxiety and inconvenience the damage to our railway facilities created
for our customers first hand we were able to better understand the significant impact thatconnecting railshave
on our customersspirit and reaffirm our company    s ultimate mission to realize the uninterrupted service of our
railways something indispensable for the local people and for society in general

the jr east group is committed to its continued restoration efforts
for the damage resulting from the great east japan earthquake and
will approach this undertaking together as a group and as a principal
issue for the restoration of the railway sections alongside the
pacific ocean we plan to proceed cooperatively restoring the area
as a whole and in the planning of the area     s urban development
moreover in order to fulfill our social responsibilities as a corporate
group with business foundations in the eastern japan area we
intend to continue our hard work to restore the areas impacted by
the disaster through such efforts as the creation of tourism through
the excavation of local resources distribution of more information
and the hosting of farm fresh markets at our major terminal stations
for the sales of products from quakehit areas




                                                                                       jr east group sustainability report 2011   4

inaugural year for service quality reformsour customersvoices as our guide
 jr east group has been working to date on improvements to customer services and on the provision of safe and
 comfortable operations upholding therigorous pursuit of customer satisfactionas one of the basic management
 policies outlined in ourjr east 2020 vision  i do mu 
 additionally to further improve customer satisfaction jr east group has decided to allocate this year as the
inaugural year for service quality reformsin an effort to continue its work to better enhance the service quality of
 our group as a whole by making our services accessible to as many customers as possible despite being immersed
 in a severe business environment based on ourservice quality reform mediumterm vision5year plan beginning
 from this year we aim to improve the railway environment in which our customers can safely and comfortably
 use our services through improvements to our transport quality we seek to prevent transport interruptions
 resume operations with limited delay in the case of an interruption and enhance our systems for the distribution of
 information


 our ceaseless pursuit of extreme safety levels
 based on the accumulated experience from past disasters jr east group aims to further enhance its safety in
 operations under its 5year safety plan2013 safety visionmore specifically we plan to promote our disaster
 countermeasures including the seismic reinforcement of elevated bridges and other structures and an increase in
 the number of seismometers moreover through our investigations of the handling of operations after the great
 east japan earthquake we plan to devise an inventory of areas in need of improvement and cite the lessons
 learned from this disaster in our future countermeasures furthermore for major accidents such as the level crossing
 accident on the iiyama line we are committed to continuing our comprehensive investigations into the origins of
 such accidents and the prevention of their recurrence and continue our neverending challenge to achieve extreme
 safety levels in our railway operations


 our continued endeavors toward the global environment the utilization of new
 technologies
 following the accidents at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant the government of japan is currently
 reevaluating its policies on energy
 consequently the roles of railways with their low co2 emissions and high energy efficiency are continually growing
 we also anticipate that the importance of our accumulated efforts to reduce the environmental burden of the jr east
 group will similarly be further increased regrettably based on the current trends in national energy policy we have had
 no choice but to reexamine the total co2 emission targets upheld in ourjr east 2020 vision  i do mu nevertheless
 we will remain steadfast in our efforts to address global environmental issues and in our desire to promote
 technological developments from a wider viewpoint including those regarding the utilization of new energies such
 as wind and solar power and the introduction of railway systems employing rechargeable batteries

 we consider this disaster and the subsequent accidents at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant to hold
 high potential in the changing structure of japan s economy with this year marking the 25th year since the jnr
 privatization reform jr east group is once again aiming for acreative reconstructionpromoting management
 reforms with a firm resolution to start once again from scratch though it is expected that the severe management
 environment will be with us for quite some time

2 utilizing our experience from past earthquakes
in learning from the earthquakes to date jr east has initiated various earthquake countermeasures
including the seismic reinforcement of elevated bridges and improvements to its earthquake early detection
system and earthquake early warning system
in order to utilize the lessons learned from the 1995 great hanshinawaji earthquake jr east instituted
a series of seismic reinforcement measures for rigidframe elevated viaduct support columns and
bridge columns which were previously susceptible to shear failures by the end of march 2008 we had
reinforced all these facilities of shinkansen also on our conventional lines by the end of march 2009
we had completed the same reinforcement for all columns except the places that were related with other
construction work in the southern kanto and sendai areas
as a result we were able to prevent the collapse of elevated bridge columns at the time of the great east
japan earthquake currently we are working to reinforce elevated bridge columns which are susceptible to
failure due to bending from intense earthquake motion aiming to further improve our safety levels against
earthquakes
jr east has introduced a system for the shinkansen in which seismometers for the detection of primary
tremors pwaves are installed along its railway lines and on the coastlines this system allows us to stop
trains as soon as primary tremors are detected
at the time of the great east japan earthquake 2 shinkansen trains were operating in the sendai area at
the speed of approx 270 kmh the coastal seismometers were activated to shut down the power supply
1215 seconds before the earthquake motion exceeded thresholds for operational discontinuation and
actuate emergency braking for conventional lines our earthquake early warning system was introduced
for the tokyo metropolitan area in december 2007 and in all other areas in april 2009 the system utilizes
information obtained from shinkansen seismometers and earthquake early warnings transmitted by the
japan meteorological agency to stop trains in any section of track in the case of a major earthquake
additionally through the lessons we learned from the 2004 niigata chuetsu earthquake in which one of
our joetsu shinkansen trains was derailed in operation and from the perspective of preventing secondary
accidents following a derailment jr east has instituted numerous measures aimed at improving our
shinkansen railcars and tracks at the time of the great east japan earthquake one of our trains in test
operation derailed as such we are conducting further investigations into the mechanism of derailment in
order to improve such safety measures


3 issues remaining after the disaster and our countermeasures to them
immediately after the occurrence of the great east japan earthquake we establishedheadquarters for
earthquake disaster control headed by president and have strived to protect the customerssafety as the
matter of first priority
protecting the lives of passengers and employees at the time of a disaster and taking prompt action toward
restoration are considered of top priority in jr east   s business continuity plan bcp at the time of the
great east japan earthquake although our actions were consistent with this principle we have identified
some areas in need of improvement
in order to better direct passengers to evacuation in the occurrence of a tsunami or damage to our facilities
jr east established an investigative committee following the great east japan earthquake to study and
to verify our measures with both hardware and software and to consider any necessary improvements
under the committee each of the special interest groups of experts has been assigned to investigate the
following understanding the mechanisms of shinkansen derailment the verification of train stop systems
for shinkansen and conventional lines the verification of passenger evacuation guidance at the time of a
tsunami and measures to counter damage to shinkansen power poles
at the time of the great east japan earthquake even in the tokyo metropolitan area many seismometers
recorded nearly double the threshold designated for operational cessation and in most of our railway
divisions many of the inspections were required to be done on foot consequently after taking the range of
circumstances into consideration and the fact that some locations would require restoration work that was
judged to take until the following morning we decided to halt train operations on march 11 and close our
ticket gates
however as a result of these actions and the condition of station facilities at a number of our stations we
were forced to close the shutters of several passages which resulted in shutting customers out of those
stations we sincerely understand the grave inconvenience that these decisions caused to so many of
our customers as such we are currently reviewing the judgments and the handling of each one of our
actions on the day of the disaster and will continue our investigations into measures that support the
early resumption of operations the provision of temporary shelters inside stations where customers having
difficulty in returning to their homes can stay and stockpiles among others


                                                                                jr east group sustainability report 2011   8

although the epicenter of the great east japan earthquake was located within our service area the effects
of the earthquake spread well beyond those immediate surroundings extending to encompass a wide
range of regions including the tokyo metropolitan area for this reason the scope of the information
that we needed to collect was quite vast and ranged from issues of customer safety and the levels of
damage surrounding the epicenter to the transport of passengers in the tokyo metropolitan area although
it is our current policy to establish a countermeasure headquarters at both our head office and at the
branch office in the disasterimpacted area at the time of a disaster we plan to further review our options
to more promptly and functionally implement our countermeasures our procedures for establishing a
countermeasure headquarters and our methods of collecting information


4 towards restoration and reconstruction
on april 29 the 50th day after the march 11 disaster with the resumption of operations between sendai
and ichinoseki all sections of the tohoku shinkansen lines had resumed operations in contrast in the
pacific coastal areas which were severely damaged by the tsunami as both urban and residential areas
have been thoroughly devastated we also confirm serious damage to our railway facilities that requires a
largescale work for restoration currently several municipalities are in the process of formulating their own
reconstruction plans for some of these areas we are taking part in the relevant discussion jr east will
work together with national and local governments in its efforts to move forward with the restoration of our
railway divisions along the coastal areas damaged by the tsunami while remaining committed to participate
cooperatively in restoring the area as a whole and in the planning of urban development
moreover in order to contribute to increased tourism and the reconstruction of all of the regions in our
service area jr east is providing railway transport support through the aomori destination campaign the
sales of products like the jr east pass and the hosting of farm fresh markets at its major terminal stations
for the products of quakehit areas we are committed to our endeavors to support areas affected by
disaster and harmful rumor with the jr east group    s concerted efforts includingmarket for products from
disasteraffected areas in which agricultural products from the affected areas are on sale in stations in the
tokyo metropolitan area


 countermeasures for electricity supply issues
due to the severe shortage in electricity resulting from the earthquake while sincerely appreciating the
understanding of our customers we are continuing to work on energy saving at our stations and on board
this summer in compliance with the power use limitation order which was issued for the first time in 37
years the government of japan ordered limitations on the use of electricity at jr east we did our utmost
to comply with the government    s targets for reduction and conserve electricity through such measures as
reducing the number of weekday train operations during daytime hours and by switching off or reducing
the lighting at stations and on board
since severe electricity shortages are expected to remain for some time jr east has adopted the principle
to continue our energy saving effort through limiting the use of all unnecessary lighting at stations and on
board

 beginning in the ﬁscal year ending march 2011 the amount of energy used by group companies including that used by tenants and by the vehicle outside our business premise
  excluding the energy used by speciﬁed carriers is excluded from the total energy used by jr east in line with the act on rational use of energy energy conservation law along
  with the change in category of energy usage see page 14 the electricity supplied from jr east to its group companies which was previously calculated as jr east s energy use is
  now included in the energy used by group companies while the energy used by group companies for the work consigned by jr east is now included in jr east s energy use
  these changes have resulted in a reduction in the amount of energy used and the co2 emissions
 there are data that are missing due to the earthquake but their eﬀect on the total amount is negligible

2 measures to reduce noise along the tohoku and joetsu shinkansen lines we have completed measures to reduce noise to 75 db or less guided by the
   national government for other areas we have independently carried out improvement projects and completed them during ﬁscal 2010
3 measures to save energy at stations and oﬃces calculation is based on the energy categories used when the ﬁscal 2011 target was formulated

 energy saving at stations and offices
in respect of energy saving at stations offices etc jr east has set a new environmental target for fy 2011
in june 2008 and has been striving for renewing conventional equipment to new energysaving ones and
encouraging employees to save energy however because of the construction of increased number of
units on increased floor area of facilities including barrier free facilities and an increase in instation stores
we could not achieve the target
we are currently considering the setting of the targets separately for offices and transport departments in
line with the act on rational use of energy energy conservation law

 recycled office paper utilization rate
jr east launched its effort to achieve its own target to raise the utilization rate of recycled office paper in
1996 since the revision of the target in january 2005 it has been the target for the whole group we have
been striving for the target to accomplish 100 utilization of recycled paper as environment friendly paper
however perception has changed and it is now commonly recognized that using fsc certified paper is
also environmentally friendly and we have increased the use of fsc certified paper partly because of this
reason the group could not achieve the target of 100 utilization of recycled paper
in view of the fact that we are required to purchase environmentconscious goods and supplies we try
to set new targets which may encourage the use of not only recycled office paper but also environment
friendly goods to the greatest extent possible
 fsc certified paper the paper made of virgin pulp which is made only from the wood produced in compliance with local laws and
  regulations of the area of production fsc certified paper etc



 setting of the next term target
we are now undertaking the formulation of the target from fiscal 2012 based on the close inspection
of the past commitment and the current social conditions and will announce the target as soon as it is
finalized through press release and other media

 change in category of energy usage
 up to now jr east has broken down energy consumption by 4 categories ieconventional line
 operation shinkansen line operation  stations offices etcandsupply to other companiesfrom
 this fiscal year however in line with the energy conservation law we have decided to calculate and
 control energy consumption of jr east by dividingstations offices etcinto transportation category
stations rolling stock centers etcand nontransportation categoryhead office branch office etc
 as a result each department will control its own energy consumption which will help further reduction of
 energy usage for the boundary of the amount of energy used by jr east please refer to theboundary

 trends in co2 emissions
 our co2 emissions in the fiscal year ending march 2011 totaled 215 million tons a decrease of 039
 million tons over the previous fiscal year this was due to the restart of our own hydroelectric power plant
 which resulted in the reduction of the operating rate of our own thermal power plant and eventually in
 the reduction of co2 emissions from it

and in offices we will strive to save energy for train operation which accounts for about 70 of our total
energy consumption and reduce co2 emissions in various ways

reducing energy consumed for train operations
as of the end of march 2011 jr east had 10993 energyefficient railcars in operation this accounts for
88 of our railcar fleet we are putting into service more newgeneration energy efficient railcars with
features such as regenerative brakes which can convert kinetic energy during deceleration into electric
energy and variable voltage variable frequency vvvf inverters which control motors without wasting
electricity

dieselpowered electric motordriven hybrid railcars compared with the current trains fuel consumption
rate has been reduced by about 10 and the noise level of the trains idling at stations and accelerating
on departure has been lowered by 2030 db also in october to december 2010 we began operating

   s own power plants
jr
jr east operates a thermal power plant in kawasaki city kanagawa prefecture with a total output of
655 thousand kw at the plant we replaced three of its four generating units with combinedcycle power
generation units with improved generating efficiency in june 2006 we replaced kerosene with natural
gas as fuel for the no 3 generation unit in an effort to further reduce co2 emissions we will replace the
last steam powered generation unit using heavy oil with a combinedcycle generation system using natural
gas in fy 2014 output and co2 emissions from our thermal power plants in fiscal 2011 were lower
than those in previous year due to the restart of our own hydroelectric power plant which reduced the
operating rate of our own thermal power plant
 a combinedcycle power generation unit is a power generation unit that combines gas turbines propelled by combustion of gas with steam turbines
  driven by steam from the exhaust heat

saving energy used by information systems
in response to revisions to laws and regulations saving energy in office buildings has become increasingly
important since the fiscal year 2009 jr east has been working on this problem by endeavoring to turn off
power for certain information system equipment during nonuse hours resulting in savings of about 54000
kwh of power consumption in fiscal year 2010 we also reduced the number of servers by combining
equipment and worked to introduce energysaving products in the future we plan to expand the coverage
of equipment subject to these efforts with a view to further reduction of power consumption after the
great east japan earthquake we have strengthened our measures to set our businessuse pc terminals at
power saving mode as part of our electricity saving efforts

  led lighting installed on yamanote line
  beginning in december 2010 led lighting was installed on cars on yamanote line on an experimental
  basis the parts installed on the ceiling of a railcar must be nonflammable as a preventive measure
  against fire break outs so together with jr group companies we developed led lighting equipment
  that meet the standards and installed the same this lighting apparatus was installed on yamanote

  measures to create a sound material cycle

reducing waste and recycling
jr east generates many kinds of waste through its railway operations including daily trash removed from
trains and stations and industrial waste from our general rolling stock centers in addition restaurants
and retail stores in our lifestyle businesses produce garbage and general waste in order to reduce all
these various forms of waste jr east actively supports the approach known asreduce reuse recycle
for recycling in particular goals are set for each type of waste

recycling waste collected from stations and trains
in the fiscal year ending in march 2011 the ratio of trash from stations and trains that were recycled
was 92 beginning in the fiscal year ending march 2008 thermal recycling was considered and also
definitions were partly changed in the fiscal year ending march 2010 since the trash from stations
and trains contain some recyclable garbage we first placed segregation trash cans at stations to catch
recyclable waste then we established recycling centers in ueno omiya and shinkiba to make more
rigorous segregation in october 2010 to further improve recycling ratio we consolidated the recycling
centers in ueno and shinkiba and built the jr east tokyo materials recycling center operated by
east japan eco access co ltd within the compounds of tokyo freight terminal station and started
operation this center has a capacity to treat 17700 tons per year to make the center environment
friendly we provided greenery around the building

recycling initiatives at general rolling stock centers etc
jr east group is recycling waste generated during the manufacture and maintenance of rolling stock at
the niitsu rolling stock manufacturing factory we promote waste reduction and recycling taking into
account the railcarsentire life cycle starting at the time of designing at our regional general rolling stock
centers waste is sorted into 20 to 30 categories to reduce waste generation and promote recycling
starting in the fiscal year ending march 2006 we have included our retired railcars that were sold to
outside parties and later scrapped as part of the quantities recycled by the jr east group when calculating
our recycle rates

  biological diversity

hometown forestation program
in 2004 in order to protect biological diversity and contribute to a sustainable society while cherishing
our sense of gratitude to nature we began the hometown forestation programs to plant trees native
to each region and revitalize the forests we undertook these programs with the cooperation of
fukushima prefecture from 2004 to 2009 and with the cooperation of niigata prefecture and the town of
tsunanmachi in 2010 in addition in other areas served by jr east we are conducting tree planting native
to the areas and we shall continue to do the same in the future

forest development along railway lines
beginning in 1992 we have been engaged in tree planting activities along the jr wayside by fiscal 2011
a total of 44 thousand people participated in planting about 300 thousand trees today we have gone
beyond the wayside and do tree planting in cooperation with the communities

development of railway trees
along the jr east railway lines we have railway trees planted to shield the tracks from blowing snow and
wind the first railway forest was created in 1893 for disaster prevention as living disaster prevention
facilities railway forests are playing their roles
jr east now owns approximately 58 million railway trees on a total of about 4000 hectares along our
lines at approximately 1200 locations the trees absorb 16 thousand tons of co2 equivalent to 06 of
the co2 that jr east emits in this way they also contribute to preserving the environment
in 2008 after fundamentally reviewing the role of railway trees from the viewpoints both of disaster
prevention and environmental preservation we launched a new project to plant trees to replace those
that will require replacement over the coming 20 years

railway treesfrom single to multivariety trees
conventional railway trees were of a single variety primarily cedar trees because another function in
addition to protecting against natural disasters was to generate profits through the production of timber
this has recently been less successful however in the face of declining demand for domestic timber in
future tree replacement we will plant several varieties suitable for the local climate and develop them to
be more sustainable and ecologically resilient

planting new railway trees
ceremonies for the planting of new railway trees were held in the kakizaki no 1 railway forest between
kakizaki and yoneyama on the shinetsu main line on september 27 2008 in the oitama no 2 forest
on the ou main line between oitama and takahata on july 26 2009 and in the jinguji no 2 railway
forest on the ou main line between jinguji and kariwano on may 22nd 2010 with kind advice and
guidance from ecologist and professor emeritus akira miyawaki of yokohama national university several
varieties of native trees potential natural vegetation were selected and planted many local residents
and participants from organized tours participated in the ceremonies and discovered how the trees they
planted would grow to become useful as living railway disaster prevention facilities

   basic thoughts on noise reduction

improvement of the environment along railways basic thoughts on noise reduction
in the operation of trains noise is created by the train cars moving through the air by the wheels travelling
on the rails by the motors and by other sources in order to reduce noise we are working in various ways
to improve both the trains and our ground equipment
jr east also endeavors to reduce noise during maintenance work on track and structures to further
improve the environment along the lines

measures for the shinkansen lines
in accordance with the japanese government         s environmental quality standards for shinkansen
superexpress railway noise jr east has taken many steps to reduce this noise such as the installation
of soundproof walls and soundabsorbent materials rail grinding1 and the modification of our railcars to
operate more quietly we have already completed the implementation of measures to reduce noise levels
to 75 db or lower in densely populated residential areas along our railway lines and we plan to take
further steps by expanding the scope of areas where noise levels need to be reduced to 75 db or lower
also with the introduction of e5 series railcars which were developed based on the results of running
tests using the shinkansenfastechtest train jr east is working to improve the environment even as
we increase train speed including further reduction of noise and micropressure waves in tunnels2
 1 rail grinding a measure to smooth out uneven places in rails caused by wheels traveling over them this reduces noise by controlling car
    vibration
 2 micropressure waves in tunnels an explosive sound caused by compressed air being forced out of a tunnel when a shinkansen train
    enters it at a high speed the sound is produced at the end of the tunnel




                                          the e5 series employs lownoise pantographs



measures for conventional lines
we have implemented voluntary measures for conventional lines to minimize noise installing long rails1
and performing railgrinding and wheeltruing2 we also comply with the japanese government  s policy
on noise measures for construction of new conventional railways or largescale remodeling when we
engage in this kind of construction or modification of our conventional lines
 1 installing long rails rail joints are welded such that the length of a single rail becomes more than 200 meters with fewer rail joints these
    rails reduce noise produced at joints when trains pass
 2 wheel truing a measure to grind the unevenness of wheels caused by wear to restore their circular shape


measures for maintenance work
as the maintenance work is usually done during night we give advance notice about the schedule and
details of the work to residents in surrounding areas we also make utmost efforts to minimize noise by
using modified equipment producing lower noise furthermore by using track that is designed to resist
deformation jr east is reducing the volume of required maintenance work




                                                                                                           jr east group sustainability report 2011   27

  improvement of the environment along railway lines

restricting use of herbicides
safe train operations require regular removal of weeds along railway lines while we generally remove
them manually we also use a certain amount of herbicide we keep the usage of herbicides to a minimum
in both volume and range of use when selecting herbicides for use we select those from the safest of
the three levels of toxicity to humans and animals and from category a the safest of the five levels of
toxicity to fish we continue to observe the rules in place in order to keep our impact on the surrounding
environment to a minimum as with our initiative to postpone the spraying of herbicides when conditions
on the scheduled day are not satisfactory for spraying in fy 2011 221 tons of herbicides were used

harmony with the landscape
constructing a largescale railway facility or remodeling one can affect the immediate area and surrounding
environment and their design is increasingly important from the stage of planning and designing we
consider harmony with the landscape along with function and economy endeavoring to build facilities
friendly to the regional environment in the fiscal year ended march 2009 the tenmagawa bridge between
kamikitamachi and ottomo on the tohoku main line received the civil engineering design prize of the
japan society of civil engineersa recognition of our efforts by a distinguished outside party

   chemical substance management

compliance with laws and setting goals for reduction of chemical substances
when using chemical substances the effects on human health and ecological systems must be fully
considered the jr east group not only rigidly adheres to established standard values but sets its
own ambitious targets as well as much as possible we restrict the use of such substances and adopt
environmentally responsible substitutes

reducing and replacing ozone depleting substances
we endeavor to reduce the use of substances specified as controlled substances under the ozone layer
protection law and adopt environmentally friendly substitutes
 large heat exchangers large refrigeratorshaving steadily replaced air conditioning units using specified
  chlorofluorocarbons cfcs with systems that do not use them we completed the removal of such units
  from buildings by the end of march 2008
 rolling stockexcept for some diesel railcars all of our cars use cfc substitutes as of march 2011
  we were using 05 tons of cfcs and only 87 tons of cfc substitutes we routinely check for gas leaks
  and collect the refrigerants when scrapping retired railcars in accordance with applicable laws and
  regulations
 fireextinguishing agentalthough 63 tons of halon gas was still in use as a fireextinguishing agent as of
  march 2011 we have it under proper control and are replacing it with nonhalon agents such as powder
  agents and co2 when building new facilities or renovating existing ones

chemical substance management
as jr east uses chemical substances primarily for painting and repairing our railcars we take rigorous
steps for their use and management in order to prevent their leakage we are a company that handles
a considerable amount of specified chemical substances and 16 jr east facilities submitted the data
regarding the release and transfer of these substances to relevant authorities in the fiscal year ended
march 2011 pursuant to the prtr system
we are also promoting the introduction of stainless steel railcars that do not require painting at the end
of march 2011 as many as 81 of the 10703 cars operated on our conventional lines were stainless steel
railcars beside their use for railcars we used 321 tons of organic solvents for painting railway facilities and
stabilizing track beds in the fiscal year ended march 2011
 prtr system a system where companies notify their releases and transfers of chemical substances obliged by the act on confirmation etc
  of release amounts of specific chemical substances in the environment and promotion of improvements to the management thereof it

2 actions for energy conservation and global warming prevention
    for fy 2011 as principal activities of energy conservation and global warming prevention we worked
    to reduce power consumption through such activities as ① implementation of energy conservation
    campaign ② insuring no overtime days ③ co2 reduction by change of fuels in oncethrough boilers
    and ④ installation of sensors to respond to people   s presence in the workersroom to reduce power
    usage
    with respect to fuel change in oncethrough boilers we replaced heavy fuel oil that had been used with
    city gas resulting in a more than 10 reduction in co2 emissions per year with respect to sensors in
    workersroom we have finely rearranged electrical wiring in the hallways and rooms so that lights turn
    on automatically only where the sensors detect the presence of people also the conventional mercury
    lamps were replaced by energysaving type fluorescent lamps these actions resulted in considerable
    reduction in electricity usage
    in addition to the existing initiatives above niitsu rolling stock plant this fiscal year put an effort to
    reduce peak power consumption through ① reduction of lamps that are turned on in the buildings ②
    use of hand lamps led and ③ adjustment of operating time of automatic machinery all employees

  environmental accounting and management indicators

using environmental management indicators in business activities
in the fiscal year ended march 2011 our environmental conservation costs amounted to approximately
475 billion yen in investments and 224 billion yen in expenses of these investments costs for global
environmental conservation which accounted for a large portion were at the same level as the previous
year because we continued acquiring new railcars
by introducing these new cars we estimate we will reduce co2 emissions by 023 million tons during their
service lives
jr east has its own environmental management indicator to assess the relation between our business
activities and environmental impacts these are calculated by dividing co2 emissions which are a major
factor in our environmental impacts by operating profits which represent our economic value added
the smaller the value of the indicator is the smaller impacts we exert on the environment to create a
same economic value added for the fiscal year ended march 2011 the value of the indicator was 765
tco2billion yen compared with 945 tco2billion yen for the fiscal year ending march 1991

railway technical development on environment

following research and development are being pursued to construct a railway system with high
priority on environment

 organizing energy management
with a view to reducing energy needed to operate trains we are engaged in development of
storage batterydriven electric car system and in studying actual consumption of operating energy
we are also engaged in efforts to reduce energy at stations offices and general rolling stock
center

 application of energy saving technology to railway operation
we are engaged in research to apply to railways such highly energyefficient technologies as
photovoltaic power generation other renewable energy and heat pumps we are also engaged in
research of multipleuse technology

as specific examples we are working on the following research and development themes


development of a storage battery train system
 ne train new energy train smart denchikun
we are studying application of new motive energy to railways through a trial ne train new
energy train at present to reduce burden on environment in nonelectrified sections we are
making efforts at development of astorage batterydriven electric car systemwhich is a hybrid of
overhead lines and storage batteries

                       constitution of storage batterydriven electric car system



in this system trains receive electric power from overhead lines in electrified sections and run while
storing it in the storage batteries and in nonelectrified sections the trains run with power stored
in the batteries this system results in reduction of co2 as well as of noise compared with the
conventional diesel cars at present we are conducting running tests and rapid charging tests with
a trial car ne train smart denchikun in which this system is installed

study on effective use of regenerated energy
energy efficiency can be enhanced by making effective use of regenerated energy which is
produced when a train applies brakes
in order to accurately measure the regenerated energy we have placed electric energy meters
on the train as well as on the substation to conduct simultaneous measurement in this way we
plan to grasp the flow of energy analyze it to clearly identify the issues involved and work toward
improvement

making energy flow visible at tokyo station
we are proceeding with the development of a system to make energy flow visible using tokyo
station as a model
the conventional equipment system has been mostly focused on monitoring for the sake of
security by taking in information on energy conservation and making it visible we are building a
more efficient energy management system

  creation of a culture of safety

our 5 cultures of safety
to heighten levels of railway safety it is necessary to establish and support unwavering cultures of safety
the cultures of safety we seek is based upon accident information from the past and we learn and act
upon it in mutual trust



   ① a culture of proper reporting
      preventing the occurrence and recurrence of accidents through prompt and proper reporting of all
      accidents and incidents
   ② a culture of noticing
      the prevention of accidents through an awareness of the causes of accidents and the sharing of
      information that would prevent these causes from leading to actual accidents
   ③ a culture of direct meeting and discussion
      allowing for the open and honest exchange of opinions and discussions enables us to identify the
      causes of accidents and to take appropriate countermeasures against recurrence
   ④ a culture of learning
      continuously learning about accidents and learning from accidents and incidents which occur in
                                         s own workplace
      all places of work not just in one
   ⑤ a culture of action
      safety can only be secured by taking safe actions think and act for yourself this is at the core of
      our safety




sangen principle three actualities principleas a standard for action
accidents and incidents always occur at the genba this means that the sources of accident prevention
can also be found at the genba in order to suitably understand and rectify each accident or incident
jr east approaches safety issues with thethree actualities principleas its standard for action actual
locations actual objects and actual people

  operation etc as distinguished from management or office work in industrial sectors such as construction and manufacturing


developing safetyrelated human resources
with rapid shifts between generations the nurturing of employees who can assume major roles in ensuring
safety is becoming a pressing need jr east has assignedkey safety leadersfor its field organizations
and other such institutions andsafety professionalsfor branch offices and other such establishments to
increase levels of safety

the challenge safety campaign
in 1988 we started the challenge safety campaign with the aim of encouraging our employees to actively
take on the challenge of further improving safety levels rather than just passively maintaining safety the
challenge safety campaign aims to increase our employee awareness and sense of safety we intend to
guide all employees to more safetyoriented behavior by having them think about and discuss safety act
upon it and feel a sense of achievement through doing so

   improvement of safety equipment

investment in safety equipment forultimate safety levels
to achieve a more assured level of safety in railway operations weak points in the current systems
must be identified and reviewed from a safety standpoint furthermore safety equipment must undergo
intensive and effective assessments in order to prevent the occurrence of accidents in the future to date
our countermeasures have been primarily focused on preventing any reoccurrence of accidents that have
happened in the past however additional risks also exist such as the very realistic threat of a major
earthquake in the tokyo metropolitan area which would result in major damage to our railways as such
in addition to measures we have taken so far jr east will implement concrete countermeasures through
the analysis and evaluation of all potential risks before they actually evolve into accidents
regarding our improvements to safety equipment and based on our four previous 5year safety plans
leading up to fy 2009 jr east has invested more than 22 trillion yen for the 20 years since the company s
establishment in our 2013 safety vision jr east  s 5th 5year safety plan which began in fy 2010 jr east
plans to invest approximately 750 billion yen on safety measures for the 5year period between april 2011
and march 2014 with a cumulative safety investment amounted to approximately 25 trillion yen by the
end of fy 2011

installing safety equipment
to prevent collisions between trains jr east has installed ats automatic train stop and atc automatic
train control systems on all of its railway lines to heighten the current safety level of train operations
even further we are installing atsp and atsps systems which employ continuous speed monitoring
functions the number of installations is steadily increasing mostly in the tokyo metropolitan area by the
end of march 2011 the atsp system had been installed on 23361 km of railway line the atsps system
is currently installed on 2277 km of line in the sendai and niigata regions and at 34 stations
in addition in response to revisions to the ministry ordinance for technological standards for railways in
july 2006 we are working on measures to prevent excessive train speeds at turnouts at terminals and on
descending grades planned improvements at all curves that had been targeted for action were completed
by the end of march 2010

systemization of maintenance work
safety during maintenance work has been improved with the use of tctype wireless alarm systems
the systems warn employees working on railway tracks when a train is approaching jr east has also
introduced a safety system that enables workers performing maintenance to turn signals red from a
handheld device ensuring that trains are stopped whenever necessary the system is already in use on all
major lines in the tokyo metropolitan area and is being introduced to other railway divisions

                                      for maintenance work


practical application of the advanced train administration and communications system
 atacs train control system with radio transmission
atacs is a train control system utilizing radio transmissions by using radio communications for the
transmission of information between ground and onboard facilities the system enables the trains to be
mainly controlled by onboard equipment permitting reductions in traditionally required facilities such as
signals connecting cables and track circuits which are currently used for the detection of trains
eliminating these facilities is expected to reduce the number of facility failures and the number of
subsequent transport disruptions jr east plans to introduce this atacs to the senseki line for practical
operation the end of march 2012

introduction of effective rainfall as a new indicator
when there is heavy rainfall we ensure train safety through operational restrictions such as limits to train
speed and when necessary by suspension of operations for operational restrictions on conventional
lines we have been using hourly rainfall1 and continuous precipitation2 as our indices since june
2008 we have been usingeffective rainfallas a new indicator that is effective in prevention of landslide
disasters due to rainfall effective rainfall is the amount of underground water remaining after changes over
time in ground penetration and outflow using this indicator we can more precisely predict the occurrence
of landslide disasters improving the safety and reliability of our train operations

completion of reinforcement work for disaster prevention against heavy rainfall in the
 tokyo metropolitan area
jr east has completed its planned reinforcement work to railway lines to protect against heavy rainfall
the measures are intended to reduce operational restrictions due to heavy rain and minimize any effect
on train operations jr east began reinforcement work for disaster prevention against rainfall in april 2004
on 12 routes mainly in the tokyo metropolitan area and with high levels of traffic and this work was
completed in june 2008




                                     concrete lattice frame protection work


lessons learned from the past earthquakes
learning from earthquakes in the past jr east has employed the following three antiearthquake
measures
① the immediate stoppage of trains in operations emergency train stop measures
② the prevention of structural damage seismic reinforcement measures
③ the minimization of secondary accidents following derailment preventative measures against trains
  deviating from tracks

①early earthquake alert system
jr east has installed seismographs along coastal and shinkansen railway lines for the detection of primary
tremors pwaves our present system allows us to stop trains as soon as primary tremors are detected
for conventional lines our early earthquake alert system was introduced for the tokyo metropolitan
area in december 2007 and in all other areas in april 2009 the system enables trains in any section of
track to be stopped in the case of a major earthquake utilizing information obtained from our shinkansen
seismographs and from any advance announcements given by the japan meteorological agency

②seismic reinforcement of elevated bridges
in response to the 1995 great hanshinawaji earthquake jr east has been taking a number of seismic
reinforcement measures on rigidframe elevated bridge columns which were susceptible to shear failures
by the end of march 2008 we had reinforced all of our elevated shinkansen viaduct support columns
and shinkansen bridge columns on our conventional lines by the end of march 2009 we had reinforced
all other columns except in places that required additional construction work in the southern kanto and
sendai areas currently we are reinforcing elevated bridge columns susceptible to failure due to bending
by strong earthquake motion aiming to further improve our safety levels against earthquakes

③prevention of secondary accidents after derailment
during the niigata chuetsu earthquake in 2004 one of our joetsu shinkansen trains was derailed while
running fortunately this derailment did not lead to any injury to either our passengers or our train crews
learning from the events surrounding this earthquake jr east has taken numerous measures aimed to
improve our shinkansen trains and tracks for our railcars we have installed an lshaped car guide on
the bogies to restrict lateral movement of the car body for ground facilities we are improving the shape
of joint bars to lessen the impact of wheels on rail joints in the case of a derailment and implementing
countermeasures to prevent the overturning of railcars and the lateral movement of rails in the case that
metallic rail fasteners are damaged in derailment furthermore early detection of earthquake occurrence
by seismographs and of interruptions of electric transmission have enabled us to more promptly detect
earthquakes and start emergency braking about one second earlier
nevertheless at the time of the great east japan earthquake in march 2011 one of our trains in test
operation derailed after its regular inspection as such further investigations are needed in order to
improve our safety measures

measures to prevent railway crossing accidents
when the company was established in 1987 there were 247 accidents during the year at level crossings
in the fiscal year ending march 2011 the number had been drastically reduced to 36 approximately
60 of all levelcrossing accidents involve automobiles we have installed devices such as obstacle
detectors which are capable of detecting an obstacle such as an automobile stalled on a crossing and
stopping trains and we have put crossing warning devices in a higher position for better visibility more
large red and white crossing gates have been installed the barrier arms are thicker than usual and have
red and white reflective plates that cover the whole bar these are expected to provide better visibility
day and night studies are currently being carried out on the effectiveness of these bars in addition we
are presently promoting a wide range of public relations activities for the prevention of level crossing
accidents appealing to drivers for their cooperation and understanding
furthermore we are trying to increase the number of overhead crossings to eliminate level crossings with
roads and are doing this with the cooperation of local governments neighboring residents and the police
in addition for countermeasures against secondary accidents caused by derailments at level crossings we
are installing derailment prevention guards at level crossings

station platform safety
in the fiscal year ending march 2011 there were 76 accidents in which customers fell from platforms onto
tracks or came into contact with trains jr east is installing protectionrelated devices including emergency
trainstopping systems on our platforms to ensure the safety of its customers in addition since customer
awareness and cooperation are also vital to safety on our platforms we are implementing ourzero
platform accident campaignthrough posters as a measure to heighten the safety awareness of our
customers
furthermore as an additional accident prevention measure for customers on platforms jr east is
introducing automatic platform gates on the yamanote line in fy 2011 jr east introduced automatic
platform gates at ebisu and meguro stations from this fiscal year fy 2012 we will install gates at all
remaining stations applying the knowledge we accumulated through the analyses of technical issues
and the impact on train operations observed at the first two stations in fy 2013 we plan to introduce
these automatic platform gates to osaki and ikebukuro stations and in fy 2014 to otsuka sugamo
komagome shinokubo mejiro takadanobaba and tamachi stations with the exception of the 4
stations of shimbashi shibuya shinjuku and tokyo which require largescale improvement work we plan
to complete installations in all stations on the line by march 2019

  measures taken since the accident on the uetsu line

on december 25 2005 the limited express train inaho no14 derailed between sagoshi and kita
amarume stations near the no 2 mogamigawa bridge we would like to report on the measures we have
taken since this accident

increased number of anemometers wind meters
to date jr east has increased the number of anemometers at the accident site between sagoshi and
kitaamarume stations in addition for sections with operational restrictions due to strong winds we
established multiple anemometers as our new standard and increased the number of anemometers in
locations where windbreak fences were installed
additionally by reconfirming the requirements for wind restrictions on sections of railway lines using
information from frontline employees topography and wind conditions of the areas and adding new
operation restriction sections we are working to improve our safety observation network to counter the
effects of these strong winds furthermore by the end of march 2010 we had completed our planned
increase and installation of anemometers on the lines

expanded introduction of a gale warning system
we have been adding to our gale warning system to raise the level of safety by restricting operations
not only when the actual wind speed measured by anemometers exceeds restriction thresholds but also
when the projected maximum wind speed exceeds these limits
installation of our gale warning systems to all locations with operation restrictions against gales for
conventional lines was completed by september 2010

                                                    as of dec 25th                                   as of mar 31st                                                           increase

utilizing meteorological information to test methods for operational restrictions
local gusts are meteorological phenomena and are difficult to observe with conventional observation
equipment such as anemometers through meteorological information obtained from the japan
meteorological agency radar and by detecting the passing of cold weather fronts and the accompanying
development of cumulonimbus clouds we have been investigating how to forecast the occurrence of local
gusts and to apply that information to our operational restrictions from fiscal 2008 the system was tested
during the winter on the uetsu main line between niitsu and sakata and on the hakushin line between
niigata and shibata on february 17th 2009 we added the system to sections of the uetsu main line
shinetsu main line echigo line yahiko line and rikuu west line for additional testing
during this four year period of testing though we initiated train operational restrictions a total of six times
we did not observe any actual occurrence of local gusts

research of a doppler radar observation method
we are currently investigating the possible utilization of a doppler radar observation method to help
identify local gusts as information to be used for operational restrictions doppler radars can determine
wind conditions by detecting the movements of raindrops and rain clouds and are used at some airports
for detecting local gusts
since 2007 we have conducted local gust observations using a doppler radar with the system
constructed in 2010 as a basis for a local gust detection system we started realtime local gust detection
experiments at amarume station on the uetsu main line while conducting ongoing validations and
improvements through experimental monitoring of the local gust detection system we will advance our
research on the application potentiality of the system for train operation restrictions

customer satisfaction surveys
we conduct customer satisfaction surveys via our jr east customer questionnaires to enable us to gain
an understanding of how customers evaluate our services that we cannot get simply through customer
feedback and to quantitatively check levels of customer satisfaction the survey results are used to decide
which issues jr east should most urgently address as well as to confirm the efficacy of previous measures

prompt service quality improvements with customer comments at the core
customer comments may be discussed at various levels initially a decision about whether an improvement
is necessary or not is made at the level that received the original customer comment if no decision can
be made at that level then the customer comment is passed on to higher discussion levels all of which
are striving to introduce as many customersuggested improvements as possible in a concrete form at the
very top level we have also established the customer comments committee chaired by the president
which considers the possible implementation of improvement measures based on collected customer
comments through this system we are constantly striving for the attainment of improved customer
services

information enhancement
in order to enable us to provide prompt and accurate passenger information during transport disruptions
we have installed transport disruption information displays in 107 stations as of march 31 2011 we are
also striving to provide information via a variety of tools including train monitors the internet and mobile
phones




                information display during transport disruptions
                                                                                     information on the website



problem prevention measures taken by the facilities section
we are working to lessen the impact of transport disruptions with priorities on a reduction in the actual
number of incidents rapid restoration of services when incidents do occur and the provision of accurate
customer information in the facilities section in particular in order to reduce the severity of problems and
failures the following measures are being taken facilities strengthened or doubled to make them less likely
to cause problems establishment of a restoration base and an increased backup supply these initiatives
have resulted in a downward trend of transport disruptions in the tokyo metropolitan area
in our efforts to provide accurate customer information we are working to enhance and improve our
information displays
we will continue to strive for a reduction in transport disruptions by analyzing past occurrences and the
implementation of facility strengthening measures in terms of both software and hardware

transport services improvements
we are continuously striving to enhance the convenience of both shinkansen and conventional lines and
to reduce rushhour congestion through such measures as increasing the number of cars and introducing
widerbodied cars in december 2010 the tohoku shinkansen extension between hachinohe and shin
aomori was completed greatly reducing travel time between tokyo and aomori in the tokyo metropolitan
area convenience in the tokyo mega loop was enhanced by establishing a new musashino line direct
service extension to omiya station and easing congestion on the yokohama line by increasing the number
of night time operations
furthermore the new e5 series hayabusa highspeed shinkansen railcars were introduced in march
2011 with a 300 kmh service the fastest commercial operations in japan thereby enhancing our
overall service
during the fiscal year ended march 2011 the average level of intrain congestion during morning
commuting hours declined by 59 percentage points to 179 compared to the fiscal year ended march
1988 we will continue our efforts to secure reliable transport through a reduction of transport disruptions
and other means to meet perceived needs of customers
 tokyo mega loop musashino keiyo nambu and yokohama loop lines in the tokyo metropolitan area that connect with other railway
  company lines


service managers
jr east is increasing the number of service managers who make rounds of stations and are in position to
assist elderly customers and those not used to traveling these service managers provide relevant and
timely information and guidance and other finetuned services in times of emergency as well as during
regular operations as of april 1 2011 service managers are located at 47 stations

barrierfree stations
jr east has been working with local governments and other entities to install elevators at stations in
accordance with the barrierfree transportation law as of the end of march 2011 we had completed
installations in 469 stations




                      chuo line rapid platform in shinjuku station   jujo station upbound train platform


barrierfree railcars
to improve accessibility for persons with vision impairments in the fiscal year ended march 2006 we
installed braille maps and stickers indicating the passengers current location and the locations of various

appeal to overseas visitors
proposal of products that appeal to overseas visitors
in addition to the japan rail pass which allows unlimited travel on all jr lines we now offer the jr east
pass which allows unlimited usage within the jr east service area in autumn 2010 to coincide with the
shinshu destination campaign we introduced the reasonably priced 10000 for adults jr east pass
special flexible 3day ticket any three days can be chosen for travel from a total of 10 which together
with a strengthening of traveler recognition of the shinshu area brought about through our website and
foreign media usage has led to an increase in visitors
other bargains for overseas travelers include the suica  n ex package which provides access to central
tokyo and travel therein and since february 2011 the suica  monorail package which contains a suica

technology development toward new railway services

rd using smart station lab building
smart station lab building a new experimental facility with the same area and equipment as a
regular station was completed in june 2010 at the saitama citybased jr east group research
and development center in this facility it is now possible for us to conduct tests on customer flow
behavior lines of movement from free passageways through ticket gates concourses stairways
and train platforms that have previously been impossible in operating stations or within the
narrow confines of laboratories we are therefore now in a position to make overall assessments
of passenger behavior
currently we are also carrying out basic assessment tests with the goal of developing an
information system using smartphones and the introduction of light transmissive organic thinfilm
solar cells to the railway business




                                          smart station lab building



1 smartphone information system
we are currently carrying out research into station information systems utilizing smartphones and
augmented reality ar technology with such a system if passengers look at ar identification
markers on station floors and elsewhere through a smartphone information regarding locations
of ticket gates toilets and other facilities will be displayed on their smartphone screens using
ar technology in this way will enable information provision via smartphones even inside stations
where gps and electronic compasses often fail to function adequately in november 2011 a

2 basic assessment tests toward the introduction of light transmissive organic
    thinfilm solar cell to the railway business
we are currently conducting basic assessment tests on the potential for the introduction of
light transmissive organic thinfilm solar cells to the railway business compared to traditional
silicon inorganic solar cells organic solar cells have the following advantages heat emissions
during manufacturing are low resources are abundant expensive manufacturing equipment
is unnecessary the cells are light thin bendable glass is not used as a base and highly
transmissive which make it possible to introduce them without largescale station structural
reinforcements etc there is also the advantage that they can be used in station windows and
on platform ceilings without decreasing the flow of light at present the energy transformation
efficiency we have achieved is low and cannot compare with silicon cells but there is potential
for a considerable boost in power generation capabilities within several years given this we will
continue to plan for the future and consider their application in stations

rd regarding more comfortable seats
on commuter trains we have introduced such improvements as widening seats and clarifying
individual seat spaces so that as many passengers as possible can sit comfortably we found
however that there are many instances where passengers are made uncomfortable by others
sitting with their legs wide open leaning on their neighbors andor stretching out their legs we
also found out that some seated passengers are worried that they themselves might be causing
discomfort in others
as a result we designed and produced prototype seats that are comfortable to sit on and not
invasive to nearby passengers with the aim of balancing comfort and compromise with an eye to
commercialization from june 2011 we have been conducting trials on one car on the yamanote
line in order to verify the comfort durability cost etc of the seats




                                 the result of our pursuance of improved
                                 passenger comfort

  relationship with society




with communities
jr east is continuing its commitment to regional communities through its station renaissance program
which revitalizes stations that serve as the cores of their communities and thereby contribute to the
increased attraction of entire areas one such initiative was the transformation of tachikawa station into
a more userfriendly environment by increasing its barrierfree facilities creating the ecute tachikawa
commercial space and opening hotel mets tachikawa
on the yaesu side of tokyo station grantokyo north tower and south tower and granroof are
continuing to rise and develop north tower phase ii will be completed at the end of august 2012 and
granroof in autumn 2013 on the marunouchi side of the station work is now under way to totally restore
the station building to its original form an instation commercial zone gransta is also being developed in
combination the developments will be called tokyo station city under the concept of developing tokyo
station into a complete city our goal is to create a station that will serve as a transmission base for new
cultures while also forming a spectacular gateway to the metropolis of tokyo
we are also cooperating with local governments in the creation of new stations in line with their urban
planning and continuing with the improvement of existing station buildings in order to create free
passages based on requests from local authorities in the fiscal year ended march 2011 in coordination
with development projects in surrounding areas sawara station on the narita line was renewed and now
hosts a community center within the station this means that since our establishment in 1987 we have
introduced local government facilities into a total as of march 31 2011 of 81 stations station building
renewal projects were also continued with the construction of free passages in hitachi and suzumenomiya
stations on the joban and tohoku main lines respectively

railway overpasses
jr east continues to cooperate with local governmentplanned and implemented schemes for railway
overpasses these projects aim to both unify towns that are split by railway tracks and eliminate traffic
congestion thereby simultaneously improving the safety levels of both road and rail transportation along
the chuo line for example in a bid to unify towns and to eliminate congestion by decreasing the number
of level crossings we introduced a program of overpass construction between mitaka and tachikawa
stations in cooperation with the tokyo metropolitan government the entity responsible for the roads in
this area there used to be 18 level crossings along this approximately 131 km section but by november
2010 railway tracks had been elevated and all level crossings removed

rediscover local areas project
development of the rediscover local areas project
under thecreate togetherstrategy in which a clear division of roles is stipulated between jr east and
regional communities we are promoting the rediscover local areas project the aim of this scheme is
to create new markets that also take into account overseas visitors to japan and thereby bring about
increased flows of both visitors and goods among the tokyo metropolitan area and other regions
the jr east group has the following attributes railway networks that link japan    s various regions stations
that serve as centers of local communities business knowhow sales channels and advertising power that
all radiate out from the tokyo metropolitan area along with human resources that continuously make
social contributions as members of local communities the rediscover local areas project utilizes jr          s
unique abilities to fully exploit the traditional cultures festivals techniques local produce and other
tangible and intangible tourist resources expand sales channels and promote the interactive exchange of
information among the tokyo metropolitan area and regional communities
during the fiscal year ended march 2010 jr east carried out development and renewal of its longstay
hotels and stations in the iwate tateyama and echigoyuzawa areas utilizing features unique to each
area we have thus pursued regional revitalization through our policy of cooperation with local residents
in the fiscal year ended march 2011 furthermore following the commencement of tohoku shinkansen
operations to aomori in collaboration with urban planning organizations in the city of aomori we opened
afactory a complex that consists of a craft center and market in the heart of the aomori waterfront
district in the craft center apples grown in aomori prefecture japan  s largest producer will be processed
into cider while in the market agricultural and other local products will be sold we are also proposing
to increase the tourist appeal of aomori in a tieup with the tabiichi travel package through which local
residents both propose and guide tours of as yet littleknown tourism resources
to stimulate increased interest throughout the tokyo metropolitan area furthermore in collaboration
with our destination and other marketing campaigns we are hosting a number of farm fresh markets at
locations such as ueno station and other central sites all of these efforts are aimed to increase tourism
through wider publicity of the attractions of japan  s various regions with these farm fresh markets we
at jr east are working to provide information in cooperation with local communities by holding tourism
publicity and other events and by utilizing our transport media including digital signage
we will continue to promote regional revitalization through cooperation with local governments
organizations producers and through the power of local communities including schools and companies

childcare support
childcare support facilitiessupport for working parents
as part of our urban development initiatives in cooperation with local communities jr east is supporting
the opening of childcare facilities such as nursery schools in locations within five minutes of stations
thereby enabling parents to balance childcare responsibilities and employment the total number of
childcare support facilities opened since 1996 reached 54 in april 2011 and further expansion is being
targeted nursery schools adjacent to stations have the advantage of enabling parents to drop off and
pick up their children on their way to or from work we have also noted an increase in the number of
children being dropped off and picked up by their fathers which demonstrates that our efforts in this field
are leading to an increased level of male participation in childcare we will continue to accommodate a
variety of childcarerelated needs and broaden the framework of our childcare initiatives to include not
only nursery schools but also kidsstation and station after school centers which take advantage of their
location near stations as well as nursery services such as our parentchild community cafés which can be
used by all people involved in childrearing regardless of whether they are working or not thus jr east will
actively contribute to local neighborhoods and enhance the values of the communities located adjacent to
our railway lines

  relationship with employees

demonstrating the power of human resources
in order to provide services that will satisfy customers it is vitally important for us to create an
environment where jr east     s personnel can fully exercise their abilities our success in enabling our people
to be able to personally decide what they need to achieve and then act on their decisions will determine
the future of our entire organization
we also have to face the fact that society is in a continual state of change and this includes both the
awareness of working people and their working environments as a result of this we believe that jr east
as a part of the nation  s infrastructure and as an organization that aims for extreme levels of safety must
constantly respond to the motivation of all our employees as they work to meet their responsibilities and
thereby bring about improved safety and increased customer satisfaction
jr east continues to work to provide an environment in which all employees can enjoy their jobs while

a company where people grow through their work from the perspectives of how to respond to the motivation
of each employee to meet challenges how to ensure a suitable worklife balance and how to make full use
of the diversity of our human resources in jr east vision 2020 jr east advocated the following goals the

encouraging of veteran employees to pass on their technical knowledge and their skills to the next generation
of employees who will shoulder the burdens of the 21st century the utilization and fostering of diverse human
resources and the instigation of a strategic reform of our human resources system

recruitment
jr easts main supports are the capabilities of each and every employee in regard to human resources it
is jr easts basic philosophy to employ people based chiefly on their personalities and abilities and then
to steadily nurture them until they reach the full flowering of their abilities because of the large number of
employees reaching retirement age by the end of this fiscal year march 2012 and the constant necessity
of human resources development and the transference of knowledge and technologies to the next
generation we have recruited 1820 new employees

jr east technical academy
in order to motivate our young employees and encourage them develop into professionals capable
of playing leading roles in all fields of railway technology in march 2009 we established the jr east
technical academy the third year class that started in may 2011 consists of 29 employees from 10
technological fields who will spend the year on leave from their regular positions in order to concentrate
on technological studies at the head office the program has been designed to enable participants to
thoroughly learn the theory and structure of their individual professional fields as well as to provide
them with a comprehensive overview of railway technologies and systems in general through research
at universities and from practical training sessions at manufacturers furthermore we hope to enable all
participants to acquire a broad range of knowledge

skills development
the development of human resources and the steady but continuous introduction of new technologies and
skills are vital to the sustainable growth of the jr east group based on a perspective of nurturing quality
through work we are striving to enhance the organizational power of the group and to develop human
resources capable of shouldering the burdens of the future with this in mind we constantly conduct
training programs at our general education center and in branch offices and many kinds of seminars at
our head office and as part of our support for all employees to set their own challenges in regard to
selfeducation and to thereby heighten their abilities we offer both internal and external correspondence
courses the internal courses are aimed at the acquisition of knowledge and skills directly connected to
our employeesduties while the external courses target the acquisition of knowledge indispensable for
businesspeople in terms of management knowhow qualifications acquirement languages and office
automation

my project
in order to encourage our employees to face the challenges of taking the next steps in their careers in
january 2011 we upgraded our small groups and proposal activities and initiated the my project program
this program is comprised of three aspects selfstarting freedom of method and importance of process
with the fruit being the employees personal growth the project is based on the belief that the tackling of
improvements in itself is an opportunity for the fostering of human resources and thereby aims to nurture
employees capable of thinking and acting independently

skills training centersdevelop engineers for future railways
integral to our efforts to ensure that veteran employees pass on their technologies and skills to the next
generation of technical staff who will carry the burdens of future railways is our establishment of skills
training centers designed to support the continuity of railwayspecific knowledge in individual workplaces
in our rolling stock maintenance center for example railway car mockups such as power collection
equipment door openingclosing devices braking equipment etc have been set up while at our facilities
maintenance center railway facilities including tracks turnouts platforms overhead line equipment signal
devices etc have been installed so training sessions can take place in virtually real environments
by the fiscal year ending 2014 we plan to establish a total of no less than 104 skills training centers
including those that make use of existing facilities the development of this project commenced in the

  compliance

basic concept of compliance
in 2005 jr east adopted the policy on legal and regulatory compliance and corporate ethics as the
group s corporate activity guidelines concomitantly we established compliance hotlines both inside and
outside the company for internal reporting and have promoted efforts on compliance
moreover in 2009 and in 2010 all employees of jr group were given education to increase their
awareness about compliance
jr east group has been making a concerted effort for further promoting compliance management
including the thorough inspection of legal matters in all aspects of its business since 2009 and the ensuring
of proper business conduct with the use ofbasic matter confirmation support sheetdesigned for regular
checking of important matters by individual departments since 2011

formulation and revision of the compliance action plan
in order to enhance the effectiveness of the policy originally formulated in 2005 we developed and
distributed the first version of our compliance action plan document that summarized what we consider
to be desirable levels of conduct for all group employees after the series of shinanogawa power plant
incidents however a revised edition was published in 2009 which incorporated such aspects as the
necessity of constant awareness of potential problems adherence to laws and regulations as basis for
actions and confirmation of the contents of reports

full inspection of legal matters and a continuous review of overall work
we conducted full inspections of our compliance in regard to all our operations including group
companies starting with this series of full inspections jr east group is promoting continuous reviews of
all its operations based on laws and regulations internal rules and social norms since 2011 based on the
above mentioned thorough inspection of legal matters jr east has created abasic matters confirmation
sheet   which lists the matters requiring regular checking to ensure business is continuously conducted on
a propper manner

strengthening compliance education
jr east conducts regular compliance education sessions and intends to further reinforce the system in
order to specifically raise employee awareness in terms of compliance in 2009 we made available to
all group employees an education program based on our revised compliance action plan we intend to
continue to offer education in line with the actual conditions in individual workplaces
from 2010 we delivered a compliance questionnaire to all jr east employees in an effort to raise their
awareness of compliance issues

shinanogawa power station incident
on march 10 2009 jr east received an administrative sanction from the director of the hokuriku regional
development bureau of the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism the sanction was
issued in accordance with the river act and included the revocation of a permit to draw water from the
shinano river because the company  s water intake had exceeded the maximum allowed quantity at our
hydroelectric plant shinanogawa power station the collective name for the senju ojiya and ojiya daini
power plants in ojiya and tokamachi cities niigata prefecture subsequent to receipt of this sanction we
have taken corrective actions in accordance with the directions in the sanction and have endeavored to
implement measures to prevent recurrence and to cultivate close cooperation with the local communities
on april 2 2010 with the consent of the parties involved we filed an application for water intake permit
with the director of the hokuriku regional development bureau of the ministry of land infrastructure
transport and tourism on june 9 2010 we received the permit and the shinanogawa power station
resumed drawing water from the shinano river and restarted power generation

recurrence and we are sincerely committed to foster harmony with environment and enhance coexistence
with the communities

independent assurance report




jr east has redefined its boundary for energy consumption by sorting out
the energy used in transportation that used in nontransportation activities
and that supplied to other companies this has also helped clarify the
boundary of its group companies and we believe that the calculated figures
now present a truer picture of jr east  s and its group companiesenergy
consumption and co2 emissions
group companiesquantitative environmental data are however only
shown in thejr east group      s environmental impactsection because
the environmental impacts of the group companies are much smaller
than those of jr east and it is not always easy to describe the impacts of
the group companies that are engaged in diverse businesses it may be
understandable that focus has so far been placed on the impacts of jr
east nonetheless taking into account the fact that the jr east group   s non

 measures as a group while upholding the issue of global warming as one
 of our priority issues in business as a business operator which uses a large
