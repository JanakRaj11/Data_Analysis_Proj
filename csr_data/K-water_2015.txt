also it is important that various industries knowledge and technology are integrated throughout the entire water circulation process
in particular water related technology has a direct impact on the environment and individuals health therefore verified technological     within these global water crises korea has its own risk factors seasonal and regional rainfall changes can be dramatic so water usage
development is required in addition customer demands for the safety taste and healthiness of tap water need to be satisfied               and management is challenging meanwhile the deterioration of facilities causes a worsening distrust in regards to tap water as a result

account needs to be also taken of the fact that countries and regions have differing water related laws and regulations as well as
differing social and environmental aspects therefore when entering an overseas market these requirement must be met                       business opportunities in water industry
