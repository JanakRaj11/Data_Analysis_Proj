  through which the pipeline is routed proved to be beneficial they were useful in explaining and dispelling various concerns
  related to the implementation of the project the basic and most frequently asked question was about the compensation                  gazsystem sa actively participates in local community initiatives one of the projects in this area is a grant competition known
  payment date the key information provided therefore concerned clarification of principles of determining compensation               as the natural energy fund whose key objective is to cofinance the best regional environmental protection ideas in 2012
  for damages to landowners also many of the questions were related to the use of subsidies from the agency for restructuring          in the second edition of the competition 19 projects were nominated and 13 best ideas were rewarded with financial grants

  fulfil in order to be eligible for compensation in respect of any losses they may have incurred relation between the timing of        eur 1223 thousand
  submission to the arma and the property release date another issue which required explanation was the difference between
  consideration for easement and compensation for damages as for additional steps it might be beneficial to stimulate a greater
  involvement of local authorities in providing information as not everyone has access to the internet that was the channel
  of communication preferred by the authorities

 the company also independently organised tenders for the purchase of pipes and fittings which resulted in concluding direct         lasów interconnection point at the polishgerman border

          investments of gazsystem sa

in 2012 gazsystem sa was actively working towards the development of gas interconnections with adjacent systems

poland  slovakia interconnection

gazsystem sa is examining the possibility of building a gas interconnection between poland and slovakia to this end the company
has established a cooperation with the slovak operator eustream as currently poland has no direct connection with slovakia the
polishslovak interconnection is part of the northsouth gas corridor its implementation would help strengthen energy security and
competition in the gas market in central europe by increased capabilities to meet gas demand offered by the newly established
supply route and access to new sources of gas

the project is now at the preinvestment stage a business analysis of the investment was completed in october 2012 while a feasibility
study for the proposed investment is planned to be completed in 2013

poland  czech republic interconnection

the company is also looking into the possibility of upgrading the poland  czech republic interconnection in this regard
gazsystem sa is working with the czech operator  net4gas sro the connection between poland and the czech republic is
also a part of the northsouth gas corridor its development is of strategic importance as it will not only support further integration of
european gas markets but also enable the diversification of import supply sources and routes

the upgrade of the pipeline between poland and the czech republic will be of key importance for the development of a free and
competitive market for natural gas in the region the project is at the preinvestment stage a business analysis of the investment was         declaration of cooperation with plinacro doo

in 2012 steps were taken with a view to gradually phasing out the gas odorisation service the service was no longer provided in the
branch in poznan                                                                                                                                                     as of 1 july 2012 the gas day has runs from 600 am to 600 am the following day
in the coming years the discontinuation of the service is planned for customers in the remaining branches

transmission tariff in 2012

efficient management and cost reduction coupled with wellstructured financing of the companys investment project largely
relying on nonreturnable subsidies from the european union contributed to another reduction of the transmission tariffs applied by
gazsystem sa in december 2012 the president of the energy regulatory office approved a new reduced tariff for gas transmission
services

under the new tariff of gazsystem sa the cost of transporting 1000 m3 11 thousand kwh of natural gas went down by 325 as
compared to the previously applicable tariff

the design of the new tariff for gas transmission services is intended to support the process of energy market liberalisation and the
changes introduced in the new transmission network code tnc

similarly as in 2011 the tariff approved in 2012 is an entryexit tariff which means that the billing for gas transmission is aligned with eu
standards and based on charges applied at system entry and exit points this tariff model results from the provisions of the third energy
package and regulation 7152009 of the european parliament and the council

the division into tariff groups no longer applies under the new tariff the new regime also introduced a significant reduction of
adjustment coefficients applicable to fixed charge rate for shortterm contracts semiannual quarterly and monthly which will
result in lower cost of such services for the transmission network user furthermore the charges for gas transportation to and from
underground gas storage facilities have been substantially decreased the tariff no 6 for transmission services has been effective as
of 1 january 2013 and will remain in force until 30 september 2013

  how would you judge the cooperation with the partners
  i would like to emphasise that the cooperation between gazsystem sa and ontras and the involvement of national
  regulatory authorities throughout the process of creating the concept of the pilot project adhered to the best practice standards
  this in turn translates into the highest quality of services provided by operators to market participants


new product at polishczech interconnection in cieszyn

in early september 2012 gazsystem sa in agreement with the czech transmission system operator  net4gas started to offer
dayahead capacity to market participants in response to the expectations of the market and as a next step in the process of
adapting the services to the eu guidelines the availability of this type of capacity will result in optimised utilisation of the technical
capabilities of this interconnection

in order to make the investment decision concerning this project possible gazsystem sa and the czech transmission system operator
net4gas carried out coordinated and nondiscriminatory capacity allocation procedures at the turn of 20092010 the adopted
approach ensured compliance with the third party access tpa rules in accordance with the guidelines of ergeg the european
regulators group for electricity and gas following the procedures transmission agreements were concluded for a term of 15 years

implementation of eu regulations

the european union is pursuing the process of building a common energy market which is expected to connect all the member
states the implementation of subsequent elements of eu legislation affects the business and regulatory environment in which the
company operates
                                                                                                                                                                           network code
the main task before european legislation is to liberalise the natural gas market the measures aimed at this direction are set forth in

platforms and capacity allocation platforms which will contribute to the harmonisation of practices and increase the liquidity and
integration of national markets

it is expected that the next steps for the liberalisation of energy markets in europe will also result from the proposals made by the
european commission in its november 2012 communication on the internal energy market

one of the conditions of a liberalised and wellfunctioning gas market in the eu is a welldeveloped infrastructure enabling gas
transmission between the national and regional markets according to the demand of the participants                                       contract execution process and contracting of the services provided by gazsystem sa

                     president of the energy regulatory office




last year was a time of intense and fruitful cooperation between the transmission system operator and the market regulator
our work in 2012 focused on the harmonisation and refinement of the rules for a new model of the gas market and on the
implementation of provisions of the transmission network code the conceptual and analytical work done by gazsystem sa
was of fundamental importance

as a result of this work gazsystem sa submitted the new transmission network code to the regulator for approval the
code introduced a number of improvements for market participants while creating the conditions for the development of
competition and liquidity in the domestic gas market with the introduction of the socalled virtual point which creates the
conditions for the purchase and sale of gas in isolation from its physical location the rules on the use of the transmission system
were simplified and access was facilitated for new market entrants these changes enabled the launch of gas trading on the
polish power exchange and exemption from the obligation to submit wholesale tariffs for gas for approval by the president of
ero as of the beginning of 2013 new solutions introduced under the tnc contribute to the harmonisation of rules on the polish
gas market and enhance the cooperation between the transmission system operator and other operators at both national and
european levels

  what changes to the network code are most significant from the customer perspective
  the network code has introduced a new model for contracting services with gazsystem sa the execution of a new framework
  transmission contract has been limited to a formal registration of the customer and specific entry and exit points may be added
  to the contract at any time and according to customers needs by the means of capacity and transmission ability allocation
  for each customer we have consolidated all their previous contracts into one so as to ensure consistent and uniform principles
  and portfolio balancing
                                                                                                                                                                  joanna kijas
  the new tnc creates the possibility of transporting gas from physical entry points to a virtual point and from a virtual point to                               president of the management board of the storage system operator in 2012
  physical exit points by two separate entities owing to this arrangement the customer of gazsystem sa may purchase gas at
  an otc virtual point or at a dedicated point for the gas exchange

  in order to enhance the flexibility of the balancing system we have provided for a balancing services market in the network                   the signing of the agreement is an important step towards the liberalisation of the gas market in poland the sso is one of the
  code which enables physical balancing of the system by gazsystem sa the users have been afforded the possibility of                       few operators in europe offering combined storage and transmission services the terms of cooperation agreed between the
  offering system services to gazsystem sa in particular by declaring the delivery or reduced offtake of gas at a specific                operators will allow the implementation of integrated services in accordance with the customers requirements and ensure safe
  physical location which will help them balance their portfolios while allowing us to balance the gas demand and ensure stable               operation of the transmission and storage systems
  operation of the system

  another important element of the network code concerns the supplier switching process whereby transmission capacity may be
  used directly by gas customers under the network code capacity is separated from gas volumes and accordingly customers
  may choose at their discretion where they wish to source the gas or purchase the commodity eg at the exchange and
  transport it through our system this creates the conditions for real competition between suppliers to attract the customer the
  capacity that follows the customer enables the optimisation of supply portfolio by such means as purchases at the gas exchange
  or the otc market we have indications that these new solutions have been welcomed by our customers and we are pleased to
  see positive reactions of the market to the changes we proposed



cooperation with the polish power exchange

in january 2012 gazsystem sa started the cooperation with the polish power exchange with a view to creating a gas exchange
market in poland under the cooperation scheme the companies established working groups responsible for the preparation of
legal organisational and technical solutions to enable gas exchange trading detailed terms of the cooperation were set forth in the
agreement signed between gazsystem sa and the polish power exchange on 11 october 2012
