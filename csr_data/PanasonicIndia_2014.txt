risk management approach



r      isk management strategies at panasonic india aim to insulate business
       goals from external and internal risks such as fluctuating economic
       conditions business risks geopolitical risks and natural disasters we
cannot expect stable growth of our company without taking into account the
impacts from climate change resource depletion and the destruction of
ecosystems we strongly endorse the disclosure of risk related information in
the public domain as a suitable method to improve the transparency of our
business processes and also promote practices that would instill confidence in
our customers and stakeholders our policy on product quality and safety
consistently strives to deliver the best quality products across our complete
range of products and our quality management system aims to achieve the
highest possible level of customer satisfaction around the globe
our policy on responsible sourcing guides our business operations to ensure that
every sourced or extracted material used in the manufacturing process comes
only from shortlisted suppliers who have met all the relevant compliances and
regulations this practice of responsible sourcing enables us to work closely with
our suppliers and helps build trust with our customers as they become confident
that the products they use come from a responsible source these policies are
some of the methods adopted by us as part of our risk management strategy
some of the other potential risks that could affect our business are

  1   risks associated with economic conditions

the demand for products sold by panasonic india is subject to economic
downturns and geopolitical risks that would also have an effect on our overall
business in terms of risks and opportunity this has been seen in the recent
global economic crisis that had an impact on the economy of india resulting in
a slowdown in the indian economy as well that was compounded by various
bottlenecks in the indian economy as well
this economic slowdown also had a result on the growth of the consumer
durables industry that panasonic india is a part of in the year 2011 and 2012 the
annual gdp growth in india had slowed to less than 7 from the growth rate in
the previous years of over 9 this had resulted in a slowdown in the growth of
the consumer durables industry which stagnated at us73 billion in sales for two
consecutive years in fy 11 and 12 such slowdowns could pose significant risks
for panasonic india and in order to mitigate these risks panasonic india continues
to broaden their product range as well as continue to maintain high levels of
quality and safety to keep consumer confidence in their products
additionally as we sell our products in the biggest economy in the south 
southeast asia region panasonic india expects a stable economic growth of
india driven by increased private investments and a boost in competitiveness in
the private sector thus even though there has been a recent slowdown in the
consumer durables industry the strong economic growth projected for india
combined with the various risk management strategies adopted by panasonic
india should result in sustained growth for the company in india



                                                                                      sustainability report 201314   3

                                                                                  risk management approach




                                      2   risks associated with business

                                    the consumer electronics segment is one of the biggest and most innovative
                                    sectors of the indian economy thus resulting in huge competition between
                                    players panasonic india assumes that our competitors in this sector are financially
                                    strong technologically capable and have good marketing resources at their
                                    disposal thus we assume that any product with a fair price offering an
                                    improvement over the existing technology has the capability to outsell their
                                    competitors and capture market share panasonic india therefore has to identify
                                    strategies to maintain their competitive edge and continue to gain market share
                                    behind those technological advances that provide a competitive edge to
                                    companies are the practices related to recruiting and retaining the most skilled
                                    employees in the market our success as a business organization depends on
                                    the people who work with us including professionals in the fields of research
                                    development sales logistics and management the competition for acquiring
                                    highly skilled people is intense and panasonic india has identified many
                                    strategies to attract or retain people of the highest skill including performance
                                    evaluations employee feedback systems and trainings
                                    in order to mitigate risks associated with our market presence we have actively
                                    been broadening our range of products for the india market including
                                    introduction of smartphones designed specifically for the indian market a
                                    major move to expand our market presence has been the acquisition of anchor
                                    electricals pvt lt that is a wellknown brand in india with a wide range of
                                    electrical products such as switches wires lighting fans and many other
                                    products this major acquisition in india aligns with our strategy of introducing
                                    new products and is part of our risk management strategy for addressing risks
                                    associated with our business

t      he expected growth of the global population to nine billion by 2050
       coupled with the increase in usage of natural resources at an
       unprecedented rate would require a total of one and a half earths to
support the rising demand although technology has accelerated
industrialization throughout the globe and has contributed to the current
pressures on the resources of the planet it is no surprise that technology may
be the only way to mitigate negative environmental impacts of human activities
and demand this can be aided by encouraging people to give consideration to
reducing wasted energy while enjoying the benefits of convenience and
comfort in their daily lives living an ecolifestyle doesnt mean people need to
compromise on comfort and this is the belief guides panasonic in india and
across the world

intelligent eco sensors termed as eco navi is the new technology by
panasonic standing for ecology  energy saving navigation
which automatically operates itself in the most efficient and
energy saving way by improving the previous intelligent
inverters already impressive benefits econavi conveniently
optimizes the performance of appliances while greatly
reducing electricity and water consumption products based
on eco navi technology ie air conditioners refrigerators
and washing machines will allow our customers to live their
lives without contributing to unnecessary pollution and
waste and also save them money in the long run we believe
such innovations would drive the market and purchasing
behavior of customers towards ecominded products the
technology uses intelligent sensors such as human activity
sensors and sunlight sensors which is able to monitor human
location movements absence and sunlight intensity that leads to
energy savings up to 38
                                                                                            intelligent sensors

have to rely on airconditioning for longer durations of time consequently air
conditioning is used on a significant scale in india and such usage creates a
significant negative impact on the environment due to increased energy            human activity
consumption this energy consumption and usage of air conditioning makes              sensors
the environment even hotter by contributing to global warming through the
discharge of gasses such as carbon dioxide co2 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs
and hydro chlorofluorocarbons hfcs the co2 is emitted due to electricity
generation and cfcs and hfcs are used as refrigerants in air
conditioning units these gases have a negative impact on the
                                                                                          sunlight sensors
environment as they are part of the greenhouse gases that
trap heat and lead to depletion of the ozone layer this
problem is multiplied due to the fact that the hotter our           energy savings up to
environment gets the more reliant we become on air
conditioning systems therefore our engineers have worked
on a technology that would reduce these negative impacts
without compromising the efficiency in cooling

                                     body adapts to the marginal changes in the temperatures temperature wave
                                     technology allows airconditioners to change the set temperature from 033
                                     degree celsius to 133 degree celsius which results in significant energy
                                     savings without compromising the comfort level air conditioners running for
                                     longer durations under less sunny conditions lead to significant energy wastage
                                     econavi sunlight sensors takes into account the current weather conditions
                                     and adjusts the set temperature accordingly for example if conditions are
                                     sunnier the sensors would decrease the set temperature by 1 degree celsius
                                     and if there are less sunny conditions the sensors would increase the set
                                     temperature by 1 degree celsius

panasonic smartphones
although mobile internet connectivity has existed on a small scale for over 10
years in india it was often considered a luxury rather than a necessity since
then much progress has been made with india entering a new digital age and
the usage of internet of gone up dramatically from the citizens of this country
with at least 200 million internet users which is more than the united states
and second only to china studies suggest that 84 of internet users access
websites through mobile phones we have recently launched android
smartphones t41 p41 and p61 that are available at relatively low prices which
would allow users to gain access to products and services in the field of travel
education retail and even agriculture that were otherwise not available to most
users we believe the scope for internet devices in india is ever expanding like
in the case of travel bookings while booking a rail or plane ticket once took
hours of queuing or paying an agent now the process can be done through a
smartphone making the governments railway ticketing website the biggest e
commerce portal in the country

panasonic a responsible corporate citizen at each step




    responsible sourcing
panasonic india takes pride in selling products of highest quality longer
durability and at a fair price but we also do it responsibly we take into account
how our business effects the environment and our stakeholders at large selling
products without ensuring traceability of the components and unsustainable
manufacturing would not only set a bad example in the electronics industry but
also have an adverse impact on the environment and society
our policy on responsible sourcing guides our business operations to ensure
that every material whether sourced or extracted used in the manufacturing
process comes only from shortlisted suppliers who have met all the relevant
compliances and regulations this practice of responsible sourcing enables us to
work closely with our suppliers and helps build trust with our customers as they
become confident that the products they use come from a responsible source
every supplier is required to follow to a standard purchase agreement which
includes the requirement of compliance to our green procurement standard
that ensures all our suppliers and vendors are appropriately screened and
selected through a transparent and unbiased process each potential supplier is
assessed on parameters such as safety environmental impacts quality
competitive pricing and meeting agreed delivery dates in the year 1999 our
company first issued green procurement standard which state our companys
preference to procure from suppliers who are proactive in reducing their
environmental impact our green procurement standard requests our suppliers
to establish an environmental management system and ensure comprehensive
chemical substance management as well as to expedite resource recycling
biodiversity conservation and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissionsbeing
aware of the need to spread these initiatives across our supply chain we also
request our suppliers to encourage their upstream business partners to reduce
their environmental impacts

well as the addition of an additional 90 days of unpaid leave           employees
time giving our employees as much as six months of time at
home before returning to work we have also instituted a dropoff
program that gives an employee who is working late the chance to get a free
ride home no matter how far he or she lives from office also parental leave is
offered to employees both at corporate offices and at plant level to provide
employees freedom to contribute to the care of their children in the reporting
period 32 male employees and 9 female employee availed parental leave the
impact of these initiatives is seen in the fact that we have a return rate of 100
percent for employees returning from parental leave reinforcing our belief that
such benefits allow us to retain our talented employee workforce

     flexible office timing our policy on flexible office timing encourages
employees to maintain a worklife balance and promote the culture of self
discipline conventionally employees are expected to work for eight hour shift
but flexitimings will give our employees more freedom with regard to their in
and out time without compromising their presence in their core office timings
core office timings approximately constitute of 50 of the total working hours
and the remaining hours can be chosen by employees as per their convenience
flexitimings has been beneficial to panasonic india in terms of increased
efficiency and motivation ever since the introduction of flexitiming policy we
have encountered reduced turnover rate absenteeism and also have
experienced untroubled process in attracting and retaining talent
flexitiming have enabled our employees to practice a healthy work and life
balance as they get available time to effectively meet their family and personal
commitment we have observed increased productivity from our employees as
they are in a position avoid rush hours in their long commute making it a win
win situation for both employer and employee

     grievance mechanism every organization including panasonic india is
exposed to the potential risk of objections and disputes with our stakeholders
inside or outside the organization from employees suppliers consumers local
communities and others hence having in place an effective grievance
mechanism helps in addressing issues raised in disputes and helps maintain the
faith of our stakeholders in the company any dispute needs to be tackled with
the right approach or it can lead to major issues that could have a negative
impact on the company both in short and long term

                                     in order to avoid such situations we have in place a robust grievance procedure
                                     where a grievance of an employee is screened at four layers

the presence of greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the atmosphere have now
reached an unprecedented level several scientific reports have confirmed that
mankind as a species have single handedly altered earths natural cycles and is
the predominant cause for global warming india as an emerging economy along
with other developing nations would have responsibility in reducing carbon
emissions in order to keep global warming within the 2 degrees celsius 18
degree fahrenheit cap this means ghg emissions across the global energy
sector need to drop by onethird by 2030 and just over onehalf by 2050 to keep
global mean temperature within the 2 degrees celsius cap else mankind would
have to face irreversible changes in the climate we take this matter of great
concern and we realize that major businesses can play a tremendous role in
managing and mitigating their emissions carbon dioxide co2 is the primary
greenhouse gas emitted through human activities carbon dioxide is naturally
present in the atmosphere as part of the earths carbon cycle the natural
circulation of carbon among the atmosphere oceans soil plants and animals

managing greenhouse gas emissions ghg as it does not only have a negative
impact on the business strategy but can also affect the corporate social
responsibility csr rating of an organization the depleting water sources is a
matter of great concern for panasonic india and it is our objective to reduce the
consumption of water through introducing our waterefficient consumer
products our zero discharge practice and so on running our business operation
in india is subject to scrutiny with regard to the usage of water for instance a
major plant was shut down due to a large number of protests as it was extracting
too much ground water that sent a strong wave of message across the industry
                   as the availability fresh water is becoming increasingly scarce
                   we have employed rainwater harvesting facilities to reduce our
                   dependency on ground water during fy 201314 we stored
                   approximately 82960 meter cube of rainwater through our
                   rainwater harvesting facilities whereas we extracted
                   approximately 21422 meter cube from two bore well rather
                   than extracting it from restricted water bodies or protected
                   areas flow meters have been installed at both the bore well to
                   measure daily water use the total volume of water recycled
                   and reused by panasonic india in fy 201314 was 6140 meter
                   cube the principle of zero discharge is recycling of all
industrial wastewater this means that wastewater will be treated and used again
in the process this practice of the water reuse wastewater will not be released on
the sewer system or surface water
at panasonic technopark we are recycling 100 waste water before sending it
in the sewage treatment plant stp and effluent treatment plant etp
we have installed sewage treatment facilities at technopark that is capable to
treat upto 925 kiloliters of sewage per day and the effluent treatment plant is
capable to treat 27 kiloliters of sewage per day domestic sewage generate on
daily basis are sent to be treated in stp and industrial process and cooling
system effluent water are sent for treatment in etp further etp treated water
                                                                                               intelligent sensors in
use for gardening purpose to develop green belt in technopark stp treated
water use for toilet flushing and green belt development as well there is no                     washing machines
any domestic and effluent waste water discharge from technopark                                        reduce waste
panasonic india has made efforts to conserve water resources in the production
process but also in the technology used in our products for example the
econavi technology used in our washing machines are equipped with load                   cloth load
sensor that detects the amount of clothing and sets the water level and a water             sensor
temperature sensor that uses water temperature to determine the required
operation time when the water temperature is high detergent dissolves
quickly so a short washing time is enough to clean clothes the primary function
of the cloth load sensor is to determine the weight of the clothes put in the
washing machine when the load is small the water level is lowered to save                    water temperature
water the optimum volume of water for the load is selected so no water is                          sensor
wasted the water temperature sensor functions to save time and energy
when the water temperature is high detergent dissolves quickly so washing       reduces water
time is reduced econavi determines how easily detergent dissolves and        consumption by
selects the optimum operation time all of our washing machines with                at least
econavi sensors increases water efficiency and reduces water consumption
by at least 23

    product quality and safety
the ongoing agenda of corporate sustainability is insisting companies to think
and innovate a new approach to tackle the increasing expectations of the
stakeholders the world have witnessed unprecedented advances in technology
and rising consumption and is also facing the twin challenges of climate change
and resource depletion consumer products contribute significantly to
environmental waste and degradation and we believe our practice in product
quality will encourage our competitors to play a proactive part as well external
pressure from regulators and governments and an increasingly knowledgeable
customer base have motivated us to disclose the performance tests of our
products which is performed in our laboratories followed by a result
confirmation performed by a third party laboratory
our emphasis on product quality and safety is not only met through compliance
with applicable laws and regulation but also ensuring that our products are
more efficient in terms of durability energy consumption and water
consumption the electrical components of our air conditioners such as
compressor fan motor capacitor pcb and electrical cables are ul
underwriters laboratories approved and iec international
electrotechnical commission certified which are in compliance with
the safety standards the metals and materials used in our products
are rohs compliant we take pride in our engineers and designers as
they constantly thrive to innovate and develop products better than
its predecessors for example our highsale model 15 ton 3 star split
model uc series has become relatively energy efficient by reducing
its energy consumption by 90 watts from its last year version we
believe such efforts towards the improvement of our products would help in
maintaining relationships with our customers
our objective is to create a framework which seeks to create production
techniques that are not just efficient but are essentially waste free we
recognize that a cradle to cradle production encompasses all material inputs
and outputs as technical or biological nutrients technical nutrients can be
recycled or reused with no loss of quality and biological nutrients composted or
consumed a cradle to grave approach refers to a company taking responsibility
for the disposal of goods it has produced but not necessarily putting products
constituent components back into service
the components of our products largely consists of metals and minerals and
their sourcing is a delicate task as it any defective component adds to both
environmental risk and health risk the quality assurance qa team plays an
important role in determining reliable sources as it poses a thorough
understanding of the panasonic standards through conducting procedures to
shortlist supplier who meet the panasonic standards restriction of hazardous
substances directive rohs is a directive passed from the european union in
2006 which is applicable to companies operating under the global electronics
industry restricting them for the use of high concern substances such as
cadmium lead and mercury panasonic india takes in account the parts and
substances that might produce an environmental or social impact therefore the
qa team ensures that all products and parts must comply as per the rohs
regulation and panasonic safety standards

    responsible management of ewaste
the developing countries in the east are home to the worlds largest ewaste
dumping ground with approximately 50m tonnes of unwanted electronic
devices dumped every year though some of the devices are repaired and sold
the majority of the waste are broken down into their components at the cost of
the environment and health and wellbeing of the people a considerable
amount of ewaste is left as heaps of toxic waste with the current trend of
increasing demands for electronics by the middleclass consumers in china and
india it is estimated that by 2017 the annual amount of ewaste generated
would be 65m tonnes it is also estimated that by 2015 the national capital
region ncr of india would generate approximately 50000 tonnes per annum

10 is recycled
we realize that it is a growing problem and we have made a significant amount

nature such as out of warranty products spare parts and components damaged
and discarded products end of life products within system and take back
program products initiating the ewaste process requires the recycling units to
pick up materials from the mother warehouses and assessing the salvage value
that is performed every month
