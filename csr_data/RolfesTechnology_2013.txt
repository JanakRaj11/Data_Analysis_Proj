this financial year with quite a few heartening
accomplishments that have set us apart from our peers

registered a steady growth from last year with gross
profit margins also showing marked improvement

             of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and at fair value through other
             comprehensive income and incorporate the principal accounting policies set out below

             the accounting policies applied conform with ifrs and are consistent with those followed in the preparation

     12     basis of consolidation

             the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities
             including special purpose entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries control is achieved where
             the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain
             benefits from its activities

             income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated
             statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of
             disposal as appropriate total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the
             company and to the noncontrolling interests even if this results in the noncontrolling interests having a
             deficit balance

             when necessary adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting
             policies into line with those used by other members of the group

             all intragroup transactions balances income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation

             over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions the carrying amounts of the groups
             interests and the noncontrolling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the
             subsidiaries any difference between the amount by which the noncontrolling interests are adjusted and
             the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners
             of the company

             when the group loses control of a subsidiary the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference
             between

              the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained
               interest and

              the previous carrying amount of the assets including goodwill and liabilities of the subsidiary and any
               noncontrolling interests

             when assets of the subsidiary are carried at revalued amounts of fair values and the related cumulative gain
             or loss has been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity the amounts
             previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are accounted for as if
             the company had directly disposed of the relevant assets ie reclassified to profit or loss or transferred
             directly to retained earnings as specified by applicable ifrss the fair value of any investment retained in
             the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for
             subsequent accounting under ias 39  financial instruments recognition and measurement or when
             applicable the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a jointly controlled entity

             initial recognition and measurement

             all business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method the cost of the business
             combination are the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given liabilities incurred or assumed
             and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree costs directly
             attributable to the business combination are expensed as incurred except the costs to issue debt which
             are amortised as part of the effective interest and costs to issue equity which are included in equity
             identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
             measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling
             interest

             contingent consideration is included in the cost of the business combination at fair value determined at
             the date of acquisition subsequent changes to the assets liabilities or equity which arise as a result of the
             contingent consideration are not effected against goodwill unless they are valid measurement period
             adjustments the interest of noncontrolling shareholders may be measured either at fair value or at the
             noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets the choice of
             measurement basis is made on an acquisitionbyacquisition basis when a business combination is
             achieved in stages the groups previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value
             on the date the group attains control and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss

             where the previously held interest was classified as an availableforsale financial asset the cumulative fair
             value adjustments recognised to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are recognised
             in profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment at the acquisition date the excess of the cost of the
             business combination over the groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and
             contingent liabilities is recognised as goodwill in accordance with the groups accounting policy for
             goodwill the acquisition date is the date on which the group effectively obtains control of the acquiree
             the excess of the fair value of the net identifiable assets and contingent liabilities of the entity acquired over
             the cost of acquisition results in a bargain purchase which is recognised immediately in profit or loss

             subsequent measurement

             if the initial accounting for business combinations has been determined provisionally then these provisional
             amounts are adjusted during the measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and
             circumstances that existed as of the date of acquisition that if known would have affected the amounts
             initially recognised the measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the group
             obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date subject
             to a maximum of one year

             current financial assets and the following financial liabilities borrowings trade and other payables and
             other current financial liabilities

             the group recognises a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when the
             group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument

             fair value

             where financial instruments are recognised at fair value the instruments are measured at the price that
             should be received to sell on asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
             participants on measurement date fair values have been determined as follows

              where market prices are available these have been used

              where market prices are not available fair values have been determined using valuation techniques
               incorporating observable market inputs or discounting expected cash flows at market rates

             financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value with any resultant gain or loss
             recognised in profit or loss the net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or
             interest earned on the financial asset

             fair value measurement hierarchy

             ifrs 7 requires certain disclosures which require the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities
             measured at fair value using fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making
             the fair value measurement the fair value hierarchy has the following levels

              quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1

              inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either
               directly ie as a price or indirectly ie derived from prices level 2 and

              inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs
               level 3

             the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial asset or financial liability is categorised is
             determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement financial
             assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety into only one of the three levels

             effective interest method

             the effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of
             allocating interest income over the relevant period

             the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts including all fees
             on points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate transaction cost and other
             premiums or discounts through the expected life of the financial asset or where appropriate a shorter
             period income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial
             assets designated as at fair value through profit or loss

             financial assets

             the group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below depending on the
             purpose for which the asset was acquired the group has not classified any of its financial assets as held
             to maturity

             financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported only when a legally enforceable
             right to setoff the amounts exists and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or to realise the asset
             and settle the liability simultaneously

             the groups accounting policy for each category is as follows

             fair value through profit or loss  heldfortrading

             financial assets classified as heldfortrading comprise the foreign forward exchange contracts which are
             not designated as hedges in terms of ias 39  financial instruments recognition and measurement

             loans and receivables

             these assets are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
             an active market they arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers eg trade
             receivables but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset

             they are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition
             or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less
             provision for impairment

             impairment allowances are recognised when there is objective evidence such as significant financial
             difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment that the group will be
             unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable the amount of such a provision being
             the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows
             associated with the impaired receivable for trade receivables which are reported net such provisions are
             recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in

             profit or loss on confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable the gross carrying value of
             the asset is written off against the associated provision

             loans to group companies

             these include loans to holding companies fellow subsidiaries subsidiaries joint ventures and associates
             and are recognised initially at fair value plus direct transaction costs subsequently these loans are measured
             at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any impairment loss recognised to reflect
             irrecoverable amounts

             on loans receivable an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that
             it is impaired the impairment is measured as the difference between the investments carrying amount and
             the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial
             recognition

             impairment losses are reversed in subsequent periods when an increase in the loans recoverable amount
             can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised subject to the
             restriction that the carrying amount of the loan at the date the impairment is reversed shall not exceed what
             the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised

             impairment of financial assets

             financial assets other than those at fair value through profit or loss are assessed for indicators of
             impairment at each end of the reporting period financial assets are impaired where there is objective
             evidence that as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial
             asset the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been impacted

             for financial assets measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method the following
             objective evidence is considered in determining when an impairment loss has been incurred

              significant financial difficulty of the debtor

              a breach of contract such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments and

              it is becoming probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation

             for certain categories of financial asset such as trade receivables assets that are assessed not to be
             impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis for financial assets
             carried at amortised cost the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying
             amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original
             effective interest rate the carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly
             for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through
             the use of an allowance account

             subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account
             changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss with the exception
             of availableforsale equity instruments if in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss
             decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was
             recognised the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss

             in respect of availableforsale equity securities impairment charges are included in profit or loss except to
             the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in other comprehensive income

             derecognition of financial assets

             the group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from
             the asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
             of the asset to another entity if the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards
             of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset the group recognises its retained interest in
             the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay if the group retains substantially all
             the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset the group continues to recognise the
             financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received

             classification as debt or equity

             debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the
             substance of the contractual arrangement

             equity instruments

             an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after
             deducting all of its liabilities equity instruments issued by the group comprising ordinary shares are
             recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs

             where the group or its subsidiaries purchase the companys equity share capital treasury shares the
             amount paid including any directly attributable incremental external costs net of income taxes is deducted
             from total shareholders equity as treasury shares when treasury shares are subsequently reissued or sold
             the amount received net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income
             tax effects is recognised as an increase in equity

             financial liabilities

             the group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories depending on the purpose for which
             the liability was acquired

             the groups accounting policy for each category is as follows

             fair value through profit or loss  heldfortrading

             financial liabilities classified as heldfortrading comprise the foreign forward exchange contracts which are
             not designated as hedges in terms of ias 39  financial instruments recognition and measurement

             other financial liabilities include the following items

             bank overdrafts borrowings and loans from group companies

             bank overdrafts borrowings and loans from group companies are initially measured at fair value and are
             subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method any difference between
             the proceeds net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over
             the term of the borrowings in accordance with the groups accounting policy for borrowing costs

             derecognition of financial liabilities

             the group derecognises financial liabilities when and only when the groups obligations are discharged
             cancelled or they expire

     18     impairment of assets other than goodwill

             the group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset may
             be impaired if any such indication exists the group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset

             if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired the recoverable amount is estimated for the
             individual asset if it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset the recoverable
             amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs is determined

             the recoverable amount of an asset or a cashgenerating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell
             and its value in use if the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount the carrying
             amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount that reduction is an impairment loss

             an impairment loss of assets carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation or amortisation is recognised
             immediately in profit or loss any impairment loss of a revalued asset is treated as a revaluation decrease

             an impairment loss is recognised for cashgenerating units if the recoverable amount of a unit is less than
             the carrying amount of collective units the impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of
             the assets of the unit on the following basis

              to the assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit

             an entity assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised
             in prior periods for assets may no longer exist or may have decreased if any such indication exists the
             recoverable amounts of those assets are estimated

             a reversal of an impairment loss of assets carried at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortisation
             other than goodwill is recognised immediately in profit and loss any reversal of an impairment loss of a
             revalued asset is treated as a revaluation increase in other comprehensive income

             where applicable direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
             inventories to their present location and condition cost is calculated using the weighted average method
             net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs
             to be incurred in marketing selling and distribution

     110 investment in subsidiaries

             in the companys separate financial statements investments in subsidiaries are accounted for as available
             forsale financial assets availableforsale financial assets are initially and subsequently measured at fair
             value through other comprehensive income

     111 intangible assets

             in the companys separate financial statements intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that the
             expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the cost of
             the asset can be measured reliably

             intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or
             give rise to other contractuallegal rights the amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using
             appropriate valuation techniques

             expenditure on research or on the research phase of an internal project is recognised as an expense when
             it is incurred

             an intangible asset arising from development or from the development phase of an internal project is
             recognised when

              it is technically feasible to complete the asset so that it will be available for use or sale

              there is an intention to complete and use or sell it

              there is an ability to use or sell it

              it will generate probable future economic benefits

              there are available technical financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or
               sell the asset

              the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably

             intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses

             the residual value amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets are reviewed
             annually

             intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life

             the significant intangibles recognised by the group its useful economic life and the method used to
             determine the cost of the intangible is as follows

     112 leases

             a lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
             ownership a lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and
             rewards incidental to ownership

             the land and buildings elements of property leases are considered separately for the purposes of lease
             classification

             finance leases

             finance leases are recognised as assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at amounts
             equal to the fair value of the leased property or if lower the present value of the minimum lease payments
             the corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease
             obligation

             the discount rate used in calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate
             implicit in the lease the lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and reduction of the
             outstanding liability the finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to achieve
             a constant rate on the remaining balance of the liability

             lessors shall recognise assets held under finance lease in their statement of financial position and present
             them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease

             operating leases

             operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term the
             difference between the amounts recognised as an expense and the contractual payments are recognised
             as an operating lease asset or liability any contingent rent is expensed in the period it is incurred

             lease income from operating leases shall be recognised in income on a straightline basis over the lease
             term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit
             derived from the leased asset is diminished

     113 property plant and equipment

             the cost of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised as an asset when

              it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and

              the cost of the item can be measured reliably

             property plant and equipment is initially recognised at cost costs include costs incurred initially to acquire
             an item of property plant and equipment and costs incurred subsequently to add to or replace a part if a
             replacement cost is recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property plant and equipment the
             carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised

             property plant and equipment excluding land is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and
             any impairment losses

             property plant and equipment excluding land is depreciated on the straightline basis at rates considered
             appropriate to reduce book values to estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives each part
             of an item of property plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the
             item shall be depreciated separately depreciation ceases when residual value equals more than the
             carrying value of the specific item of property plant and equipment

             the useful lives depreciation method and residual values of the individual items of property plant and
             equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and any revision to these are accounted for as a change in

             based on periodic valuations by a professional qualified valuer these revaluations are made with sufficient
             regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined
             using fair value at the end of the reporting period at least every five years changes in fair value are
             recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the revaluation reserve except to the
             extent that any decrease in value in excess of the credit balance on the revaluation reserve or reversal of
             such a transaction is recognised in profit or loss the increase is recognised in profit or loss to the extent
             that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss any
             decrease in an assets carrying amount as a result of a recalculation is recognised in profit or loss in the
             current period the decrease is debited directly to equity in the revaluation reserve to the extent of any
             credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset

             rehabilitation cost

             calculated at marketrelated discount rates and is recognised through the profit or loss

             an asset is recognised at the present value of the estimated rehabilitation obligation and is depreciated in
             accordance with the policies applicable to equivalent items of property plant and equipment

             the estimated obligation will be evaluated annually and any increases or decreases in the obligation will be
             recognised in profit or loss in the current year

             board of directors that makes strategic decisions all intersegment transactions are eliminated

     119 critical accounting estimates and assumptions

             in preparing the financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that
             affect the amounts represented in the financial statements and related disclosures use of available
             information and the application of judgement is inherent in the formation of estimates

             the following are the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty
             at the end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
             carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year

             provisions

             warranty provision

             a warranty provision is raised based on prior experience for defective products sold to be utilised by the
             returning of defective products by customers refer to note 16

             bad debts provision

             an estimate is made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts at yearend
             taking into account the difference between the carrying amount of assets and the present value of the
             estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition
             bad debts are recognised directly in profit and loss in the year in which they are identified refer to note 7

             loans and receivables

             the directors assess the loans and receivables for impairment at each end of the reporting period in
             determining whether an impairment loss should be recorded in profit or loss the directors make judgements
             as to whether there is observable data indicating a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows
             from the financial asset

             the impairment of loans and receivables is based on the amounts outstanding which management feels
             will not be collected or only partially collected where possible the impairment is estimated per debtor the
             estimate is based on a review of all outstanding amounts at yearend refer to note 7

             useful lives of items of property plant and equipment

             the directors estimate the useful lives of the classes of property plant and equipment taking into account
             the individual items of the class and the present condition along with any major capital expenditure that is
             budgeted in the near future

             the directors assess the methods used for property plant and equipment on an annual basis

             residual values of items of property plant and equipment

             the residual values of the individual items of property plant and equipment are reviewed annually by the
             directors the estimate is made after taking into account the condition of the item age and judgement
             relating to useful lives

              decommissioning and rehabilitation obligations

             the directors estimate annually any decommissioning and rehabilitation obligations which might exist at
             yearend the estimate is made after taking into account the extent of the obligation and any requirements
             relating to the obligation this obligation arose out of the mining and water chemical segment and the
             requirements in the mining license refer to note 16

             determination of fair values of intangibles acquired in business combination

             the fair values of product licences acquired in a business combination are based on the discounted
             estimated royalty payments that would have been avoided as a result of the product licences being owned
             the fair value of the other intangible assets is based on the discounted cash flows expected to be derived
             from the use and eventual sale of the asset

             taxation

             judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes due to the complexity of legislation
             where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such
             differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination
             is made

             the group recognises the net future tax benefit related to deferred tax assets to the extent that it is
             probable that the deductible temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future assessing the
             recoverability of deferred tax assets requires the group to make significant estimates related to expectations
             of future taxable income

             estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application
             of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction to the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ
             significantly from estimates the ability of the group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the
             end of the reporting period could be impacted

             estimated tax loss

             the group bases the tax expenses and deferred tax calculation on the estimated tax loss of the individual
             subsidiaries the estimated tax loss is calculated as per the south african revenue service stipulations
             indicated in the income tax act no 71 of 2008 once sars has assessed the company and agrees with
             the calculation of the estimated assessed loss sars grants the company an assessed loss should the
             situation occur that sars does not agree with the estimated assessed loss it will be rectified in the first tax
             expense calculation being performed with clear indication of such an event

             impairment testing

             the recoverable amounts of individual assets have been determined based on the higher of valueinuse
             calculations and fair values these calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions it is reasonably
             possible that the assumption may change which may then impact on estimates and may then require a
             material adjustment to the carrying value of assets

             the group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting
             policy stated in 14 for goodwill the recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units have been determined
             based on valueinuse calculations these calculations require the use of estimates

              1191 critical judgements in applying the entitys accounting policy

             no critical judgements apart from those involving estimations have been made in the process of applying
             the groups accounting policies that will have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial
             statement

     120 treasury shares

             where the company or its subsidiaries purchase the companys equity share capital the shares are treated

             transactions entered into by group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic
             environment in which they operate their functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when
             the transactions occur foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at
             the reporting date exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and
             liabilities are recognised immediately in profit or loss except for foreign currency borrowings qualifying as a
             hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation in which exchange differences are recognised in other
             comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve along with the exchange
             differences arising on the translation of foreign operations

     122 taxation

             tax expenses

             current and deferred taxes are recognised as income or an expense and included in profit or loss for the
             period except to the extent that the tax arises from

              a transaction or event which is recognised in the same or a different period directly in equity or

              a business combination

             current tax and deferred taxes are charged or credited directly to equity if the tax relates to items that are
             credited or charged in the same or a different period directly to equity

             current tax assets and liabilities

             current tax for current and prior periods is to the extent unpaid recognised as a liability if the amount
             already paid in respect of current and prior periods exceeds the amount due for those periods the excess
             is recognised as an asset

             current tax liabilitiesassets for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be
             paid torecovered from the tax authorities using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or
             substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period

             deferred taxation asset and liabilities

             deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the
             consolidated statement of financial position differs from its tax base except for differences arising on

              the initial recognition of goodwill

              the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at
               the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit and

              investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the group is able to control the timing of
               the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable
               future

             recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will
             be available against which the differences can be utilised

             the amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
             enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilitiesassets are
             settledrecovered

             deferred tax is charged or credited in profit or loss except when it relates to items charged or credited

     total property held by the group at 30 june 2013 amounted to r275 million 2012 r292 million comprising
     the amounts analysed above

     a mortgage bond of r10 million over property held in the name of new heights 390 pty ltd was registered as
     security in favour of sasol chemical industries as security for group borrowings

     the directors are of the opinion that the property is stated at fair market value and not impaired

     during the year anton smit  associated valuers an independent third party performed a revaluation on the
     group property based on discounted future cash flows marketrelated rentals and a capitalisation rate of 12

     the directors are of the opinion that the fair market value equals the estimated residual value and thus no
     depreciation is recognised

     at group level the majority of investment property is owneroccupied the portion of the property that generates
     rental income as per note 20 is regarded as insignificant resulting in all investment property being classified as
     property and not split between property and investment property

     had the property not been revalued the carrying amounts would equal the cost as disclosed above

     the value of the property has been considered at the yearend and no change was deemed necessary

     there are no restrictions on the distribution of the revaluation surplus and the company may declare a dividend
     out of profits or reserves realised or unrealised whether revenue or capital in nature

     land which is included in the above property has an indefinite estimated average useful life and is not depreciated

     the recoverable amount of a cashgenerating unit is determined based on valueinuse calculations these
     calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by management over
     a fiveyear period key assumptions applied in valueinuse calculations of the cashgenerating units revenue
     gross margin and cost forecasts are based on historical performance or where not appropriate managements
     views and estimates
     the discount rate used in the cash flow models is 20 this rate reflects the current market assessments of the
     timevalue of money and specific risks of the cashgenerating unit the discount rate is arrived at after taking into
     account the following factors
      the level of risk of the cashgenerating unit and
      the opportunity cost of capital
     the growth rates used by management in forecasting future cash flows are based on the historic experience of
     management and the economic environment in which the cashgenerating unit operates and are as follows
      rolfes resins  a compound growth rate of 15 per annum
      rolfes silica  a compound growth rate of 15 per annum
      rolfes dispersion  a compound growth rate of 10 per annum
      rolfes chemicals  a compound growth rate of 15 per annum
      amazon  a compound growth rate of 20 per annum
      agchem  a compound growth rate of 10 per annum
      tetralon  a compound growth rate of 15 per annum
      anticor  a compound growth rate of 15 per annum and
      pwm a compound growth rate of 15 per annum

     rolfes resins rolfes silica rolfes chemicals amazon agchem tetralon anticor and pwm recoverable
     amounts are based would not cause any of the individual carrying amounts to exceed its recoverable amount

           in determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the group considers any change in the credit quality
           of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date the concentration
           of credit risk is limited due to a large and unrelated customer base accordingly the directors believe that
           there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts

      no finance charges were recognised in 2012 on the rehabilitation provision since management was of the
      opinion that the provision is fairly stated at 30 june 2012

      on closure of the mining operations when rehabilitation of the site needs to be actioned there will be an
      expected outflow of economic benefits although the expected timing and amount of the outflows are uncertain
      at this stage

      details regarding the provisions are indicated in the accounting policies note 1

31 group risk continued
       the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their carrying values

       fair value of financial instruments
       the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows

        the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on
         active liquid markets is determined with reference to quoted market prices

        the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments is determined
         in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices
         from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments and

        the fair value of shortterm receivables and shortterm payables approximates their carrying amount

       at the reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk for loans and receivables the carrying
       amount of financial assets as reflected above represents the groups maximum exposure to credit risk

       financial risk management objectives
       the groups financial department provides services to the business coordinates access to domestic and
       international financial markets monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the group
       these risks include market risk including currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk credit risk liquidity risk
       and cash flow interest rate risk

       the group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to economically
       hedge these risk exposures

       compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed on a continuous basis the group does not enter into
       or trade financial instruments including derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes

       there has been no change to the groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and
       measures the risk

       market risk
       the groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
       interest rates the group enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency
       risk including

        forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the import of goods from
         international suppliers

       foreign currency risk management
       the group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies hence exposures to exchange
       rate fluctuations arise exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising
       forward foreign exchange contracts

      the group trades in europe asia and africa in pound euros us dollars and kwacha in zambia it is group
      policy that these transactions are hedged locally by entering into foreign exchange contracts as set out below
      the group reduced its currency risk by negotiating favourable payment terms with foreign suppliers and by
      actively managing its banking facilities for foreign debt repayments
      it is the policy of the group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency
      payments and receipts within 50 to 60 of the exposure generated the group also enters into forward
      contracts up to two months within 40 to 50 of the exposure generated basis adjustments are made to the
      carrying amounts of nonfinancial hedged items when the anticipated sale or purchase transaction takes place
      the group places orders to purchase raw materials from international suppliers with relevant forward foreign
      exchange contracts evaluated as above for terms not exceeding three months to hedge the exchange rate risk
      arising from these anticipated future purchases
      foreign currency sensitivity analysis
      the group is mainly exposed to currency in euro and us dollars
      the following table details the groups sensitivity to a 10 increase and decrease against the relevant foreign
      currencies the sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currencydenominated monetary items and
      adjusts their translation at the periodend for a 10 change in foreign currency rates the sensitivity analysis
      includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the
      loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower
      a positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the currency strengthens 10
      against the relevant currency for a 10 weakening of the currency against the relevant currency there would
      be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity and the balances below would be negative
      the foreign currency sensitivity analysis is consistent with those methods and assumptions used in the prior year

notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

31 group risk continued
       interest rate risk
       the group limits its longterm interestbearing liabilities as far as possible to limit the exposure to interest rate
       risk the group has made arrangements with its bankers to limit the exposure to interest rate risk but this does
       not eliminate the risk since the groups interest rate is linked to prime

       the company limits its interest rate risk by carefully monitoring its cash requirements to limit unnecessary
       overdraft facilities resulting in unnecessary interest expenses

       the group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk as entities in the group borrow funds at floating
       interest rates

       interest rate sensitivity analysis
       the sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives
       and nonderivative instruments at the end of the reporting period for floating rate liabilities the analysis is
       prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the
       whole year

       a 50 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management
       personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates

       if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant the groups profit for
       the year ended 30 june 2013 would decrease by r0057 million 2012 r0045 million

       this is mainly attributable to the groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings

       for a 50 basis point strengthening in the interest rate there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit
       and other equity

       credit risk
       financial assets potentially subject to group concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables
       ie credit sales which was r1668 million 2012 r1121 million

       it is group policy to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering into contracts such credit ratings
       take into account local business practices are factored into a credit risk profile the group uses credit references
       credit history bank codes and credit rating information to determine the credit rating of its new applicants the
       credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the fact that the customer base is spread over a
       wide variety of small and large receivables the group does not enter into complex derivatives to manage credit
       risk the group insures trading internationally through credit guarantee insurance company cgic

       credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss
       to the group the group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining
       sufficient collateral where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults this
       information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and if not available the group uses
       other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers collateral
       held by the group consist of sureties signed by certain customers

       trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical
       areas ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable

31 group risk continued
      liquidity risk
      the group has minimised its liquidity risk by ensuring it has adequate banking facilities and reserve borrowing
      capacity with highquality financial institutions or related companies

      the liquidity risk of the group is managed centrally by the chief executive officer and group financial director
      the budgets are set and agreed by the board annually in advance enabling the groups cash requirements to
      be suitably anticipated where facilities for group need to be increased approval is sought in accordance with
      authority limits set by the board

      the group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves banking facilities and reserve borrowing
      facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of
      financial assets and liabilities included in note 18 is a listing of additional undrawn facilities that the group has
      at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk

      the group has access to financing facilities the total unused amount which is r696 million 2012 r792 million
      at the end of the reporting period the group expects to meet its other obligations from operating cash flows
      and proceeds of maturing financial assets

                                                                                                            group

34 subsidiaries acquired continued
       primary reason for business combination continued
       to gain entry into the highly attractive agricultural chemicals sector and to add a total new range of chemical
       products to the existing large product basket of the rolfes group

       goodwill arising on acquisition
       goodwill in the business combinations arose because the cost of combination included a control premium paid
       to acquire 70 of amazon colours pty ltd amazon and agchem holdings pty ltd agchem in addition
       the consideration paid for the combination effectively included amounts in relation to the benefit of expected
       synergies revenue growth future market development and the assembled workforce of both companies these
       benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill as the future economic benefit arising from them cannot be
       measured reliably no amount of goodwill is expected to be deducted for taxation purposes

       the group also acquired the customer lists and customer relationships as part of the acquisitions these assets
       could not be reliably measured and separately recognised from goodwill because they are not capable of being
       separated from the group and sold transferred rented or exchanged either individually or together with any
       related contracts

       impact of acquisition on the results of the group
       included in the net profit for the year is r14 million attributable to the additional business generated by amazon
       and r158 million by the agchem business

      goodwill arising on acquisition
      goodwill in the business combinations arose because the cost of combination included a control premium
      paid to acquire 70 of tetralon chemical consultancy pty ltd tetralon and 704 of rolfes pwm pty ltd
      pwm and rolfes water chemicals pty ltd anticor in addition the consideration paid for the combination
      effectively included amounts in relation to the benefit of expected synergies revenue growth future market
      development and the assembled workforce of both companies these benefits are not recognised separately
      from goodwill as the future economic benefit arising from them cannot be measured reliably no amount of
      goodwill is expected to be deducted for taxation purposes

      the group also acquired the customer lists and customer relationships as part of the acquisitions these assets
      could not be reliably measured and separately recognised from goodwill because they are not capable of being
      separated from the group and sold transferred rented or exchanged either individually or together with any
      related contracts

      other nonreportable segments include the letting of property plant and equipment

      geographical segments
      the group primarily operates in south africa and the five geographical segments that could be identified would
      have been johannesburg pretoria durban cape town and brits districts but these geographical segments
      will not be identified due to the proximity of most of the districts and the similarity of economic and political
      conditions

      cape town and durban will not be identified geographical segments due to their insignificant contributions

      all intergroup management fees were eliminated in the separate segments to ensure more accurate
      representation to the stakeholders regarding the various business segments in the current and prior year
      represented

      in the prior year there were four segments identified and during the current year management combined the
      colour chemicals and industrial chemicals divisions as they are of the opinion that the combination is a better
      presentation to the stakeholders
