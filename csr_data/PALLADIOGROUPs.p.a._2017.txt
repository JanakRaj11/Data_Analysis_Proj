        annex 4  life cycle assessment lca


        lca assess in a systematic way the environmental aspects and impacts of a system or multiple production systems from the extraction
        of raw materials and resources to their final disposal in accordance with the objectives and the scope defined
        the study of lca was performed on each of the groups plants
        the following environmental aspects were identified and taken into account
        1     greenhouse gas emissions due to the transportation of raw materials products and waste indirect emissions
        2 greenhouse gas emissions due to the processing of raw materials getting into to the production cycle indirect emissions
        3     greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of natural gas in the plants direct and controllable emissions
        4 greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity needed in the plants direct and controllable emissions
        5 water consumption
        6 waste and scrap generated from raw materials paper cardboard and byproducts this aspect albeit indirectly impacts the
              consumption of raw materials
        7 production of liquid waste

        life cycle inventory lci
        at this stage was carried out data collection relating to the three years in question for each factory included within the system all data
        whether they are measured calculated or estimated were used to quantify the elements input to the limits chosen for reporting

        greenhouse gas emissions from the transport of raw materials products and waste
        the data used included

        dueville and thiene
        list of incoming trips for the procurement of paper and cardboard as raw materials and outgoing trips from the plant in vršac 
        list of incoming trips for the procurement of paper and cardboard as raw materials and outgoing trips from the plant in tullamore

        greenhouse gas emissions from the processing of incoming materials paper cardboard and their derivatives
        we used the last three years data containing the quantities of raw materials entering in each plant in detail the following incoming
        materials were identified
                  cardboard for folding cartons
                  paper for information leaflets
                  selfadhesive labels for stickers

        greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption of natural gas for premises heating
        for each plant we used the natural gas consumption invoices for the last three years

        greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption of electricity
        we used data on energy consumption of each plant invoices for the last three years

        water consumption
        we used data on water consumption invoices for the last three years

        production of waste and scraps from the raw material paper cardboard and derivatives
        we used the last three years data of the quantities of raw material paper cardboard and derivatives coming into the plants and the
        production of waste and scraps of paper and cardboard products in each factorymud po

        production of liquid waste
        we used the quantities of liquid waste produced at each plant in the last three years annual declaration of production waste eg mud
        for the italian plants
        the following types of waste were taken into consideration
                    cer 08 01 20 water suspensions containing paint or varnish
                    cer 08 03 13 waste ink
                    cer 08 03 14 ink sludge containing dangerous substances
                    cer 09 01 01 water based developer and activator solutions
                    cer 14 06 03 other solvents and solvent mixtures
                    cer 16 10 02 aqueous liquid waste

annex 5  life cycle impact assessment lcia


the results emerged from the inventory cycle life have been correlated with specific environmental categories through the use of
indicators of impact category which represent in a quantifiable way the category concerned after the impact categories and the related
indicators have been selected the lci results have been converted using the characterisation factors obtaining the results of the
different category indicators
the sum of the contributions relating to each category allows obtaining the profile lcia which has the purpose of providing information
regarding the environmental factors associated with the input and output flows of the system chosen

impact categories selection
the environmental categories proposed by the society of environmental toxicology and chemistry setac europe in its working group
on lcia are listed below

          extraction of abiotic resources these type of resources includes three different types of natural elements
            o    nonrenewable resources fossil fuels or minerals
            o    resources groundwater sand and gravel
            o    renewable resources surface water solar energy wind energy etc

          extraction of biotic resources including biomass harvested in sustainable modes as well as in unsustainable ways
           deforestation
          land use reduction of plant and animal species present in a given territory
          global warming increase in temperature in the lower atmosphere as a result of the presence of greenhouse gases that trap
           infrared radiation
          depletion of ozone layer a consequent increase in the incidence of ultraviolet rays which are harmful to humans and to all
           ecosystems in general
          ecotoxicity impacts on species and ecosystems due to direct emissions or subsequent degradation of the products
          human toxicity due to the presence of chemical or biological substances emitted into the environment
          photochemical pollution caused by the formation of tropospheric ozone following the reactions of volatile organic
           components in the presence of light and nox
          acidification release of protons h  in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems
          eutrophication due to an excess of nitrates phosphates organic substances and nutrients

classification
now that the effects and potential harm of emissions on human health and the environment are known the results from the inventory
phase of the life cycle can be associated with one or more categories of impact

characterisation
in this phase we obtain the quantification of the impact generated the data in the inventory are transformed into indicators of numeric
character thus determining the relative contribution of each individual substance or resource used

application to the palladio group
referring to the results from the inventory phase of the life cycle the relevant impact categories are listed below
          emissions of greenhouse gases have been linked to the category global warming
          water consumption has been associated with the category extraction of abiotic resources
          the production of waste and therefore even indirectly the consumption of paper and cardboard has been associated with the
           category extraction of biotic resources
          the production of liquid waste has been associated with the category ecotoxicity


total global warming and comparison between the groups plants
      following the classification the greenhouse gas emissions have been associated with this category of impact resulting from
          transportation of raw materials products and waste
          processing of the incoming paper material
          consumption of natural gas
          consumption of electric power
          consumption of heating oil
