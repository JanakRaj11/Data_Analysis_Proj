          reducing co2 emissions from our products in use by customers as well as in production
while our products build social infrastructure improving the lives of people they also generate an environmental impact throughout
their lifecycle ranging from manufacturing and use to disassembly for recycling or disposal we regard our dantotsu products and
services designed to help customers improve their environmental performance as strategies of differentiation we are also cutting
down consumption of electricity at our production plants dynamically improving productivity and leading to the reinforcement of our
competitiveness

in terms of co2 emissions throughout the life cycle of construction equipment about 90 is emitted during use by customers
accordingly it is very clear and evident that we must focus our efforts on this stage in addition to providing products with a high
environmental performance such as hybrid models we are taking an approach to the customers ways of using our machines by
proposing fuel economy operations based on analyses of komtrax komatsu machine tracking system data as a result we are
working to reduce co2 emissions per work load by 251 as the longrange target

with respect to the reduction of co2 emissions in manufacturing we have conventionally set up longrange targets we are working for
a reduction of 572 in japan and 323 overseas by continuing the power consumption reduction program and making other efforts

notes
     1 new equipment to be sold in 2025 as compared to new equipment sold in 2007
     2 the target figure in 2020 from 2000
     3 the target figure in 2020 from 2010


          promoting responses to diversity and a global management drive
in terms of corporate governance i am convinced that komatsu needs to become a company where a diverse range of employees can
demonstrate their talents to the fullest extent while fair and hightransparency management is a must of course

concerning diversity it is important to create workplaces where female employees can demonstrate their talents to the fullest extent
and we have set the target of increasing the ratio of female managers to 7 by april 2018 and 10 by april 2021 furthermore we
introduced the global officer system in april 2016 we have promoted the policy of assigning the posts of presidents of overseas
subsidiaries to local employees who have worked for komatsu over the years and who have a thorough understanding of the respective
local markets and business practices as a result many overseas subsidiaries are managed by them today in the global officer
system presidents of major overseas subsidiaries have been assigned as global officers and fourteen of them have been assigned as
executive officers of komatsu ltd so that they can participate in important management meetings of komatsu ltd i believe their
involvement in management of the komatsu group is very important to drive our globally consolidated management into the future



komatsu maintains the basic management policy of commitment to quality and reliability to maximize its corporate value komatsu
believes that its corporate value is the total sum of trust given to it by society and all its stakeholders

under this policy as we are looking into march 2019 the target year of the midrange management plan 2021 our 100th anniversary
year and beyond we would like to make an innovative contribution to solving customers problems as well as social problems through
our business activities by becoming more acutely4aware ofkomatsu  csr report

requirements throughout the conduct of our business and we deepen our understanding of material issues through dialogues involving
stakeholders inside and outside the company thus we seek to earn the trust society has placed in us as we pursue sustainable

     personnel system that accurately reflects employee abilities and achievements
personnel systems in japan are typically based on the assumption that employees will work for a single company for many years
therefore when designing a system a company must keep in mind the degree to which continuous employment should be considered
komatsu believes that personnel systems emphasizing length of service do not necessarily reflect employees abilities and
achievements fairly instead komatsu has always strived to accurately evaluate the performance of employees as individuals
incorporating employees achievements and abilities into its personnel system as the basis for fair evaluations

                                      values are changing at an amazing speed this means you cannot respond to change by doing
              business with
              business      only certain
                       with only         people within

                                      before this    where diversity becomes necessary this is the same reason komatsu is proactively
                                                   is where

                                                from the
              since the

              bearing

              in order to do that particularly in the present transitional period we are holding training sessions for women who are one or
              two steps away from management level positions to help them think about their career plan being given work with some
              responsibility often leads people to experience a lot of personal growth and find joy in their work we are hoping that if
              women employees have such experiences before going through life events it will motivate them to continue pursuing their
              careers



              aside from this komatsu has continued with other initiatives for diversity such as actively promoting the òbusiness
              creation centeró bcc where persons with disabilities are employed as permanent staff to work at manufacturing sites and
              in the offices as well as promoting the rehiring of retired people to have them make good use of their cumulative
              experience

              in society there are people who have various characteristics and conditions that cannot be lumped together we are
              conscious that creating a work environment where the lgbt population can work comfortably is also an issue that must not
              be forgotten we will continue to work on diversity as a way of being both a ògood companyó and a òstrong companyó

       strengthening information security




komatsu is developing an information security structure for the entire group placing the information security committee at its center
as one sphere of this structure the company distributes an information security guidebook to all employees in conjunction with this it
provides education and awarenessraising activities based on the guidebook with the belief that raising individual employee
consciousness of information security is essential the company is developing a structure to protect information from being falsified
leaked or lost even in cases of negligence or outside intrusion in addition it is conducting information security audits to ensure that
these measures are working effectively and to detect and address any problems



       human right management issues
komatsu signed the united nations global compact in 2008 in an effort to apply its major principles for protecting human rights
komatsu with the help of external experts conducted a human rights risk assessment for all of its constructionmining equipment and
forestry machinery businesses worldwide in 2014 referring to the universal declaration of human rights and the un guiding
principles on business and human rights
the results showed that the degree of urgency for problems occurring is low while the degree of effect if a problem does occur is
moderate they also pointed to the need for komatsu to move beyond its current assessment efforts toward evaluating the activities of
partner companies such as parts suppliers and our network of distributors that provide products and services to our customers in light
of the results we intend to continue implementing the necessary measures

improvement are shared within the companies of the group which is set up for lateral dissemination of information
in north america europe and china there are midorikai organizations made up of komatsus major business partners
these chapters are making the most of the characteristics of their respective region in furthering their activities

support to member companies
komatsu supports midorikai member companies in a variety of ways and making effective use of the initiatives of each group while
promoting improvement activities support activities during fy2015 are described below

safety
as part of the effort to strengthen safety and health activities we are conducting safety patrols continually and sharing information on
labor accidents as well as lateral sharing of safety measures through the safety activities presentation meetings in order to support
each company in increasing their level of safety
as a part of each groups initiatives there is some friendly competition as they patrol each others companies within the group to
provide findings and look for areas of improvement as part of promoting such activities
in addition we opened safety training centers in each komatsu plant that our business partners can use so that their employees can
also experience simulated workplace hazards and be trained to anticipate dangerous situations




example of conducting safety patrols for each other activity involving friendly competition of patrolling each others company to point
out and make improvements based on findings

environment
we made certain certifications such as iso14001 and eco stage mandatory and as a result of our directing and supporting efforts to
obtain these certifications all 164 companies within the midorikai are now certified in our efforts to reduce electricity consumption we
set a target for reducing electricity consumption by at least 15 from 2010 levels we are also working to reduce the energy
consumption of 97 companies of our business partners focusing on implementing komatsus initiative as part of our production system
reforms to reduce electricity consumption by 50 across our business partners

personnel development
to develop young top management at our business partners we hold òmanagement salonsó as occasions for komatsu management
and young top management to exchange views with this approach we intend to develop òwinwinó relationships with our business

     management system
checking system for new business transactions and agreements
komatsu uses a check sheet before it starts doing business with a new supplier not only to confirm basic conditions related to quality
cost and delivery but also to verify their efforts in environmental protection and employee education
to conduct a business transaction in accordance with the csr procurement policy our basic agreement includes clauses pertaining to
environmental protection and compliance

risk management prepared for occurrence of natural disasters
komatsu is strengthening its risk management system for procurement since fy2012 we have conducted assessments in japan so
that we can quickly determine the status of partner companies in the event of a disaster such as an earthquake or tsunami and be able
to continue procurement activities without delay to minimize the effect on production we input the location and production content for
each of the over 20000 sites of all our partner companies to create a database for òvisualizationó and assessed the degree of risk in
addition to considering prevention measures for each partner company that have higher levels of risk the procurement staff will be able
to consider risks from this aspect when considering new agreements so that we can heighten the accuracy of the information
in the event of an emergency we will dispatch security maintenance personnel from our plant to our partner companiesñas we did
following the great east japan earthquakeñto help support speedy production recovery

funding for military groups we will immediately discontinue any use of conflict materials that we discover
