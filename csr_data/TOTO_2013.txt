     under the toto green challenge to dramatically accelerate the environmental activities that we have
     been conducting we are implementing initiatives in the three key spheres of products and services
     manufacturing and social contribution as well as human resources development which serves as the
     foundation of these spheres as part of setting milestones in the three key spheres we have devised the

     logistics innovation supporting the domestic housing
     equipment business
     the toto group has been fundamentally revising logistics flow since fiscal 2010 and has undertaken
     innovation activities to thoroughly reduce waste while incorporating improvement suggestions from
     worksites we have reduced workloads and substantially shortened lead times in the future these
     activities will support growth in the japanese housing equipment business by firmly meeting continually
     expanding demand for remodeling



     supply chain innovation able to meet                                                   logistics innovation results through
     market needs                                                                           two steps
     in the process of working to achieve the targets of toto                               the first step was transportation system innovation from
     vplan 2017 and toto green challenge the toto                                         the production plant to the delivery center andor terminal
     group is implementing companywide innovation activities                              previously products were transported from the kyushu
     one of these innovation activities supply chain innovation                           production plants to four logistics centers around japan
     encompasses fundamentally changing the flow of goods                                   including a center in chiba through a variety of routes
     from raw materials procurement through production and                                 some of which included main vendor terminals while other
     logistics to delivery of products to customers by speeding                           routes did not go through a logistics center but shipped
     up this flow we have succeeded in raising our cost                                    products directly to delivery company terminals
     competitiveness                                                                          complicated shipping routes also means more loading
        a major aim of the logistics innovation that is one                                 work therefore we worked to build the single pass
     aspect of supply chain innovation consists of the three                                logistics system to transport goods from production plants
     points of logistics cost improvements substantial                                     to logistics centers without going through intermediary
     shortening of logistics lead times and reduction of co2                               terminals the transportation method was also changed
     emissions through optimization of transportation routes                               from truck transport to ferry transport using large trailers
     the momentum for undertaking logistics innovation also                                 to establish a consolidated transportation system
     includes the background context of shifting demand from                                   the second step was fundamental reform of logistics
     new construction to remodeling and shifting needs from                                 centers where diversified products were stored together
     mass production to highmix lowvolume production with                                 in logistics centers products were typically delivered two
     shorter time to delivery compared to new construction                                days before shipment the outbound shipment process
     in remodeling the time it takes customers to decide on                                would take one and a half days from the afternoon of the
