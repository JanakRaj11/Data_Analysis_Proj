   welcome to the first of many reports that highlight the cleaning product industrys
   sustainability story

   the us cleaning products industry those who make the products and those who supply the
   ingredients and packaging

   this association established in 1926 and our members have engaged in social sustainability
   efforts long before that terminology came into being

   our founders created a cleanliness institute to teach the value of hygiene the institute
   published educational materials in cooperation with public and private organizations  including schools and
   health social and welfare agencies  to improve hygiene practices

   this outreach continues today using online and digital resources to reach new audiences looking for useful
   information on the beneficial use of hygiene and cleaning products examples of that outreach are highlighted
   in this report

   a number of companies within our industry have been at the forefront of sustainability reporting during the
   past decade many more are beginning to talk about how sustainability is an important part of their daily
   business activities

   as the us organization representing the cleaning product supply chain aci is beginning its reporting by
   showcasing how our industry is recording and reporting environmental metrics and contributing to human
   health environmental quality and wellbeing

   threequarters of our dues base on behalf of aci environmental resources management collected data
   targeting four specific endpoints co2greenhouse gasglobal warming emissions water usagesavings

   manufacturing as aci represents the formulators and ingredient suppliers of cleaning products

   the report also features snapshots of what a number of our member companies are accomplishing on the
   sustainability front throughout the year

   and quality of life aspects of their products for decades aci is taking its initial steps towards a thousand miles
   journey we want to publicly display our progress and outline where we have challenges to address

the data reported by individual companies 20 companies over
the course of the project representing approximately 73 of acis
dues base was compared with us production rates associated with
cleaning products for each company to produce a normalized value
which represents performance per unit of production ie gigajoules of
electricity consumed per metric tons of production

the data reflects cleaning productrelated production of companies
which formulate and produce the end products and companies that
provide ingredients used in cleaning product formulation

data was submitted by the following number of companies for the three
reporting years

  2009 18 member companies
  2008 20 member companies

enhancing our commitment
to a sustainable future



        fmc corporation a chemical company with a 126year history of innovation believes
        our future depends on operating sustainable businesses that contribute to our global
        environmental quality to us this means developing marketdriven products and
        technologies that protect our planets environment and reduce energy consumption while
        improving our own manufacturing operations to protect our employees and the local
        communities in which we operate

        we have reduced industrial wastes by 50 percent greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent
        and accident rates by 73 percent from our manufacturing sites worldwide since 2000
        in the united states we have reduced us environmental protection agencydesignated
        priority chemicals in releases and wastes by 65 percent and 93 percent respectively since
        2000 working with local communities and government agencies fmc has returned
        nonproductive brownfield sites back to active uses creating thousands of new jobs and
        alleviating environmental hazards

        in developing countries fmc is a source of both income and jobs by helping establish
        environmentally sustainable seaweed farms that supply our business we have contributed
        to the worlds food supply by creating products that actually reduce chemical inputs while
        increasing crop yields we also are reducing incidents of foodborne illness through our line
        of halogenfree disinfectants and sanitizers used to safeguard food products packaging and
        food processing facilities

        in addition to waste reduction sustainable farming and increased food safety measures our
        range of new green chemistries includes lithium used to power hybrid and electric cars
        and soda ash used in the production of solar panel glass we have commercialized new in
        situ remediation chemistry to quickly bring sites with contaminated soil back to sustainable
        use and reduce landfill burdens we are developing products and technologies that cost
        effectively remove critical air emissions such as nitrogen and sulfur oxides and mercury
        from fossil fuel sources as well as safer and more environmentally friendly chemistries
        to improve wastewater disinfection and oil and gas production our natural sustainable
        biopolymers are replacements for petroleum derivatives across a wide range of consumer
        packaged goods new applications of our specialty chemistries have promise for reducing
        energy consumption by extending the life of roads runways dams and bridges

        fmc is committed to technological innovation that reinvents the way we produce our
        traditional chemistries three of every four dollars we spend on research is for new
        sustainable applications such as the next generation of lithium power or making our
        operations greener such as converting waste methane to energy use we believe it is
        incumbent upon us to continually look for ways that we can sustainably manage our future
        safely steward our products and contribute to a greener globe

warwick chemicals




              at our manufacturing site in the uk we produce a product called taed that helps
              consumers save energy every time they wash their clothes adding just a few percent of
              taed to a laundry detergent means that consumers get excellent stain removal without
              the need to use hot water reducing the temperature at which clothes are washed is the
              most significant way the detergents industry can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions

              at warwick chemicals we are also committed to sustainability in the way that we
              manufacture our products we are careful in our use of raw materials recycling process
              liquors to extract as much product as we can when we are unable to extract any further
              useful product the small amount of solid waste left which has the same calorific value
              as coal is burnt on site to generate 10 of the sites steam requirement this saves both
              energy and the need to landfill chemical waste as a consequence of this in 2008 and 2009
              no hazardous chemical waste was sent from the site to landfill

              we have installed equipment throughout the site to reduce our energy requirements this
              includes installing flue gas economisers which improve the efficiency of boilers by 5 and
              reduce fuel use by 4 we have also installed gas flow systems that reduce fuel usage by
              the boilers by a further 4

              initiatives are already planned to improve chemical efficiency and reduce energy usage
              further
