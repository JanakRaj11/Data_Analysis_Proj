                                   dear shareholders
                                   the key markets addressed by burckhardt compression exhibited positive developments during
                                   the past year despite the many challenges the world economy was faced with order intake and
                                   sales were significantly higher in fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year with exceptionally
                                   high growth in the compressor systems cs business area incoming orders at the components
                                   services  support css business area fell short of expectations as forecasted during the
                                   reporting of halfyear results the operating profit margin for 2013 of 158 was in the lower third
                                   of the longterm target range of 15 to 20

                                   annual order intake exceeds half a billion for the first time orders received amounted to
                                   chf 5171 mn surpassing the record high from the previous year chf 4278 mn by a substantial
                                   209 228 at constant exchange rates 2013 marked the first time in the history of burckhardt
                                   compression that annual order intake passed the chf 500 mn mark this result was achieved
                                   thanks to the surge in business at compressor systems which reported a 417 increase in orders
                                   received from chf 2727 mn to chf 3863 mn the components services  support business
                                   area was unable to repeat its strong performance from the previous year its order intake of
                                   chf 1308 mn was 157 lower yoy chf 1551 mn mainly due to the absence of new contracts
                                   for major revampengineering projects

                                   strong sales growth thanks to compressor systems  lower margins fullyear sales of
                                   chf 4450 mn plus 213 at constant exchange rates plus 224 marked the highest fullyear
                                   sales figure burckhardt compression has ever achieved in its entire history as in the preceding
                                   two years sales were higher in the second half than in the first half due to the compressor sys

                                   business area increased slightly by 07 from chf 1510 mn to chf 1521 mn the substantial
                                   increase in sales is largely attributable to the compressor systems business plus 358 to
                                   chf 2929 mn gross profit of chf 1392 mn was 24 or chf 32 mn higher compared to the pre
                                   vious fiscal year this resulted in a gross profit margin of 313 371 in the previous year a shift
                                   in product mix and two larger compressor systems projects that closed with a negative margin
                                   prevented both the cs and css business areas from maintaining their high gross profit margins
                                   from the previous year operating profit of chf 702 mn was slightly less 43 than in the pre
                                   vious year mainly because of the corresponding slight increase in gross profit the operating
                                   profit margin therefore slipped to 158 200 in the previous year net income declined by 18

    gross profit of chf 1392 mn was 24 or chf 32 mn higher
compared to the previous fiscal year this resulted in a gross
profit margin of 313 371 in the previous year a shift in prod
uct mix prevented both the cs and css business areas from
maintaining their high gross profit margins from the previous
year the lower gross margins in the cs business were further
more influenced by two large compressor systems projects
which closed with a negative gross profit while the css business
contained some revampengineering projects which did not
match the same high gross margins as achieved in the prior year

in september 2013 burckhardt compression began using a
leased 4000 m2 warehouse in the vicinity of winterthur an
additional assembly hall for the winterthur site had to be found
to accommodate the high order intake in fiscal year 2013 all
hyper compressors will be assembled for the time being at this
warehouse in the future production capacity in winterthur

with topoftheline manufacturing equipment



research  development
development of a new size of labygi compressor
a new frame size for the labygi compressor which is pri
marily used for compressing natural gas in on and offshore
applications was developed during the past fiscal year this
gives customers an even broader range of operating possibili
ties this latest development allows us to cover the entire
spectrum of lng carrier sizes available today

successful field tests for stepless flow control system
during the year under review we continued to build our know
ledge of stepless flow control for reciprocating compressors in
an ongoing field test including in application areas involving
explosive gases the process control advantages and energy
savings versus conventional control systems were confirmed in
field tests these field tests and longterm testing will set the
stage for the subsequent market launch of this new product

recycling and waste disposal
we dispose of our waste in such a way that as much as possible
is recycled and as little as possible is wasted internal collec

the correct manner by implementing such measures most of
our waste can be recycled the rest is sent to the neighboring
waste incineration plant where district heating is generated for
warm water and room heating specialized companies are hired
to recycle certain materials eg metals in order to ensure the
materials are recycled in the appropriate and environmentally
friendliest manner waste management practices were further
improved friendliest manner in 2012 the disposal of packing
material and wood was significantly improved as a result the
total waste declined from 2011 to 2012 from 246 tonnes to 197
tonnes in the year under review the total amount of waste pro
portionally rose with the sales increase of 213 we aim to
keep the amount of waste at the current level despite the
higher output

measuring vibrations and compressor performance at a compression station for ethylene

compressor specialists from our sizing and service units measure vibrations and performance data at reciprocating compressor
installations  in the field at customer premises during final inspection and acceptance and in the event of any deviations while in
normal operation we analyze all measurements inhouse and initiate corrective action when necessary


reliability
testing facility

before our labyrinth piston compressors are delivered to customers around the world they are brought to our testing facility
for elaborate testing thorough inspection of the compressor interior ensures adherence to high standards of quality
and workmanship the long periods between service intervals are proof of the laby compressors durability and reliability

onboard reliquefaction systems for lpg carriers

burckhardt compression has produced laby compressors for reliquefaction systems on lgp carriers for more than 50 years
these compressors can be used with a wide variety of gases depending on whatever cargo a carrier is carrying a gastight
compressor housing prevents emissions from escaping into the environment in accordance with strict maritime safety standards

 income taxes burckhardt compression is obliged to pay
   income taxes in various countries and is therefore required to
   make significant assumptions in order to calculate its world
   wide tax provision in the case of a number of transactions
   and calculations the final tax liability cannot be ultimately
   determined during the normal course of business where the
   final tax liability arising from these transactions differs from
   the initial assumption this will affect current and deferred
   taxes in the period in which the tax liability is ultimately
   determined
