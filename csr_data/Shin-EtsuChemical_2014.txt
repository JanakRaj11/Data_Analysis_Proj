               management                    we are using cuttingedge technologies
                                             to create a recyclingoriented society


               many products are thrown away after use but the shinetsu group strives to use limited resources efficiently and engage
               in recycling achieving sustainable resource circulation
                   our group collaborates with customers and related industry groups using cuttingedge technologies to recover
               products extract resources and reuse them in our products not only do these initiatives make it possible to reduce the
               waste output of our customers and the group itself but they also contribute to resource and environmental conservation

               the entire group works as one on key initiatives such as environmental preservation prevention of major disasters
               such as explosions or fires and prevention of work accidents
