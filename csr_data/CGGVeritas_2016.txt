dear mr secretary general


our industry is experiencing a profound extended and in many ways unprecedented crisis as we navigate through these
difficult times we have not compromised on our social and environmental responsibilities and ambitions all our employees
and subcontractors have been mobilized to maintain good health  safety practices and to continue to operate in a
responsible manner towards the environment and the communities hosting our sites and operations our results in this regard
are compelling


in order to continue to weather an enduring industry crisis in 2015 we accelerated a farreaching strategic transformation plan
whose aim is to rebalance our portfolio of activities and make the company less sensitive to the cyclical nature of our industry
we have had to make some tough decisions including a significant reduction in the number of employees


our company values and our adherence to the united nations global compact become even more important in such times i
am proud to reaffirm our belief that sustainable development can only be achieved if collectively we deliver longterm value in
financial social environmental and ethical terms


we know that what cgg and its partners do today will have an impact far into the future we act to meet the energy needs of
society today while respecting the needs of future generations leaving only a proud memory wherever we work


most respectfully yours

5 information on the utilization of financial instruments

more than 74 in 2015 and 2014 of our turnover is denominated in us dollars and to a more limited extent in brazilian real canadian dollar
renminbiyuan and in the other western european currencies such as euro british pounds and norwegian kroner
most of our expenses in 2015 are paid in us dollars euro british pounds norwegian krone and renminbiyuan we attempt to match foreign
currency revenues and expenses in order to balance our net position of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies
nevertheless during the past five years such dollardenominated expenses have not equaled dollardenominated revenues principally due to
personnel costs payable in euros in france and europe
in order to improve the balance of our net position of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we maintain our financing
primarily in us dollars at december 31 2015 and 2014 our total outstanding debt denominated in us dollars was us1874 million and
us1571 million and respectively representing 66 and 57 of our total financial debt outstanding at such dates
in addition our policy generally is to hedge major currency cash exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts or other foreign exchange
currency hedging instruments these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss
as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had us5 million and us26 million respectively of notional amounts outstanding under us dollars
against euro forward exchange contracts

7 prospects

71         market environment

the growth of the oil services sector and therefore of the seismic sector slowed down significantly from the middle of the year 2013 because
of the major international oil companies cutting back on exploration projects and more broadly on exploration  production investment expenses
in order to generate greater cash flow in the short term and maintain the expected level of dividends for their shareholders this trend was
confirmed during the year 2014 with overall exploration  production expenses finally stabilising and seismic expenses falling by 10 during
the second part of 2014 the price of a barrel of oil fell sharply and swiftly following the decision of saudi arabia to maintain its world market
share and let supply and demand fix the fair market price thus in the space of seven months oil prices fell by 59 going from us115 per
barrel middle of june 2014 to us47 per barrel middle of january 2015 which led to oil companies drastically reducing their exploration 
production spending forecasts for 2015
in 2015 the average brent oil price settled at nearly us53 down by 45 from 2014 at this pricing level the international oil companies ioc
do not generate positive cash flow after payment of the dividend and exploration  production investment expenses even after having reduced
such expenses significantly by about 20 between 2014 and 2015 as far as the national oil companies noc are concerned the priority is
the management of the oil income and the rate of decline of their fields in this respect exploration  production investments in 2015 went down
by about 25 compared to 2014 with the middle east where such investments continued to increase by about 5 being the notable exception
finally for shale oil producers these investments went down significantly by about 35 compared to 2014 since some of the wells are no
longer profitable at the current average price of a barrel of oil in terms of production the supply of oil is still on the rise because the main
producers in the middle east are continuing to hold their position in terms of maintaining market shares and because in the united states the
production of shale oil has been a lot more resilient than expected only starting to reduce in the second half of 2015 in terms of demand for oil
this has turned out to be stronger than anticipated particularly in the united states europe or india encouraged by low prices the oil market
is however still unbalanced with supply outstripping demand by 15 to 2 mbd
for 2016 the fall in crude oil prices in the second half of 2015 has led to the oil companies predicting a further drop of 25 in exploration 
production investments this would be the first time since 198687 that these investments would experience two years of consecutive reduction
and the oil companies think that the price per barrel would need to return to between us60 and 70 per barrel to see such investments increase
again the exploration investment expenses which bolster the majority of the cgg groups activity are even more in decline with a ratio of
exploration expenses to exploration  production expenses at the lowest for 15 years  proof of the reluctance of the majority of oil companies
to invest in longterm projects as for the offshore activity segment many exploration or development projects have been frozen or stopped
since the cost price per future barrel extracted from an area of deep or ultradeep water is still often well above the current average price per
barrel which leads a lot of oil companies to give priority to other projects in fact this segment should see its investments still fall heavily in
2016
but this situation of underinvestment in oil exploration and particularly in offshore exploration is not sustainable over the longterm currently
the growth in production from conventional onshore deposits iran iraq etc and the productivity gains from nonconventional deposits shale
oil in the united states allow both the growth in worldwide demand and the natural depletion of deposits being operated to be addressed in
the mediumterm this continuous and rapid depletion of conventional onshore deposits will result in a renewal of producers seismic imaging
needs particularly in the middle east china or russia over the long term it will not be possible to satisfy the growth in worldwide demand
without the development of new offshore deposits which will only become profitable again after a significant reduction in the costs of oil services
resulting in particular from better collaboration between the service companies and the oil companies across all stages of a deposits operating
chain and the development of an integrated vision for the reservoir consequently these changes allow us to glimpse favourable longterm
growth prospects for geophysics and geosciences


72         a commercial strategy based on technology differentiation

the group will continue to focus its strategy on highend seismic equipment and services and on integrated solutions in the geology geophysics
and reservoir characterisation disciplines the aim is to develop solutions based on a crossdisciplinary approach integrating the most innovative
technologies of each area of the groups expertise whilst improving or adapting these technologies to its clients needs this is particularly the
case with the stagseis multiclient programme in the gulf of mexico or the bedias creek survey in respect of shale oil hydrocarbons in the
united states which combined the groups equipment acquisition subsurface imaging and geological expertise activities in addition to the
high quality of its services and technology for cgg attention to the sound management of health safety and environmental matters hse is
crucial to establish lasting relationships with its clients
cgg believes that its longterm differentiation will result from developing acquisition technologies using highend seismic equipment and
combined with sophisticated subsurface imaging this combination will significantly improve image quality and maintain reasonable product lead
times in line with its clients exploration and drilling decisionmaking process this technological differentiation will be enhanced upstream by
the groups geological consulting expertise and downstream by its reservoir characterisation software and services to provide its clients with
reliable static and dynamic reservoir modelling solutions to enable better assessment of known or future reserves and higher recovery rates in
producing fields
in general the groups clients are still focused very early on in the production cycle on the future positioning of the drilling wells and their
configuration this translates into a steady interest on the part of the oil and gas companies in the technological content of seismic data in
order to extract highly specific reservoir properties from it in advance of their investment decisionmaking process the groups clients want in
particular to predict stress fields and fractures to ensure the safety and accuracy of the well drilling and the extraction operations while optimising
their return on investment these requirements could strongly influence seismic processing and reservoir characterisation activities and thus
significantly increase the geoscience component of the seismic market

sercels innovative solutions
in terms of equipment sercel maintains a high level of research and development which is justified by the high technological content of seismic
equipment which includes numerous cuttingedge technologies such as wireless transmission high and lowfrequency transmission or
miniaturised electronic technologies and also optical or acoustic technologies
sercel launched several new products in 2014 and 2015 including

          the nomad 65 neo and nomad 90 neo vibrators that allow the generation of a wider range of seismic wave frequencies and are
           therefore the ideal source for broadband seismic land surveys

          geowave ii the first digital multilevel downhole array tool specifically designed to withstand high temperatures up to 400f205c
           and high pressures up to 25000 psi1725 bars and which allows for up to 120 levels to be deployed on a standard wireline

          quietseatm a passive acoustic monitoring system for detecting the presence of marine mammals during marine seismic surveys

          geotag the acoustic positioning solution of choice for seabed seismic acquisition allowing the accurate positioning of all types of
           cable obc or autonomous systems on seabeds or in transition zones for seismic surveys in depths up to 500 metres


developing and improving land and marine acquisition technologies
the group believes that the growth in demand for geophysical services will continue to be linked to new technologies the group predicts that
highend surveys such as highdefinition 3d broadseis broadband 3d 3d full azimuth and also 4d with time as the additional dimension
and multicomponent 3c or 4c surveys will play a key role in the future in exploration  production especially in the sea deposits sector with
respect to the land sector increased demand for ultrahigh density surveys of sensors should result in teams deploying more than one hundred
thousand channels appearing in the field in the next five years this trend should transform the entire land acquisition chain with developments
focusing on lowcost sensors more mechanised deployments and more automated data quality controls

improving imaging and developing integrated solutions for reservoir simulation
to anticipate the exponentially increasing in data acquired big data considerable research and development efforts will be necessary for
seismic data processing data storage and management and also investigating new parallel computer architectures which should enable such
data to be processed in a reasonable time frame whilst making energy savings the group believes that by continually improving its seismic
data processing software it will remain among the leading suppliers of highend land and marine seismic services its research and development
work will therefore continue to focus on improving imaging in complex zones to help exploration and production as a technology for characterising
and monitoring reservoirs the group will also continue to develop lithological prediction identification of rocky layers surrounding the
accumulation of hydrocarbons and reservoir characterisation and content applications in particular 3d prestack depth imaging subsalt depth
imaging broadband depth imaging multicomponent acquisition imaging and differential imaging unique to 4d surveys

73          outlook for group activities in 2016

commercial outlook
the groups seismic activity equipment acquisition and imaging is strongly correlated to the exploration activity and should therefore decline
over the year 2016 more generally the geosciences activity should also be on the decline since the oil companies should continue to lower
their expenses and reduce their investments which will result in an even more difficult market than the one currently faced for the entire oil
related sector it is in this environment that cgg recently launched a new stage in its transformation plan

industrial outlook
in 2016 the group will focus on the management of its transformation plan in particular the implementation of the changes announced in
november 2015 in general terms cgg will continue to develop and promote highend solutions upstream with its equipment offering then in
the acquisition field which is essential for maintaining a strong and global relationship with the main ordering parties and finally downstream
with the services linked to the use of geological and geophysical data it is because of the high level of expertise developed in each of its activities
and their integration within the same company that the group can forge both rd collaborations and partnerships with its clients who value its
technological expertise in all geoscience areas


equipment maintaining the groups market share through technology and a strong client base

the group feels that the seismic equipment market will remain at a low level overall particularly affected by a significant weakness in demand
for marine seismic equipment which should represent only approximately 35 of the equipment market 2016 because of the very sharp
reduction in industrial investments of the groups main clients and the withdrawal from service of numerous seismic vessels including those of
the group with respect to the land seismic equipment market the group thinks that it will continue to decrease in 2016 due to the cost cutting
programs launched by clients however the subsidiary sercel could be supported by growing sales of the 508xt its nextgeneration land
acquisition system whose quality and functionality were demonstrated in the field throughout 2015 in the mediumterm the land equipment
market should be spurred by the need for better imaging of conventional onshore reservoirs that are currently being operated particularly
intensively with the increase in volumes produced aiming to offset the drop in prices as best as possible in order to control their depletion
better
overall the geophysics market is characterised by ever increasing demand for new technologies both in land and marine to achieve high
resolution imaging the group predicts that this trend will continue in the coming years because of its strong reputation and past success
sercel should be able to maintain its leading position in the seismic equipment market capitalising on its installed base the implementation of
new technologies in its full product range and also its diversified geographical presence

contractual data acquisition retaining expertise and limiting exposure

in 2014 the marine seismic industry had to demonstrate discipline in view of the deteriorating conditions in the marine contract activity with
prices having dropped by more than 10 on average cgg announced its decision to reduce the size of its fleet from 18 to 13 3d highcapacity
vessels and this step was followed by the other principal players in that market by the end of 2014 the market contracted even more sharply
as a result of the drastic reduction in offshore exploration  production budgets by oil companies the utilisation rate for the fleets of all market
players also decreased significantly in the first half of 2015 against this background cgg ceased operating 2 3d vessels at the start of 2015
keeping no more than 11 in operation despite this adjustment and those of other players prices dropped to levels which had never been seen
in the past as since the second quarter of 2015 the revenue generated by a vessel is close to the cash cost for operating it
in such an environment cgg announced at the start of november 2015 an additional step in its transformation plan for the marine seismic
acquisition activity with its decision to withdraw 6 additional vessels from its fleet in order to operate no more than 5 3d highcapacity vessels
in fact the group noted that the contractual marine seismic acquisition activity should be depressed for a long time with very low price conditions
generating heavy losses this poor pricing is due to lower demand following the sharp reduction of exploration programs less appetite for frontier
exploration and a structural oversupply linked to a large number of good coldstacked vessels which can quickly come back at a low cost
furthermore in the event of an improvement in demand cggs competitors would be able to increase again their capacity quickly by bringing
back to the market cold stacked vessels thereby limiting the chances of a price recovery the group has therefore decided to drastically reduce
its exposure on the marine contract market and to reposition the size of its fleet towards its needs in the area of the production of multiclient
studies that are sufficiently prefunded at above 70 which means operating 5 3d vessels for the next 2 years the marine seismic acquisition
activity will therefore be mainly a technological tool for the acquisition of multiclient data
thus the worldwide 3d highcapacity seismic fleet which stood around 33 active vessels at the end of 2015 compared to 63 vessels at the end
of 2013 will continue to decrease in 2016 in the light of the announcements made by the different contractors
in land acquisition cgg continues with its development strategy in niche and technological markets focusing on differentiation and operational
excellence avoiding as much as possible the commoditised part of this market its strategy by mean of the ultraseis broadband solution is to
meet the increasing demand for highresolution land seismic acquisition or using a highend technology as is already the case in the middle
east and north africa cgg will continue to put longterm partnerships in place in key regions or markets as has been done in the middle east
with taqa and with seabed geosolutions bv joint venture owned 40 by cgg and 60 by fugro
in multiphysics acquisition the priority in 2016 will be to take advantage of the 2015 restructuring plan which reduced the cost base and also
to continue with the aircraft fleet rationalisation programme with the aim of reducing the number of different aircraft models to optimise their
management the group has also planned to further pursue the synergies of electromagnetic and gravimetric measurements with the seismic
data
finally with a reduced seismic fleet the revenue generated by the contractual data acquisition segment including both land and marine
acquisition should now represent in the future less than 15 of the cgg groups turnover


geology geophysics  reservoir developing an integrated geoscience activity

investments in the multiclient activity went down by more than half in 2015 compared to those in 2014 us713 million since the ibalt
programme launched in 2012 in the gulf of mexico and based on the stagseis technology was completed in midoctober 2014 it continues
to attract increased interest from major oil companies active in that region notably in advance of the many lease block auctions scheduled for
the 20152017 period and it should generate significant aftersales in upcoming years for 2016 investments are expected between us300
million and us350 million with a prefunding rate of over 70 spurred by the undiminished appetite of oil companies for good quality multi
client seismic data in zones that they know well brazil the north sea etc which can capitalize on their existing infrastructures and reduce the
marginal investment cost moreover cgg should benefit from interest in new prospecting zones such as the mexican part of the gulf of mexico
where the groups expertise is acknowledged
the group will now dedicate most of its seismic fleet utilisation to it ie 3 vessels out of 5 on average for the marine multiclient activity with
contractual seismic acquisition taking up the remainder thus the multiclient activity may continue to be an integrating factor for all of the
groups technologies equipment acquisition imaging and geoscience by creating products that will use the different areas of expertise
developed in each of its product lines and which will allow its clients to prepare for their exploration programs and developments in the related
basins as best as possible
the subsurface imaging activity was more resilient in 2015 than the equipment and contractual data acquisition activities driven by the
increasing complexity of the geologies to be imaged which requires sophisticated and highend algorithms an area in which the group has an
unequalled position in addition the oil companies wanting to obtain the best possible images to maximise their exploration efforts are asking
for more reprocessing of previous data in order to benefit at a lower cost from developments of new imaging algorithms despite that the
subsurface imaging market is following the global trend of reducing exploration  production spending by its clients as the drop in the number
of marine or land seismic acquisition projects directly results in a significant fall in the volumes of new data to be processed as for the software
sales and consulting activity this was also resilient in 2015 with a smaller decrease in turnover than that in the exploration  production
spending by its clients in fact the cost of these products and services for clients is well below the value that they bring particularly with regard
to the amounts of the exploration or production budgets overall the subsurface imaging and reservoir activity saw its turnover erode in 2015
a decrease of 20 compared to 2014 a trend that should continue in 2016
looking forward the group in this new format will get around 60 of its revenue generated by the geology geophysics  reservoir ggr
activity

financial outlook
in 2016 the group does not expect an improvement in the seismic and geoscience market compared to 2015 against this background the
groups priorities will be strict cash management cost reduction operational and commercial efficiency and dynamic debt management
industrial investments excluding capitalized development costs should be between us100 million and us125 million in 2016 multiclient
cash investments should be between us325 and us375 million in 2016 with a prefunding rate greater than 70 finally the group could
also sell nonstrategic assets in 2016 the income from which would be used for the general funding of its activities

cggs capacity to remain competitive on a depressed market while building toward the future is largely dependent on its capacity for permanent
technological innovation the group believes that the future of the seismic industry relies on seismic equipment and services with high
technological content with the market for products and services being subject to such downward pressure on prices the development of new
solutions  from initial design through to market launch  must make cost reduction the number one objective capitalizing on its integrated
approach cgg has the capacity to reduce the cost of new solutions at each step in the value chain
cgg is convinced that the seismic industry will put in place new solutions that will have an impact on exploration and production the major
areas of oil exploration  arctic offshore presalt layer structures at sea and mountain ranges or jungles on land  are hard to survey and
constitute sensitive and complex environments frontiers in production increasingly precise monitoring of reservoirs in terms of both recovery
maximizing oil recovery and the risks associated with production geohazards requires our industry to conduct more repeated seismic
surveys 4d and improve the accuracy of the data acquired in the shortest possible time lastly as the common denominator in all this reducing
the costs of new solutions is vital to the shortterm survival of all players in the industry
with its experience expertise and involvement in every aspect of the seismic industry cgg is ideally placed to design and implement new
solutions
to implement this vision cgg focuses its efforts on the entire explorationproduction chain including reservoir characterization development
of multicomponent seismic data processing techniques structural imaging and improved operational performance these efforts are focused
on improving geophysical target illumination during data acquisition while increasing efficiency and safety with more than 700 employees the
rd teams are spread around the world and cover a broad range of areas of expertise
cgg also has access to new technologies through strategic alliances with equipment manufacturers oil and gas companies universities and
by acquiring technologies under license

group expenditure on rd including capitalized development costs amounted to usd 1431 million in 2014 or 68 of revenue
in the difficult environment experienced by the seismic industry in 2015 and which will persist into 2016 cgg has only slightly reduced its rd
investments compared to 2014 thereby demonstrating its resiliency in technological innovation as well as its continuing desire to differentiate
itself from the competition with the high technological content of its different solutions
the broadseis  broadsource solution continues to be the seismic broad frequency content benchmark this combination provides an
acquisition system capable of obtaining up to six frequency content octave bands 25  200 hz which are key to creating subsurface images of
unparalleled resolution the most remarkable part of this acquisition system combined with specific processing algorithms is the restitution of
very low frequencies under 5 hz these very low frequencies provide essential information for both profiling deeper targets and characterizing
hydrocarbon reservoirs using seismic data the innovation and the expertise of cggs ggr segment once again received strong client praise
in 2015
this technological achievement has placed cgg in a class apart on the broad frequency content seismic market segment widening the gap
with its direct competitors and putting this market out of the reach of businesses with inferior rd capabilities
the stagseis multiclient acquisition campaigns make it possible to obtain very long distance up to 20 km seismic data with 360 azimuthal
distribution and very dense sampling stagseis data sold well in 2015 demonstrating that stagseis is a solution that is perfectly suited to
addressing imaging difficulties particularly in the gulf of mexico
stagseis success confirms cggs ability to develop unique and highlyinnovative acquisition designs to help meet the imaging challenges of
our customers with solutions tailored to their needs these innovations are possible thanks to cooperation between our acquisition experts our
imaging experts and equipment provided by sercel this type of approach makes it possible both to develop highvalueadded customized
solutions and to propose innovations optimizing the use of imaging resources combined with substantial reductions in the final cost of the
solution
other land or marine seismic acquisition systems using drones are currently being assessed by cgg and could be developed over the next few
years

building on emphaseis vibrator operation technology using a wide frequency band and on cggs experience with land acquisition systems
involving a large number of channels up to 600 million traces per km 2 the ultraseis program is now able to offer efficiently and economically
broadband technology 6 octaves for acquisition projects using a very large number of channels the capacity of these systems will continue
to grow today up to 200000 channels with the objective of reaching one million channels in five years time this development is greatly
supported by sercels new 508xt acquisition system given the huge volumes of data required for the seismic imaging of reservoirs in the middle
east these acquisitions with a very large number of channels are intended to provide solutions to nearsurface and noise problems by increasing
the density of the source  receiver pairs ultraseis is also based on an optimized operational model designed to provide major productivity
gains and its integrated character ensures that the image provided is optimal for the quantitative characterization of the reservoir
in depth imaging cgg has pursued its development efforts to provide more accurate seismic images acquired in zones of complex geology
the research and development programs relate to the secondgeneration migration algorithms reverse time migration and full waveform
inversion taking into account absorption phenomena in anisotropic environments these technologies operate high resolution seismic velocity
models critical for the production of highprecision images cgg is now a technology leader in this field also to be noted in 2015 is the significant
effort that has gone into optimizing the calculation time for key algorithms
cgg is also working on the combined processing of multiphysics and seismic data in order to exploit synergistically these two types of
measurement that are not sensitive to the same geological property variations as in 2014 cgg continued in 2015 to provide results of
exceptional quality and recognized by the industry and produced by a combination of seismic resistivity and gravity data to better characterize
the near subsurface
concerning equipment sercels need to maintain a high level of research and development is justified by the high technological content of its
seismic equipment for land and marine acquisition this intense rd activity has put sercel at the cutting edge of technology for wireless data
transmission the design and manufacture of sensors with low noise levels and the design of miniaturized electronics that withstand extreme
environmental conditions sercels research also applies to underwater acoustics the nautilus lateral and vertical streamer positioning
controller and seapronav integrated navigation system systems have reached industrial maturity and are now the industry standard used to
equip cggs fleet
in marine sercel deployed its first quietsea aquatic activity monitoring systems enabling passive detection of sea mammals during exploration
campaigns
in 2015 sercel continued to market its sentinel streamers including its latest product the multisensor ms sentinel which provides an acoustic
vector sensor composed of a group of accelerometers arranged around a hydrophone
sercel deployed its 508xl land acquisition system combined with new highly sensitive quietseis sensors on crews in the middle east deploying
a large number of traces with extremely high productivity
the 508xt is the epitome of what is done best in seismic data acquisition with a simultaneous recording capacity of one million channels this
system also includes new features facilitating increasingly complex land seismic exploration operations
the market launch of the geowave 2 system was initiated through its currently unrivalled temperature and pressure performance geowave 2
enables seismic acquisition in deep hightemperature boreholes

on the production side improvements in monitoring techniques both in acquisition equipment and seismic data processing serve to optimize
shallow reservoir production these also improve recovery rates and extend the life of fields through appropriate management in major oil
producing regions such as the north sea and the middle east these issues are of crucial importance for operators however they remain an
important avenue of study for developing seismic surveys as a core discipline in deep reservoir production where resolution and reliability need
to be improved
in the field of exploration rd seismic achievements help identify prospective fields that are increasingly difficult to detect and reduce the
associated drilling risks accordingly the success rate of exploration wells tends to increase even though the easy targets were drilled first the
contribution of new technologies justifies the regular reprocessing of previously acquired data and increasingly the acquisition of new seismic
data on surfaces that have already been surveyed in the past in this way technical progress directly affects the activity in particular multiclient
activity or the reprocessing of old data with new algorithms
finally as in most fields related to the seismic industry the concepts of cloud and big data will be increasingly integrated in the processing
of seismic data while the use of marine and land drones should change current and mediumterm operational models
anticipating the difficult market conditions in 2016 cgg will be redirecting parts of its rd efforts to the development and optimization of the
costs of its solutions so as to provide a sustainable response to the low price of the barrel in this context two major lines of development stand
out cost reduction to address the shortterm context and high valueadded technological differentiation in order to maintain technological
leadership
reducing and optimizing the costs of the solutions
           reducing and optimizing the cost of its solutions by capitalizing on its capacities as a mainstream player in geoscience as part of an
            integrated approach cgg will be looking to define the optimum qualityprice ratio across the entire geophysical value chain and
            thereby reduce costs while guaranteeing the necessary information for decisionmaking
           the mechanization and automation of land and marine acquisition is a second avenue of cost reduction on which cgg is acting this
            approach necessarily requires the redefinition of the existing operational models

technological leadership
           improving data quality including expanding the range of recorded frequencies high frequencies for better resolution and therefore
            better geological characterization of reservoirs low frequencies ensuring better penetration to detect increasingly deeper targets
           increasing the amount of data through greater density of acquisition and increased azimuthal coverage to explore the geological
            target from all possible angles

            the most accurate picture of the subsurface possible as well as its porosity and permeability and fluid content water and
            hydrocarbons
this quest for improved data will ultimately result in positioning seismic instruments ever closer to the reservoir
despite the unfavorable context in 2016 cgg will continue to invest in research and development in order to support the groups capacity for
innovation with regard to both geophysical services and equipment

dialogue with stakeholders is at the heart of cggs sustainable development approach acknowledging the interest and contribution of its
stakeholders in cggs sustainable development cgg listens to its stakeholders when validating its priority sustainable development issues
every three years cgg organizes an extensive consultation involving the management a panel of employees clients investors ngos and its
trade association in order to highlight the most critical sustainable development topics for the group these priority issues are set out in the plot
area of the following graph using a 03 scale of importance the xaxis plots the priorities perceived within cgg and the yaxis plots the
importance given to the issues by the external stakeholders and hence their expectations the graph below shows the results for the 2012

912     sustainable development governance
9121   promoting an ethical culture and conduct
cggs values and rigorous ethical standards are the foundations of development for the cgg group they require us to comply with laws and
regulations and the principles of our business code of conduct with regard to our clients shareholders employees and partners the business
code of conduct available in nine languages sets out the rules and expected behaviour to enable the group to conduct its business with
integrity
the cgg ethics committee publishes and communicates the business code of conduct ensuring that our standards are widely distributed
the ethics committee promotes ethics training throughout the group which is described in greater detail in section 93 employees of this
chapter
the ethics committee is notified of any difficulty in interpreting or applying the business code of conduct in addition to direct channels to
access the ethics committee a whistleblowing procedure with hotline has been implemented in 2009 employees are regularly reminded of
ways to access the ethics committee the ethics committee meets several times a year it reports to the chief executive officer and to the
audit committee of the board of directors
the number of referrals to the ethics committee in 2015 was comparable to that in 2014 the committee was mainly contacted
           on issues of conflicts of interest that led managers or employees to raise questions ahead of a decision that might cause a conflict
            or regarding a relationship between cgg and one of its stakeholders
           on issues concerning relationships between the employees and the company which were handled in conjunction with the human
            resources department
            by operational or functional departments to answer questions from cgg clients about the groups approach to ethics including our
            efforts to prevent corruption in activities
the level of referrals to the committee in particular requests for advice show that the efforts undertaken in terms of communication and training
are producing results


9122   anticorruption program
cggs sustainable development materiality study underlined the significant risk of corruption inherent to our sector of activity a strong
compliance program within the group is a major focus for the cgg management team and a demonstration of its commitment to sustain the
groups momentum in this area
cgg continues its corruption prevention actions for example through training activities described in greater detail in item 2333 and by
bolstering its rules and procedures especially in the contractual terms and management of its various partners and service providers
in 2015 the group appointed a compliance officer who is mainly in charge of implementing the corruption prevention program within the group
the compliance officer reports to the evp general secretary  group general counsel and is also a member and the secretary of the ethics
committee
a communications campaign was launched within the group in december 2015 linked to the un international anticorruption day aimed at
raising the awareness of employees to this issue in particular and more generally to the importance of ethics within the cgg group
cggs robust anticorruption program has been recognized since 2014 every year by anticorruption certifications issued by mazarsadit
these certifications are based on a framework validated by the french central service of corruption prevention a ministry of justice institution
and by a panel of international experts


9123   governance of sustainable development issues
responsibility for health safety and the environment hse and human capital development lies with management for this it draws on hse
and human resources professionals in each business line and in the support functions
the group executive management plays a vital role in defining the terms and conditions under which cgg can develop its business while
protecting its employees local communities and the environment cggs leadership in sustainable development is established at the highest
level through specific expectations on hse performance regular communication monitoring performance throughout the year and implementing
necessary changes following periodic formal reviews
the sustainable development committee assists management by defining the guidelines for the sustainable development program three
times a year this committee reports on the progress achieved to the corporate committee ccom and to the hse and sustainable
development committee of the board of directors regular reviews are also carried out by business lines the corporate committee and the
sustainable development committee to check that the system is operating correctly these make it possible to identify areas for improvement
and corrective measures to be applied and ensure that suitable resources are made available to achieve the expected results

92         health safety security and the environment

921      material issues for health safety security and the environment hse
cggs primary sustainable development priority consists of preventing workplace accidents and occupational diseases among employees and
subcontractors historically the groups main risk activities are road transport helicopter operations treefelling crossing lakes and rivers cgg
is also committed to providing a healthy work environment with no addictive substance in the workplace
the security of its employees is another absolute priority for cgg the group is exposed to threats of burglary assault piracy and terrorism
which it counters through a system based on prevention and dissuasion
cgg seismic acquisition operations cover wide land and marine areas sometimes our activities take us to areas almost devoid of human
intervention the acquisition can also occur within ecosystems that are already fragile consequently cgg strives to develop geophysical
methods and equipment that enable its clients to prevent or reduce their environmental footprint in particular cgg seeks to contribute to better
knowledge of the potential impact of its sound emissions on the marine environment so as to adapt the necessary protection measures


922      policies applied to health safety security and the environment hse issues
9221    policies and objectives
cggs hse program is based on the conviction that all accidents can be prevented
hse expectations are established by the chief executive officer and are included in hse health and wellbeing safety and environment
policies every employee can access these policies either via the internet or displays at the groups sites these policies are supported by
threeyear objectives set by the chief executive officer and incorporated in the careprotect program
group objectives defined by the management applying to the domains of health safety security and the environment target more specifically
the management commitment and visibility on hse topics risk management subcontractor management competence and training each
business line adopts these objectives and specifies them in annual programs so as to best respond to the issues characterising their activity
in this way every level of the organisation is clearly informed of the expected results and called on to help achieve them group objectives also
serve as a base for personal objectives for the management team


9222    the operational management system for health safety and the environment hseoms
cggs structured approach to health safety and the environment is based on an operating management system for health safety and the
environment hseoms this has recently been extensively reviewed to comply with the latest international oil and gas producers iogp
guidelines for the development and application of health safety and environment hse management systems which have become a de
facto standard in the industry the hseoms applies to all of the groups activities in the domains of health safety security social responsibility
and the protection of the environment in all our sites and projects its scope extends to our permanent staff seasonal employees and
subcontractors operating within our prevailing influence the social responsibility domain will be described more specifically in item 4 of this
chapter
risk management is central to the operational management system for health safety and the environment hseoms the group maintains
a structured approach aimed at identifying assessing and controlling risks based on a common groupwide methodology and model for risk
management risks are assessed for each project or permanent installation they incorporate incident history drawn from the groups database
and the database shared with the international association of geophysical contractors iagc which covers several decades of incidents
through systematic risk assessments and in particular the targeted identification of highrisk activities we determine the necessary controls to
manage safety risks these controls include procedures work instructions specific risk management training site meetings and daily onthe
ground hse inspections supplemented by crossdepartment inspections the crossdepartment inspections are carried out by a person external
to the inspected entity drills carried out periodically at the installation and project level mean that the effectiveness of the emergency response
plans can also be checked at the site and project level line management carries out its own inspections and observations a robust audit
program ensures that the groups hse policies and key processes are implemented and complied with in all our activities the environment of
controls and monitoring is coupled with a culture of individual responsibility
individual risk awareness and personal responsibility are essential elements of our operating management system for health safety and the
environment hseoms the groups behavioural safety program entitled rules to live by and things we all must know is well rooted
across the organization since 2011 this program focused on the groups key safety risks is deployed across all activities and in several
languages and these rules are supported by visible posters at the workplace and clear instructions
the proper management of risks related to health safety security and the environment requires transparent reporting and rapid effective
communication comprehensive notification of all incidents nearmisses and hazards is crucial to obtaining good results our prism system
has been developed inhouse for this purpose prism is a software system that allows hse quality and social responsibility files to be shared
by all cgg sites and operational units it also allows to produce reports check performance assess and manage risk and action points all
cgg employees can access prism incidents are assessed according to their actual and potential severity and a subscription system allows
the appropriate management level to be notified immediately including the highest level management for highpotential incidents
the final element in our management system consists in management reviews conducted within business lines executive committee and
board hse and sustainable development committee these reviews ensure the systems proper operation identification of improvement areas
and corrective measures and make sure that suitable resources are in place

 health
 cgg implements occupational health programs aimed at maintaining quality of life at work through fitness for work programs and the
 prevention of occupational diseases the management of health risks and impacts is systematically adapted to the local environment it
 therefore takes into account the issues specific to very isolated areas and adapts the means of protection rescue and assistance for the
 staff exposed especially in the case of land geophysical projects thus in 2015 means for preventing malaria were bolstered in angola
 through an update of a procedure to improve in particular the information posters elearning in algeria the medical evacuation and
 repatriation plans were adjusted because of the sites extreme isolation targeting the reinforcement of aircraft means
  safety
 our risk analyses and prevention programs are directed first and foremost at highrisk activities for example road transport and offshore
 crew helicopter transfers this year we bolstered these risk management and prevention programs through the development of elearning
 training modules accessible to everyone and by producing a large number of posters and stickers covering all risk situations we have also
 introduced usafe a new educational tool to grasp more practically the risks at the workplace
 security
 cgg has implemented a security intelligence and monitoring system to identify and assess threats in areas prone to maritime piracy and
 potentially unstable areas onshore projects in areas at risk are reviewed at the highest level supported by assessments from security
 experts local security plans linked to projects are produced and implemented before operations start all staff also receive security
 information concerning their travel destinations
 environment
 cgg strives to avoid or minimize the environmental footprint of its operations historically cggs largest footprint concerned land acquisition
 activities in particular from treefelling linked to seismic line opening changes in seismic acquisition technology and equipment developed
 by our equipment business line in both sources and receivers have significantly reduced this footprint cgg implements environmental
 plans in all its business lines these plans are aimed at eliminating or reducing the impact on the soil water fauna flora and the atmosphere
 assessing the actual impact of activities remains challenging in one area because of incomplete scientific knowledge the effect of sound
 emissions from seismic acoustic sources on marine life this is why cgg promotes research in this domain and has for over fifteen years
 implemented risk prevention and mitigation measures on vessels marine mammal observer teams ensure compliance with applicable
 regulations stipulated by the country in which we are operating where no regulations have been issued cgg applies the risk mitigation
 measures recommended by the iagc


9223    promoting hse excellence
for many years acquisition projects implemented internal recognition measures rewarding proactivity with regard to hse the quality and
quantity of notifications of dangers and nearmisses reported at the project level are therefore generally linked to a system of material rewards
and formal recognition by the local management
at group level since 2014 cgg has also organised an annual competition above  beyondcareprotect the prizes reward cgg teams that
have achieved hse or sustainable development excellence through technological development innovative behavioural practices or the results
of an original initiative in 2015 the jury rewarded three excellence projects the first recognized health and fitness voluntary actions implemented
in rio houston and singapore promoting original and effective initiatives to improve the health and physical fitness of employees the second
awarded to hse training developers recognised the significant increase in quality acquired by the inhouse hse training courses thanks to the
adoption of new learning formats described in the results in terms of skills and training below the third rewarded quietsea the new passive
acoustic monitoring system integrated with the seismic streamers described in the environmental results below a special prize was also
awarded to the most deserving subcontractor and jointventure partner
cgg also continued to play an active role on the hse committee of the international association of geophysical contractors iagc cgg
participated actively in a number of workgroups organised by international oil and gas producers iogp these committees facilitate the
sharing of lessons learned from the management of major nearmisses or accidents the dissemination of best practices and reviews and
improvements to hse standards in the exploration  production industry

the frequency of hse incidents with high potential severity potentially fatal incidents including nearmisses which is tracked worldwide has
decreased
in 2015 as in 2014 cgg noted improved compliance with rules to live by and things we all must know shown by a decrease in the
frequency of breaches of these principles this improvement was more visible in the marine business line than in the land business line where
crews are renewed when they change locations
cgg has maintained a high focus on its vehicle program by focusing on driving skills and assessments cgg uses in vehicle monitoring

9233   security
our security monitoring established a decrease in the threat level linked to maritime piracy in the indian ocean but an increase in the jihadist
threat in north africa and the middle east in august 2015 one of our subcontracted employees working on an argas land acquisition project
was taken by terrorists claiming to be from daesh sinai branch egypt who claim to have killed him government authorities have not yet
confirmed his death


9234   environment
environmental footprint
land and marine seismic acquisition covered more than 150000 square kilometers in 2015 a surface equivalent to florida airborne acquisition
flew over an area equivalent to france cgg suffered one significant environmental incident namely a diesel oil spill caused by a fuel truck
supplying a land seismic camp in saudi arabia in order to decontaminate the track impacted by the spill a team collected all the contaminated
soil and sent it to an approved waste treatment facility


sound emissions and the marine environment
efficient monitoring is key to mitigating the risk of sound emissions impacting marine life in either physiology or behaviour the graph below
shows that passive acoustic monitoring a technology detecting and localizing marine mammals through their vocalizations has over the last
years been widely adopted as a monitoring tool




cgg achieved significant progress in the efficiency of this monitoring technology thanks to quietsea the integrated passive acoustic monitoring
system launched by sercel in early 2015 quietsea has been deployed on five marine seismic surveys in the north sea indian ocean and the
atlantic the systems robustness and its ability to locate marine mammals more accurately than conventional systems have been demonstrated
the improved marine mammal localizations around seismic sources allow for more efficient risk reduction procedures such as the softstart or
shutdown of seismic sources
the end of 2015 also marked the completion of a twoyear research project financed by cgg whose aim was to better understand the impact
of different types of sound emissions on fish development for the first time independent researchers exposed seabass to different types of
sound emissions such as boat noise pile driving and seismic operations over a long period and observed the resulting physiological effects on
the fish they showed that fish acquire a tolerance to prolonged sound emissions the research results have been submitted to peerreviewed
scientific journals to ensure maximum transparency and value to the wider industry and research community radford et al submitted this
project qualified a scientific methodological approach that can support rd on marine seismic sources with the goal of minimizing their impact
on the marine environment
cgg also continues to support through iagc the exploration  production industrys joint program sound and marine life which since
2006 has provided us55 million to support research the results obtained by the various research projects are published on the site
wwwsoundandmarinelifeorg and have been recognised by several environmental authorities as a significant contribution to better risk
management


9235   skills and training
cgg hse training programs are provided on all company sites at cgg university and in the field substantial efforts were made in 2015 to
develop elearning courses supporting our hse operating management system 27 modules were developed topics previously available only
in the form of procedures  such as preventing malaria managing fatigue safe business travel environmental management corporate social
responsibility  are now covered in a more effective outreach program the variety of formats available educational films elearning courses

9323    training and career development training
the training policy as a lever of individual development and vocational training of employees is a priority of the group which founded its own
corporate university several years ago cgg university
the university provides training courses intended to foster the development of our employees and accelerate the integration of new employees
in the groups various activities it offers internal programs covering our core technical activities seismic data acquisition data processing and
management interpretation geology and reservoirs and seismic equipment these programs are provided by cgg university or in conjunction
with operational centers it also provides technical training for our customers
it is strategic for the company that our employees are prepared to handle business managerial and social aspects of a technology company
this is one of the main drivers that allowed programs on commercial and interpersonal skills to be developed
the learning for development concept continues to be part of the programs deployed it reflects the need for the organization and each
employee to continuously acquire the knowledge and skills they need to adapt to changing technologies and working methods it also reflects
the need to adapt to organizational change and changing internal processes cgg university is organized to ensure that there is a close
relationship between the internal training offer and operations


9324    professional equality policy
measures to promote the employment and integration of disabled employees
the group as specified in its human resources policy rejects all forms of discrimination in employment or during the career of its employees
in particular this concerns discrimination against people with disabilities the group complies with national legislation and does not publish
statistics on the subject due to the nature of its activities and the constraints related to the collection and analysis of information that might exist
in some countries which prevents the group from recording this information in its databases discrimination
in france the group is subject to the law of february 11 2005 on equal rights and opportunities as well as the participation and citizenship of
people with disabilities

933      main results relating to employees

9331    situation and developments in 2015
in 2014 the group engaged in an ambitious transformation plan to adapt to very adverse market conditions and preserve the soul of the company
while aiming to shift from a seismic acquisition company to an integrated geosciences group the plan continued in 2015 with the following key
events
           implementation of a more centralized more effective and more fluid governance and organizational structure
           reduction of the marine acquisition fleet to address supply and demand issues in the sector
           announcement of an employment protection plan in france

 exits include both voluntary departures retirement resignations
 etc and involuntary departures redundancies departures break
 down as follows




over the whole of 2015 a balance of 32 people has been deducted for contract suspension or effective transfer to a joint venture
the decrease in our activity resulted in us recruiting considerably fewer employees in 2015 internal mobility was focused on via a global online
tool always in a consistent and unified framework on all business lines and geographic areas cgg continues to be at the forefront of innovation
and develop the experience and expertise of its teams
the group maintains close relations with schools and universities and continues to participate in forums and educational programs to inform
schools and universities on geosciences these programs are notably implemented by trade associations such as the seg society of
exploration geophysicists and eage european association of geoscientists  engineers
this promotion initiative is combined with work placement opportunities and first experiences abroad in a number of forms school work
placements apprenticeships and vocational training contracts industrial research training agreements cifre contracts ivp etc


9332     working environment
employees are subject to compliance with the working times stipulated in the social regimes of their countries of assignment
prospector contracts are contracts that provide for rotational work arrangements such as five weeks of work for five weeks of rest in marine
acquisition land acquisition rotations are more flexible according to the nature and duration of projects
in france group working conditions are governed by a specific company labor agreement whose terms have been adopted in consultation with
social partners this agreement is common to the parent company cgg sa and cgg services sa as part of the implemented ues economic
and social unit it does not include sercel sa which is subject to the collective bargaining agreements for the metallurgy industry


four types of working schedules are provided for in this collective bargaining agreement
          two regimes are for people working in offices or workshops timesheets and timebyday
          one is for annualized prospectors set number of days of work per year who work in rotation
          one is for nonannualized prospectors who acquire rest days based on the number of days worked in the field
employee working rhythm is governed by an agreement on the reduction of working hours signed on august 27 1999 and implemented following
the principle of annualization by the implementing agreement of february 17 2000
a working time account was implemented in parallel with the implementation of the 35 hour working week similar schemes regarding work time
planning have been implemented on sercel sas french sites

  absenteeism
  the groups absence management tool generates statistics for key countries within the limits of local laws and data reliability which is constantly
  improving it is important to note that these figures are difficult to compare as the notions of work and absence are diverse and longterm
  absences are not taken into account in the same way by the various local laws
  in 2015 homogenized absenteeism rates excluding equipment and parental leave are listed below and compared with available national
  statistics year availability dependent on country similar scope ie absences for illnesses and accidents only cgg is well positioned with rates
  that are lower than the national averages available

941      main social responsibility focus areas
in the area of social responsibility cgg focuses its efforts on the fight against corruption described in section 9122 of this chapter respect
for human rights its relationships with local communities as well as their development


942      policies applied to social responsibility
in the hseoms introduced early 2015 social responsibility is a distinct domain covering all group activities that could have an impact on the
social environment of our operations

9421    human rights

the groups sustainable development policy stipulates that cgg as a member of the un global compact acknowledges and promotes the
ten principles derived from the universal declaration of human rights the ilos declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work
the rio declaration on environment and development the united nations convention against corruption and the united nations declaration
on the rights of indigenous people
in addition cgg human resources policy prohibiting child labour clearly states that the minimum age to work for cgg or for one of its service
providers is 16 young workers aged 1618 are extremely rare at cgg and are subject to additional supervision and precautionary measures
aimed at protecting their health safety and integrity
training courses in the hseoms system for the hse community and managers all include a component related to these issues this also
applies to hseoms audits verifying that the principles adhered to by the group are put into practice
as a last resort the whistleblowing procedure is available to any employee who wants to report a human or labour rights issue to the ethics
committee this mechanism is described in section 9121 promoting an ethical culture and conduct of this chapter

9422   managing relations with local communities
developing and maintaining harmonious relations with local communities is paramount to the success of the group operations especially for
obtaining access to land in order to image their subsurface cgg undertakes to respect and discuss with the local communities living close to
its seismic acquisition projects
on seismic acquisition projects relations with local communities are generally managed by the clients who are likely to operate in the survey
area for much longer than cgg as a responsible partner cgg nevertheless cooperates with the procedures implemented by its clients
on all its multiclient seismic acquisition projects cgg assumes sole responsibility for relations with local communities projects where there
are frequent interactions with local communities are thus closely managed and cgg applies its expertise acquired over many years through its
permitting teams
to safely complete acquisition projects line management and the dedicated permitting teams identify the associated stakeholders and initiate
a dialogue as early as possible in the project they define the most responsible way of accessing their operating grounds to coexist with their
activities whether on land or at sea the evaluation of the risks and opportunities related to our community relations is part of each project risk
assessment pra
cgg continues to promote documentation developed to support seismic acquisition activities in managing community relations and highlight
the best practices fieldproven by the permitting teams the community relations management plan crmp and its four associated guides
management of fishing activities management of permitting and access to land managing local temporary staff during onshore surveys and
implementation of a sustainable development project enable closer management in areas where cggs seismic acquisition surveys could
significantly impact life and activities of a community this is for example the case for marine surveys in heavy fishing grounds or land surveys
in urban or cultivated areas


9423   local content
cggs presence in 43 countries opens up tremendous opportunities for it to make a positive contribution in a number of areas to the social and
economic environment of the communities hosting its operations

employment
seismic acquisition whether on land or at sea is nomadic and temporary by nature consequently cggs ability to recruit and obtain supplies
locally is a crucial factor for success our land survey projects therefore try as far as possible to continuously employ local staff during several
successive surveys the guide managing local temporary staff during onshore surveys associated with the crmp described above provides
assistance for operations management on this critical issue

local procurement for land surveys
during land acquisition surveys cgg is particularly committed to contributing to the development of the acquisition region by sourcing locally
see the responsible procurement section below

partnerships with universities and donations of software for educational purposes
in order to be able to recruit a qualified workforce from close to our centres efforts have been implemented for several years through training
programs and partnerships with local universities consequently cgg has signed a number of cooperation agreements worldwide providing for
the donation of hampsonrussell reservoir characterisation software or geovation seismic data processing software licences

9424   responsible procurement
procurement of goods and services is significant at cgg representing 64 of the turnover in value cgg is committed to managing suppliers
and subcontractors to ensure their respect of hse human rights and anticorruption policies norms and standards the purchasing department
has therefore developed methods and tools among which the supplier code of conduct which describes the minimum social and environmental
standards expected from our suppliers in particular with regard to compliance with international conventions on labour rights and human rights
acquisition projects make regular use of service subcontracting the framework agreements that have been developed for these service
provisions precise cgg expectations regarding respect for human rights respect of these rights is subsequently verified during audits of cggs
operational management system for health safety and the environment hseoms
the procurement procedure specifies the responsibilities and code of conduct that each employee interacting with a service provider is required
to comply with other procedures specify the suppliers management of hse aspects and the way in which they are assessed


943     main results achieved for corporate social responsibility

9431   human rights
since 2013 cgg has been a gc advanced member of the global compact underlining its advanced level of implementation and higher
degree of engagement concerning the issues of human rights and labour rights
the 40 audits carried out in 2015 all verified the application of the fundamental rights at work such as eliminating forced labour and child labour
nondiscrimination and respect for freedom of association audit observations concerning respect for human rights are reported to management
and are included in the project assessments

9432    managing relations with local communities

in 2015 cgg was responsible for managing relations with local communities on marine surveys in australia brazil colombia gabon india
malaysia norway uk and vietnam as well as in algeria egypt saudi arabia and thailand land seismic acquisition projects no significant
detrimental consequences to the communities have been noted or reported good practices aimed at developing the community health or
capacities have been identified in algeria ten medical beds two air conditioners one resuscitation pack twenty glucometers twenty blood
pressure monitors and other basic equipment have been offered to the nearest hospital to the land seismic camp on the coast of the state of
barreirinhas brazil 78 artisanal fishing vessels were equipped with deflectors local smallscale fishermen were offered training during which
they were taught about their use which allow their boats to be detected by vessels operating in their fishing zone with regard to the contribution
to the community health the most widespread best practice on the permanent sites consists in organizing blood donation drives the calgary
houston massy mumbai perth and rio de janeiro sites have organized drives for several years
cgg has also continued the community relations program initiated in 2012 in brazil pernambuco aimed at developing the abilities of several
fishing communities operations already made possible by this plan include training the fishermen in the techniques of sustainable fishing and

africa granting the geoscience department a multiuser geovation licence free of charge this donation accompanied by a donation of computer
equipment and a 2week onsite training course for 3 persons including the head of the research department has already produced results it
has allowed the first seismic research centre to be opened at the university attracting a number of phd students in seismic reflection these
students processed and interpreted existing seismic data thereby contributing to improving knowledge and to the development of several south
african energy basins

96          reporting scope and method

961      selection and pertinence of indicators

published data is intended to inform stakeholders of cggs sustainable development results for the current year it is in line with iogp and
global reporting initiative gri recommendations on information transparency regarding social responsibility and the environment the
information retained followed a materiality analysis process involving the consultation of internal and external stakeholders
indicators were selected to monitor
       cggs hse and sustainable development commitments and policies integrated in management systems
       performance relating to cggs main risks and impacts
       regulatory obligations the french commercial code which was updated in 2012 by a decree implementing article 225 of the grenelle ii
        law

the 42 themes mentioned in the decree are handled as transparently as possible some are not reported on in great detail for the following
reasons

      measures for consumer health and safety

       cgg mainly provides services to its industry clients and is not in contact with consumers the equipment division which sells industrial
       seismic products trains its clients to use its products and provides all information about the components used to date the group has not
       been informed of any adverse effects

      consumption of raw materials and measures to improve efficiency in their use

       the consumption of raw materials within cgg is limited to the equipment business line the ecodesign approach to equipment
       manufacturing aims to minimize the use of raw materials the reduced product weight is generally indicated on the product factsheet to
       inform the customer in addition a due diligence has been conducted to determine whether the minerals used in our manufacturing stem
       from the democratic republic of congo and its neighboring countries

      water use and supply according to local constraints

       cgg does not use much water volume estimated at 347000 m3 in 2015 land acquisition projects in desert or waterstressed areas are
       also consuming a very limited amount of water average of 160 liters per employee per day on our 2015 algerian operations
       environmental risk assessment and management plans established prior the start of land acquisition projects integrate the protection of
       local water resources

      prevention recycling and waste disposal measures

       the prism and sercel databases provide detailed information on the categories and quantities of generated waste waste including
       hazardous waste is however not material enough at group level to require detailed reporting about 12000 tons of waste were generated
       in 2015 75 of this waste was nonhazardous permanent sites vessels and land acquisition projects have developed waste
       management systems that all include the same principles avoid reduce reuse and treatrecycle

      adaptation to climate change

       climate change should not have a significant impact on the groups activities in the shortterm the group also strives to continuously
       reduce its environmental footprint and improve the use of resources such as energy

    measures to enhance biodiversity

     the group is particularly committed to minimizing the environmental footprint of its activities so as to not impact habitats and their related
     biodiversity

    soil use

     most of cgg permanent sites are located in highly urban areas and have not caused any cropland loss land seismic acquisition projects
     that require to access crops or cultivable land are tightly managed by a permitting team in order to prevent or reduce potential damage
     compensation systems are agreed upon whenever necessary

    amount of provisions and guarantees for environmental risks

     cgg has not established any provision for environmental risk the amount of guarantees is considered confidential

    use of renewable energy sources

     most of the energy used by cgg is for the marine or land transport of marine and land acquisition activities these activities lend
     themselves poorly to the use of renewable energies especially as seismic vessels or vibrators are refueled during surveys to minimize
     trips to port or seismic camp cgg permanent office locations do consider the use of renewable energy where available on a case by case
     basis for example all british cgg sites are supplied with electricity produced from a mix of wind wave solar biomass and hydro power


962     methodology

cgg hse reporting procedures are based on the groups event reporting recording and classification guidelines
social reporting consolidation rules and adjustments are defined by a protocol to ensure comparability and traceability of the information
provided

963     reporting scope

health safety environmental and social reporting concerns all employees and contractors working in cggs prevailing influence namely all of
our sites and acquisition activities that are at least 50 cgg owned and which are consolidated in the groups financial statements
as an exception to this rule hse reporting also covers the operations of

     argas in the middle east
     amadeus and binh minh the ships operated by cgg through the ptsc cggv geophysical survey company limited joint venture in
      vietnam
unless otherwise specified all statistics provided in this report include this scope which accounted for 52 million hours worked in 2015
data associated with acquisitions is recorded as soon as possible and no later than january 1 of the following year sales activities are recorded
in the month following their actual output


964     consolidation and internal controls

hse data is reviewed on a weekly basis by hse support functions the data is then consolidated every month at business line and group
level data pertaining to certain specific indicators are calculated directly by the businesses these processes undergo regular internal audits

social data is stored in the human resources information system by local human resources administrative entities or through a special
structure set up for this purpose employee service center for north america this data is checked at three levels

   a level of sox compliance via annual audits and setting up of control points for individual data such as gender birth dates seniority
    wages promotions tax situations type of contract etc
   a level of compliance via the pay slip or monthly time sheet when the base is coupled to an hrms payroll engine
   a level of compliance regarding organizational reporting lines belonging to a given business family a division a function a business line
    etc is done by checking made by operational and functional hr managers at the time of the monthly or quarterly reporting




                                                                                                                                        page  35

     2    limited assurance on csr information

nature and scope of the work

we undertook approximately fifteen interviews with the people responsible for the preparation of the csr information in the different departments
of sustainable development human resources and hse in charge of the data collection process and if applicable the people responsible for
internal control processes and risk management in order to

   assess the suitability of the criteria for reporting in relation to their relevance completeness reliability neutrality and understandability
    taking into consideration if relevant industry standards
   verify the implementation of the process for the collection compilation processing and control for completeness and consistency of the
    csr information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the csr information

we determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the csr information in relation to the
characteristics of the company its social and environmental issues its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry best
practices

for the csr information which we considered the most important11

   at the level of the consolidated entity we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information
    organisation policies actions etc we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified on a test basis the
    calculations and the compilation of the information and also verified their coherence and consistency with the other information presented
    in the management report

   at the level of the representative selection of sites that we selected12 based on their activity their contribution to the consolidated indicators
    their location and a risk analysis we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook detailed tests
    on the basis of samples consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation the sample selected
    therefore represented for example 19 of total headcount 7 of lost time accidents 6 of energy consumption

for the other consolidated csr information we assessed their consistency in relation to our knowledge of the company

finally we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided if appropriate in the partial or total absence of certain information

we consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgment allow us to express
a limited assurance conclusion an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive verification work due to the necessary use
of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system the risk of nondetection
of a significant anomaly in the csr information cannot be entirely eliminated

conclusion

based on our work we have not identified any significant misstatement that causes us to believe that the csr information taken together has
not been fairly presented in compliance with the criteria

                                  no  noncompliance with the afepmedef code in relation to independence criteria


    these criteria are the following


    criterion no 1 not to be an employee or an executive director of the corporation or an employee or director of its parent or a company that it
    consolidates and not having been in such a position for the previous five years
    criterion no 2 not to be an executive director of a company in which the corporation holds a directorship directly or indirectly on in which an
    employee appointed as such or an executive director of the corporation currently in office or having held such office going back five years is a
    director
    criterion no 3 not to be a customer supplier investment banker or commercial banker
                that is material for the corporation or its group
                or for a significant part of whose business the corporation or its group accounts 
    criterion no 4 not to be related by close family ties to an executive director
    criterion no 5 not to have been an auditor of the corporation within the past five years
    criterion no 6 not to have been a director of the corporation for more than twelve years
    criterion no 7 not to represent a significant shareholder of the company holding more than 10 of the voting rights


    with regard to the criterion relating to the business relationship there is no business relationship between on the one hand directors andor
    companies in which they hold an office and secondly the company or its group therefore in the absence of such relationship in 2015 the
    board of directors did not have to assess the significant nature of any business relationship with regard to criteria determined in relation with
    the characteristics of the company and the business relationship in question
    finally the board of directors also confirmed that mr remi dorval who qualified as independent before his appointment as chairman of the
    board continued to meet all of the criteria set out by the afepmedef code
    in its meeting held on march 2 2016 the board therefore confirmed that seven out of the twelve directors who were sitting on the board at that
    time qualified as independent ie more than half of the board members which is compliant with the recommendation of the afepmedef

    update on the companys application of the principle of a balanced representation of men and women on the board of directors
    pursuant to a law dated january 27 2011 and the afepmedef code the board of directors has taken the initiative to better balance the
    women and men representation in the board as of the date of the present report with five women on the board out of twelve directors the
    number of women in the board is exceeding 40

    13 the afepmedef code recommends that independent directors should account for half the members of the board of directors in widely

    held corporations without controlling shareholders

iii7   reasonable assurance
every system of internal control however welldesigned and effective has inherent limitations notably there is an inherent risk that controls
may be circumvented or bypassed this means that the internal control system can offer only a reasonable assurance as to the reliability and
sincerity of financial statements furthermore the effectiveness of internal control procedures may vary over time in response to new
circumstances
