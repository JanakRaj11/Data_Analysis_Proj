  csr in our dna for 400 years
  for 400 years the sumitomo and mitsui conglomerates
  have remained true to their original business spirit
  in the past the sumitomo group undertook largescale
  afforestation programs to solve the problem of pollution
  around the besshi copper mine the group    s starting
  venture on shikoku island in order to return devastated
  mountainsides around the mine complex to their natural
  state they invited experts to compile an afforestation plan
  with annual planting of over one million saplings                          bessi copper mine in the meiji era and today
  meanwhile the mitsui group established the mitsui
  charity hospital in tokyo in the meiji era late 1800s to
  provide basic medical services for those too poor to be
  covered by the health insurance system since then the
  institution has evolved over the generations into today s
  mitsui memorial hospital
  smfg has carried this dna down to the present we
  believe that we have further roles to play in resolving
  social issues through our core financial services business

               step 2
               reexamination and identification through dialog with experts

                  in february 2014 we conducted a dialog with selected group of
                  experts on ourissues thought likely to be important over the
                  mediumtolong termandissues that must be effectively
                  addressed in order to construct a solid management systemto
                  check from the perspective of social nature environment and
                  global issues whether sufficient consideration and recognition had
                  been given to all the issues that should be put forward as candidate
                  priority issues and to ensure that no important issues had slipped
                  through the net
                  after carrying out step 2 we conducted revision in line with the opinions expressed and identified the
                  priority issues to be addressed by smfg after receiving the approval of the experts

               step 3
               reporting to group top management and receiving approval

                  in march 2014 the group s management committee gave approval for the priority issues materiality that
                  smgf should address through the group csr committee and the csr liaison committee
                  moreover approval was received for the examination of specific methods of addressing priority issues after
                  discussion and review with stakeholders both within and outside the group and each group company

               step 4
               review through engagement

                  from july 2014 we have collected opinions from in and outside our
                  group through employee surveys held during internal training and

     clarifying matters and issues that smfg should
     address in order to get towhere we want to
     be ten years from now

 to get towhere we want to be ten years from nowin
 terms of the priority issues ofenvironment next
 generationandcommunitythat were identified in fiscal
 2013 we clarified the matters and issues that smfg should
 address to drive a pdca cycle for determining more
 concrete action
 in clarifying these matters and issues we looked not only at
 the csr issues that are considered important by group
 companies but also at those that matter to our
 stakeholders furthermore we held a dialog with a number
 of experts to check whether sufficient consideration and
 recognition has been given to the matters and issues that
 smfg should address and ensure that none have slipped
 through the net
 moreover to comply with the gri g4 guidelines we created
 an association between the matters and issues to be
 addressed and the specified standard disclosure items and
 held a discussion about boundaries

  regarding priority issues for stakeholders we refer to the issues
 listed in the sustainability accounting standards board s
disclosure topics for financials sectorand the issues for the
 financial sector summarized in the nippon csr consortium held by         dialog with experts

 experts who attended the dialog                      selection of opinions
                                                      i think smfg should place even more emphasis on using its financial functions to
                                                        provide solutions for social problems
                                                      there is a call for the group to expand its initiatives on human rights
                                                      the targetcommunityshould take into account not only domestic and overseas
                                                        but also investeesperspectives
                                                      employees require education and awarenessraising in order to make an impact
                                                        with their daily work operations including on the individual human rights of
