in my role as aboriginal liaison officer im focused on helping hudbay build relationships
with first nations communities near our manitoba projects and operations in manitoba they
are mathias colomb cree nation opaskwayak cree nation and pimicikamak cree nation
and we are continuing to work with other manitoba first nations in saskatchewan the
communities we have relationships with are the peter ballantyne cree nation namely pelican
narrows sandy bay and deschambault lake we want to foster dialogue based on trust and
respect and work together with first nations communities to achieve mutual goals

recognizing that we needed to go back before we could go forward one of my first projects
after joining hudbay was to organize aboriginal cultural awareness workshops for company
leaders since then ive also worked with first nations groups to overcome some of their
misconceptions about mining this has included inviting them to our site for mine tours and
developing an educational toolkit that explains the mining process and how we work in the
coming year ill be visiting first nations high schools to talk about mining as a career option
the sector represents canadas largest private employer of aboriginal canadians

the company and neighbouring first nations communities have much to learn from each
other and the willingness to talk and listen is a great start

i joined hudbay in 2011 to lead one of the teams that manage relations with the
communities in constancias direct and indirect areas of influence im proud to say that
weve come a long way in a very short period of time

over the course of seven months and 28 roundtable meetings we negotiated more than
1000 hectares of surface rights agreements with the communities of chilloroya and
uchucarco without these agreements the project could not have proceeded not only do
the agreements give hudbay rights to communityowned land for the life of mine they also
represent a significant investment in the development of both of these communities and
thats good for everyone involved

were now in the process of negotiating interinstitutional agreements with communities
in our indirect area of influence these arrangements would commit us to working together
on social development projects all in all its challenging but exceptionally satisfying work

safety has long been a priority for me particularly since a family member was seriously
injured in a workplace accident at another company in south africa ive worked for hudbay
for almost five years and am currently the maintenance supervisor at the flin flon mill

i was a safety representative when my department sent me to the pass masters course
pass which stands for positive attitude safety system is based on having regular
facilitated discussions to increase each persons involvement in recognizing and managing
workplace risks from the course i came to realize that if we combined pass with all of the
other safety processes we have in place at hudbay we could have an exceptionally safe
and productive work environment

for me the key to success is knowing pass and the companys systems from a to z and
being a good and consistent role model of safe behaviour

i joined hudbay in early 2012 after having spent more than 30 years training and
counselling vulnerable people in colombia  mainly elders children households led by
women and people who have been displaced by violence my role at hudbay is to begin to
build relationships with communities in the areas where the company is doing grassroots
exploration we want to establish a climate of trust and cooperation and maintain direct
contact with local families

my work involves informal discussions with residents formal meetings visits to homes
participatory workshops and community lunches sometimes the focus is on introducing
people to hudbay and the type of work we are planning at other times i conduct
workshops on healthy family living conflict resolution communication and other life skills
to foster dialogue and help people live together peacefully i also identify informal leaders
in the community and gather socioeconomic data to help us better understand the people
around our operations and how we can best help them improve their quality of life

were laying the groundwork for constructive relationships and the community feedback
to date has been highly favourable

community relations in peru

the new mining model set forth by the government of peru
calls for high standards of social inclusion in mining projects
to ensure that we meet expectations and address the needs
of our various constituents we are implementing targeted
strategies for key stakeholder groups

direct area of influence
the two communities within our direct area of influence
are uchucarco and chilloroya both of whom signed life of
mine land use agreements with us in 2012 in exchange for
portions of their communityowned land the agreements
set out hudbays commitments to local employment and
use of local suppliers and to investments in health
education production and social development projects
among other things development committees comprising
hudbay and community representatives approve and
oversee the projects being carried out within the context
of the agreements

indirect area of influence
our environmental and social impact assessment identified
seven communities in our indirect area of influence we
did not acquire land from these communities but they are                      our stakeholders
neighbours and we want to engage them in our work we
are in the process of negotiating agreements with each of                      during our most recent materiality review conducted

its my job to ensure that the constancia project meets its commitments with regard to
environmental protection and complies with all applicable standards and regulations

one of our key areas of focus is water management large volumes of water are needed
for mining operations at the same time fresh water is absolutely essential to the health
and sustainability of the nearby communities and ecosystem its our responsibility to
ensure that we do everything we can to manage this valuable resource wisely we have a
firstrate team in place and i really enjoy working with them to create an environmentally

waste management

all hudbay operations have waste management plans to
reduce reuse recycle and responsibly dispose of the waste

tsm protocols for managing tailings tailings are piped into                and particulates containing heavy metals we
secure engineered impoundments known as tailings dams                     have a particulate monitoring program in place
mac guidelines address best practices for the location                     and ensure that particulate levels remain below

closure and reclamation

all mines have finite lives and all hudbay mines and
development projects have closure plans and supporting
financial provisions once mining is finished we aim to
leave behind land that will support productive uses for
future generations although we have successfully closed
and remediated 19 mines in the course of our history we
learn something new with each project we also continue
to monitor many of our previously closed sites although we
cannot take action without the approval of current owners
and regulators

in june 2012 the trout lake mine ceased operation after
more than 30 years shortly afterwards the mine closure
process began with the cleanup and safe disposal of
chemicals and fuel oils over the next two years we will
remove surface structures seal mine openings stabilize
underground workings treat waste water and then slope
contour cap or cover and vegetate the site in accordance
with the approved mine closure plan once closure and
reclamation are completed and the government approves the
work we will continue water treatment and environmental
monitoring activities at the closed property
                                                                            caribou monitoring

because the mine is connected to the lalor deposit                         we have made a threeyear 45000 commitment

we noted some opportunities to improve the site condition
with the agreement of government and conservation

1	totals for 2009 2010 and 2011 include all sites reported in that year details may not be shown for sites disposed of prior to 2012
2	hudbays manitoba operations produce copper and zinc concentrate from ore mined by hudbay the copper concentrate is sold as concentrate and the zinc
   concentrate is further processed at our flin flon hydrometallurgical zinc plant along with additional purchased concentrate to produce highgrade zinc
   metal because of these multiple input and output streams we have used metal in concentrate based on our mine production as the measure of production
   volume for the purpose of calculating energy intensity
3	water withdrawals does not include some mine dewatering water discharge includes surface runoff that accumulates in containments water discharged
   from the tom valley exploration property is not reported  the value is being reviewed
4	the sale of our ontariobased zochem operation in 2011 left most of our electricity consumption in manitoba with nearly all manitobas electricity
   generation hydro based the emission factor for our electricity consumption is now very low
5	increase reflects gradual leakage due to routine equipment wear found and corrected at the oxygen plant chiller more frequent monitoring has
   been implemented
6 nox emissions are not tracked as the government of canada does not consider the mining sector to be significant emitters of nox
7 significant spills are those that are reportable to government agencies whether by law or in accordance with company policy
8	the increase in hazardous waste disposal from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to disposal of materials related to decommissioning obsolete portions of the
   plant in flin flon
