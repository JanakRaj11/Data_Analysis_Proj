  what are plasticstooil
  technologies
  innovative companies are using chemistry to convert nonrecycled plastics
  into valuable fuels and feedstocks
    companies are transforming used nonrecycled plastics into oil and petroleumbased products these plasticstooil
    technologies which complement ongoing recycling efforts are being embraced as a way to recover clean energy
    from plastics that cannot be economically recycled growing interest and investments in plasticstooil technologies
    can reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and generate oil and other useful products to help power americas
    transportation system and local economies
