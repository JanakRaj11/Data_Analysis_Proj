    of all yang ming colleagues the great
    cooperation of our supply chain partners
    the positive affirmation and support of
    customers investors and stakeholders

    for 2015 by receiving the container vessels which carry in excess of 10000 teus
    each we have made grow greatly profit steadily our main developing strategy
    according to alphaliners information the coming large container vessels are
    expected to increase to 60 thousand teus and as a consequence we can become
    one of the worlds top 10 carriers however the growth of the fleet is not our
    ultimate goal the relevant business integration the operation of vessels terminals
    containers and the internationalization and innovation of human resource are our
    responsibility

expectations

    stimulus brought by the dropping cost of energy in mainland china the growth speed
    is evidently running slow and the situation is still uncertain in japan even with the
    backup of massive economic policies as for the bunker price it remained high during
    the ﬁrst three quarters but plunged below usd 400 per ton rotterdam ifo in the
    ﬁnal quarter of the year

    moves in 2014 is 51 and the effective capacity is 47 according to drewry
    container forecaster however the actual supplydemand equilibrium is still out of
    reach since the global supplydemand index provided by drewry reveals the ﬁgure

rate is almost unattainable under such condition making carriers recourse to every
measure aimed for cost reduction ranging from ordering megasized ships during
the downturn of building price to implementing slowsteaming strategy to improve
cost structure about 58 of the delivered ships in 2014 can carry more than 10000
teus and the slowsteaming measure helps to ingest 13 million teus reported by

co2 emission from marine shipping industry is estimated to be about 84 billion tons
every year which is equivalent to approximately 3 of the worlds total co2 emission
with increase in international trade marine shippings carbon emission still grows
coupled with rising fuel prices in recent years yang ming must take advantage of
new technologies to reach the goal of carbon reduction

to reduce carbon dioxide emission the international maritime organization imo
has developed a variety of standards including the eedi energy efﬁciency design
index and seemp ship energy efﬁciency management plan two standards are
mandatory requirements and entered into force in january 2013 new ships of 400
gross tonnages and above must reduce carbon emission by 10 and another 10
decrease will be requested from 2020 to 2024 after 2024 the reduction target is
30 new and existing ships have to establish a seemp which should clearly list the
control measures taken for improving energy efﬁciency

the imo has developed various standards and steps to gradually reduce emission of
