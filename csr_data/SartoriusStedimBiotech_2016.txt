following areas of focus


regional growth initiatives

regionally north america and selected countries in
asia are at the focus of sartorius growth strategy

north america is the worlds largest market for the
manufacture of biopharmaceuticals because this
market is home to the main competitors of the group
we historically had lower market share in this region
than in europe and asia accordingly sartorius stedim

strengthening its sales and service capacities and
reorganizing its sales and distribution processes

     cash outflows of 539 million related to acquisitions      aforementioned buildup in working capital and higher

production and supply chain management

sartorius stedim biotech operates a welldeveloped
global production network with plants in europe
north america and asia the largest production sites
are located in germany france and puerto rico
sartorius stedim biotech also has manufacturing
operations in switzerland the uk tunisia and india

each of our production sites fundamentally serves as a
center of competence for particular technologies the
groups biggest plant in goettingen for example
concentrates chiefly on the production of membrane
filters whereas the aubagne and mohamdia sites
primarily manufacture singleuse bags our plant in
yauco supplies membrane filters and singleuse bags
principally for the us market the guxhagen site
specializes in bioreactors and other systems for
bioprocess applications it collaborates closely with the
bangalore site which mainly produces stainless steel
units for these systems

in response to its doubledigit growth sartorius
stedim biotech is making ongoing investments in the
expansion of its production capacity as well as the
optimization of its production processes for instance
an additional casting machine for the production of
filter membranes was commissioned at the goettingen
site and in yauco preparations were undertaken for
the expansion of production in addition production
turnaround times have been shortened at the three
main bag production plants in yauco aubagne and
mohamdia and individual process steps have been
decoupled as a result during the year under review
we were able to improve delivery times for singleuse
bags despite very strong demand

     some time and have strong credit ratings most of our      provisions as well as agreements on mechanisms for
     business areas have a highly diversified customer base    adjustment of the purchase price and on liability
