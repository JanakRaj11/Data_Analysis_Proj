    as technology innovation activities develop rapidly the need to distribute design and development drawings is also increasing to                                         distribution
    strengthen management of drawings that are distributed to suppliers spil establishes a rapid and prompt drawing distribution for
    suppliers management system the process starts with he introduction of customer requirements updated drawings and prompt
    drawing information sharing suppliers can use this eplatform to get the most updated drawing information at all times this system
    saves on paper wastes and efficiently distributes drawings and also reduces much unnecessary paper drawing delivery work this                                        drawing content is     can use system
    system allows suppliers and spil to do our part for the environment                                                                                                   not easily traced      watermarks to trace

    after setting up in the drawing distribution management system the system can be used to distribute the latest edition of spil                        drawing
    drawing this can improve the quality of spil products and reduce unnecessary losses by reducing the suppliers drawing                              conﬁdentiality
    information error the use of this system can continue to reduce supply chain risks and is a mutually beneficial strategy that can
    directly and indirectly improve spil and its suppliers competitive ability and further strengthen the supplier partnership relationship

     expected to improve carbon reduction performance the carbon emission per unit of product at the siliconware technology suzhou
     facility showed an increase in 2015 this was also caused by expansion of production line and heavy use of electricity during the
     process however the expanded production lines are not yet in use which contributed to increase in carbon emissions per unit product

     spils waste management principle is to reduce waste during           in 2015 spil produced 15223 tons of waste of which 70 is nonhazardous waste waste materials are recycled and proportion
     production and recycle resources this company tries to reduce        of reverse recycling reached 36 this was higher than the 31 in 2014 in the future this company will continue to pay attention to
     raw material use during production which not only reduces the        emerging processing technologies and increase the proportion of friendly waste processing
     production of waste but also reduces costs supplier reverse
