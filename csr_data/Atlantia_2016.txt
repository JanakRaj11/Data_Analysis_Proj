dear stakeholders
the groups results in 2015 reinforced atlantias standing as a global player leading in the management of motorway and airport
infrastructures in a context characterized by moderate recovery though still influenced by persisting uncertainties worldwide

in 2015 the variante del valico was inaugurated one of europes most important infrastructures of the last twenty years this infra
structure testifies to autostrade per litalias investment plan and the countrys determination to recover from the economic crisis and
unblock one of the main bottlenecks of the italian infrastructure system

as to airport activities aeroporti di roma accelerated its capex plan reaching euro 335 million nearly doubled since 2014 with
over 46 million passengers combined romes two airports fiumicino and ciampino reached a new record high in traffic despite
the restricted operations at the fiumicino airport from 7th may to 18th july 2015 as a result of the fire at terminal 3

2015 was characterized by a succession of events confirming the increasing attention paid worldwide to the topics relating to sus
tainability the publication of the popes encyclical on the environment the world climate conference in paris and the definition of
the global objectives for sustainable development cdgs on which all the world players are focusing
in this context the group confirmed its commitment and engagement for the seventh consecutive year atlantia was included in the
dow jones sustainability world indexes and in the ftse4good the main indexes at the international level that require increasingly
higher sustainability performances in line with the global compact principles to which the group has adhered since 2004 also in
2015 atlantia obtained the top employers certification recognizing excellence in the management of human resources an area
in which the group grew by over 800 people

another area of excellence is reporting and communication to stakeholders this is the fourth edition of this report drafted accord
ing to the principles of the framework defined by the international integrated reporting council this years edition shows the great
effort expended to make the document easier to read without affecting its completeness and content clarity the standard and the
reporting system adopted enable us to anticipate the effects of eu directive 201495ue that envisages that starting from 2017
nonfinancial data and information be provided in the annual reports
positive results were also reached in safety no fatal accidents were recorded in the workplace and the accident rate on the mo
torway network decreased especially in the stretches with above average accident indexes positive results were also recorded in
airports

the customer satisfaction index in the motorway segment improved further reaching excellent levels and engagement and infor
mation campaigns multiplied including the my way tv channel providing real time traffic updates in an innovative way

increasing attention was dedicated to the enhancement of the artistic and cultural heritage of the territory with the extension of the
sei in un paese meraviglioso you are in a wonderful country project along the motorway network and the development of 10 ep
isodes on the sky arte hd tv channel dedicated to the project moreover the navigare il territorio discover the territory project
was developed to draw attention to the archeological site of portus close to the fiumicino airport

as to environmental sustainability the group continued the implementation of initiatives to mitigate noise and decrease energy con
sumption water consumption was also reduced while segregated waste collection was increased

these are the main results that characterized 2015 our challenge for the coming years is to continue to create value for all of our
stakeholders in accordance with the specific national and international contexts in which the group operates

 the history
                                                                                   sasso marconi
  in 1982 the first design proposal was submitted by the former
     società autostrade
  in 1986 the project was included in the piano generale dei
     trasporti italian general transportation plan
  in 1992 the project was approved by the regions on the local
     level and by anas on the technical level
  in 1996 the government approved the execution of the                            la quercia
     motorway enhancement project
  in 1997 autostrade and anas stipulated a new convention
     extending the motorway concession from 2018 to 2038 and
     the parties undertook  with no surcharge on tariffs  to carry
     out improvements on the a1 motorway section between
     florence and bologna including a more modern and efficient
     section called variante di valico                                      sparvo tunnel
    in 2006 the final administrative authorization for the
      development of the infrastructure was issued                                        badia
     in 2010 the excavation work of the galleria di base tunnel 9

      in 2014 work was completed on all the variante di valico
                                                                                                                  tunnel

 the cost of the infrastructure entirely paid by autostrade per
 litalia increased from euro 25 to euro 41 billion over the years
 as a result of increased raw material costs regulatory changes

 the total delay td index is a summary index representing the level of service and trafﬁc ﬂow on the network since its adoption in
 2006 total delay has decreased by 54 as a result of both the investments made and greater management efficiency

 in 2015 total delay 450 million hours lost in queue increased by approximately 11 over 2014 mainly as a result of increased
 traffic and hours lost due to accidents
