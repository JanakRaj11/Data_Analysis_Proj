pmi joinese waste reduction
pmi joinease pmis joint venture factory in southern china has worked to reduce
waste generation in all aspects of its operations several years ago pmi joinease started
looking at its waste stream as an opportunity for improvement the first step was to
increase the material efficiency of production thereby reducing the amount of raw
materials needed and scrap material produced
                     as a second step pmi joinease invested in an onsite waste sorting
                     facility where employees sort scrap materials to be recycled sold
                     and landfilled to increase the diversion rate in 2012 pmi joinease
                     achieved a 91 waste diversion rate at its facility the factorys focus
                     on material efficiency and waste minimization has decreased raw
                     material and disposal costs and created a new revenue stream from          learn more about the environmental initiatives at

the sustain story
journey of a breakthrough product
guided by the environmental stewardship embedded
in pmis corporate strategy an internal pmi task force was
formed to create a breakthrough product that would enable
consumers to reduce their environmental footprint starting
as a system concept the cup that we know today as sustain
was delivered in 2012
pmi performed an internal life cycle assessment lca
of the sustain 16 oz cup with the support of quantis
software the lca found that after 30 uses the sustain
cup has a 50 less environmental impact than 30 equivalent
singleuse paper cups
the graph below shows the environmental impact of a
sustain 16 oz cup relative to a single use 16 oz paper cup
