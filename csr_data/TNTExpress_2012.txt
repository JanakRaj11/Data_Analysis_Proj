i message from the ceo




highlights 2011
in may following the demerger from tnt nv tnt express started as an independent listed company
tnt express is now a focused express delivery company with a fully engaged workforce committed to
delivering the highest customer satisfaction

our service quality has achieved an all time high with a 96 ontime delivery performance for the one
million daily deliveries that our customers entrust us with this has resulted in 92 of our customers
having their expectations met or exceeded which is an impressive level in our industry our high quality
service has enabled us to retain and develop our business with these customers in addition to winning
new ones

our focus on service has led to a resilient performance in our home market europe and middle east
and africa europe  mea where we offer a bestinclass product portfolio of delivery services and
possess leading market positions

outside of europe  mea we have responded to the rapidly changing market conditions in asia where
we reduced our intercontinental air capacity on china to europe routes we responded quickly and while
this did not fully counter the significant decline in demand it helped reduce the negative impact on
profitability in the second half of the year

our china domestic platform saw excellent growth of our daydefinite deliveries which now account for
nearly 30 of our revenues and place the business on track to deliver the breakeven target set for
2013

our domestic activities in brazil suffered from customer losses at the beginning of the year as the year
progressed we reestablished service quality and gained new volumes from local and multinational
customers laying a solid basis for the companys turnaround

our objective is to provide the best possible working conditions for our employees and to act responsibly
towards the environment in 2011 we continued to invest in health and safety environment and
sustainability partnership initiatives

all these achievements have been made thanks to the dedication of our people and the trust of
customers that work with us as their supply chain partner delivering their business to their customers




                                                                                                          6

                                                                                   overview 2011 and strategy
                                                                                                   chapter 1



however despite our efforts and against the backdrop of a weakening economic environment our
financial performance has suffered this calls for a new strategy that builds on our strengths optimises
our operations and secures new business opportunities

building on strengths
where we come from

tnt express has a tremendous franchise in europe with a unique portfolio of services delivered through
a bestinclass network unrivalled in the industry with tnt express customers in any european
country can send shipments within the country within europe and from europe to the rest of the world

customers are able to choose between express nextday delivery and economy delivery fastest by
road daycertain shipments vary in weight from one kilogramme to one tonne customers value the
ease of service and the onestopshopping experience tnt express offers which saves them time and
transaction costs

and where we are going

with these strengths in mind the executive board reflected on the future and carried out the first
strategic review as an independent company

given our unique european footprint and in response to industry developments we concluded that tnt
express has significant growth opportunities in its home market europe  mea

we envision further expansion opportunities with customers in the healthcare automotive hightech and
lifestyle sectors among others these customers increasingly require innovative and specialised
delivery solutions growth will also come from deliveries of high value goods to residential addresses as
internet purchases are rapidly increasing and replacing traditional shopbased retail purchases our
dense distribution networks complemented by the highest quality customer services in all key european
countries are ideal to service these new customer needs

connecting europe to the rest of the world is another key part of our proposition we will therefore
continue to provide integrated services on key trading lanes in asia for example and in particular
china we will do so via a more asset light model which reduces our exposure to fixed intercontinental
capacity but enhances service to customers through cooperation with select airline operators

for our domestic platforms in china and brazil which are on track to become high growth profitable
businesses over time the immediate focus remains on our shortterm targets in parallel we will also
explore partnership opportunities to strengthen our value proposition to customers and employees while
reducing our financial exposure

looking forward
our 2012 agenda will focus on the execution of our new strategy building on strengths

in addition to the initiatives described above we will reconfigure our networks and infrastructure and
make them leaner and more flexible our european air network will be redesigned to adjust for an
increasing demand from customers for economy express this will lead to the deployment of fewer
aircraft and a move towards a roadbased network in the next three years we will also initiate projects
to achieve savings in administrative processes and within our ics infrastructure all these efforts will
make the european infrastructure more agile and less costly and will allow us to continue to offer our
customers the best service at competitive prices

we are confident that this new strategy which builds on our strengths strong customer relationships
and our highly engaged workforce will significantly improve our longterm performance and create value
for all stakeholders

with my colleagues in the executive and management boards we are proud to be leading tnt
express we would like to thank all our colleagues worldwide for their commitment and dedication to the
success of tnt express

across geographical borders to address europe as one market to leverage this unique position tnt
express is increasing its focus on crossborder parcel flows new competitive rate cards that are
distancebased rather than distinguishing between domestic and international flows have been
implemented and are supported by an increasing number of nextdaybyroad crossborder connections

crossings and are centrally managed ensuring visibility on volume and service where possible tnt
express will supplement these linehauls with customerdedicated direct connections for large
customers thereby reducing handling and transport costs while improving transit times and reducing
damages the intended growth in crossborder volumes will enable tnt express to increase its intra

as mentioned earlier adjusted revenue in europe  mea showed muted underlying growth 21 in
2011

in an increasingly weak economic environment average consignments per day grew by 10 and
average kilogrammes per day by 26 international economy volumes showed healthy growth while
international express volumes declined domestic volumes also grew albeit at a slower pace this
changing product mix was the primary reason for kilogrammes growing ahead of consignments volume
growth was strongest in the united kingdom eastern europe turkey and the middle east in line with
changes in product mix volumes in the air network decreased and road network volumes grew

revenue per consignment rpc increased by 12 supported by a higher fuel surcharge and a higher
average weight per consignment the second half of the year experienced more pressure on average
prices as a result of a weakening economic environment and continued negative customer and product
mix changes various commercial initiatives such as marketing campaigns and internal sales drives
were successfully undertaken to increase european parcel volumes these initiatives generated
approximately 60000 new small and mediumsized trading customers a differentiated pricing approach
was also implemented to support product mix targets with base price increases in international
economy and domestic products and targeted price reductions in international express a new rate
card was introduced to align with tnt express new crossborder service offering customer loyalty
remained high

service quality measured by ontime delivery achieved an alltime high of 95 during the peak season
and was 96 for the full year despite the impact of heavy snowfall in january

to counter cost inflation the company implemented several efficiency and productivity initiatives these
initiatives target cost savings through subcontractor and linehaul productivity improvements and tariff
optimisation lower procurement costs and application of lean methodology to operational processes

the size of the european air network was adjusted to volumes on a quarterly basis although the
volatility in volumes led to lower capacity utilisation compared to 2010 as a result two additional
bae146 were held for disposal the european road network continued to perform strongly in terms of
both costs and service




                                                                                                           25

                                                                                            business performance

despite tight cost control operating income was negatively impacted by weak growth especially in
international express volumes with its associated higher fixed cost base and cost inflation this was
particularly apparent in the second half of the year

higher prices and fuel surcharges drove asia pacifics 71 adjusted revenue growth growth in the
average consignments per day was flat because of weak asiaeurope express demand and lower but
higher quality volumes in australia average kilogrammes per day were lower mainly as a result of the
conversion of ltl into lower weight daydefinite services by hoau hoaus kilogrammes account for
around 60 of all kilogrammes transported in asia pacific

revenue per consignment rpc and revenue per kilogramme rpk grew despite price pressure on
international products as a result of higher revenuequality in domestic china and australia and higher
fuel surcharges in china international and australia

costs were impacted by higher fuel costs for intercontinental services and high inputcost inflation in
asia this was only partially offset by higher rpc and rpk

negative operating income was primarily the result of pressure on international volumes and prices and
the related suboptimal intercontinental capacity utilisation losses in the domestic platforms in india and
china and high fuel costs

tnt express international express activities in greater china suffered a loss in 2011 china to europe
air volumes were lower at the start of the year and while they recovered somewhat in subsequent
months demand remained volatile and weakened again in the latter part of 2011 the impact of weak
demand was compounded by increases in capacity by other integrators and airline cargo providers this




                                                                                                             26

                                                                                             business performance
                                                                                                        chapter 2



led to suboptimal capacity utilisation of tnt express own fleet of intercontinental aircraft profitability
was also negatively affected by high fuel costs

at the beginning of 2011 tnt express operated four boeing 747 freighters to and from asia serving
chongqing hong kong shanghai and singapore two of which were on shortterm leases this
capacity was reduced at midyear in line with weaker demand however at the end of the year tnt
express took delivery of three boeing 777 freighters measures are being taken to limit exposure to
volatile and weaker asia demand in 2012 tnt express intends to further explore capacity reduction
measures including sale of some operations subleases and capacity sharing arrangements

domestic china successfully continued its targeted growth of daydefinite product to reduce the
proportion of ltl services daydefinite grew by more than 100 yearonyear and represented at year
end almost 30 of revenues 2010 15 well on track to realise the projected 40 of revenues in 2013

australia recovered strongly after enduring flooding and strikes in the first quarter of 2011 due to a
combination of successful yield management and cost control initiatives

in 2010 tnt express pursued the integration of the two acquired brazilian businesses expresso
mercúrio and expresso araçatuba the complexity of the integration process was underestimated and
resulted in process and systems failures in addition to the loss of critical employees which in turn
severely affected administrative and service quality this culminated in the loss of major customers at
the beginning of 2011

significant revenue losses and higher costs inflation service quality recovery and provisions led to a
significant negative operating income for the year

in the spring of 2011 a full turnaround plan was initiated which included changes in the management
team organisational structure and key processes and controls these actions restored service levels
and ensured better controlled administrative processes ontime delivery performance was above 95
in the last quarter of 2011 on the back of solid operational performance sales initiatives were
undertaken these resulted in a significant reduction of the revenue gap in the last quarter of 2011 by
the end of the year with operations stabilised the focus turned to controlling costs the turnaround
target of the second half of 2012 is reiterated




                                                                                                              27

  implementation of a fiveyear road safety action plan with an overarching goal of zero fatal
   accidents and
 improvement of tnt express co2 efficiency index by 40 by 2020 compared to the 2007
   baseline the co2 efficiency index combines the operational performance in tnt express
   operational activities road transport air transport and buildings into one indexed metric

tnt express also participates in external evaluations of its cr performance some of which are
described below

years all countries are assessed once every three years by an accredited independent external body
tnt express aims to obtain iip certification for all operations and in 2011 83 of all employees
excluding hoau were working in iip certified sites 2010 80

employee engagement is measured biennially with the global engagement survey  voice a
commitment was made in 2010 to follow up on the key priorities identified from the voice 2010 survey
results and the feedback given by the employees to measure improvement on these key areas a short
pulse survey called voice pulse was conducted in which employees throughout tnt express were
invited to participate all entities took part in the survey with the exception of brazil and tnt innight
the voice pulse survey was not designed to measure engagement

succession and talent management
the management board is committed to the personal development of all employees a particular focus
is placed on identifying recognising and developing employees who have the potential to become future
leaders these employees are calibrated into talent pools and developed to meet tnt express future
needs in terms of leadership capabilities and succession planning the talent groups consist of early
career potentials high potentials executive potentials and executives

global talent development initiatives include development centres and talent development programmes
development centres are designed to assess the competencies required of the employee at the next
level and produce personal development plans to take them to that next level senior management is
involved as observers to provide feedback to employees and as personal coaches to assist in
development planning

talent development programmes are used to support the employees in deploying their personal
development plans the two key global programmes are the leadership challenge which targets high
potentials and the world class leadership programme developed with the imd business school to
support newly promoted executives and executive potentials

to support the career advancement of all potential candidates a vacancy management process for all
positions in job grades a and above has been implemented this ensures that talent pools are used to
fill vacancies and that the right people fill the right positions at the right time vacancies are advertised




                                                                                                               31

ohsas 18001
tnt express has adopted ohsas 18001 certification with regards to workplace health and safety the
objective is to obtain ohsas 18001 certification for all operations in 2011 83 of all ftes excluding
hoau are working in ohsas 18001 certified sites 2010 82

this certification is reinforced with focused accident reduction plans the plans cover seven key areas
leadership workplace safety road safety employee health and wellbeing accident investigation and
monitoring competence and training communications and engagement

accidents
tnt express management is committed to transparency on its social footprint and leads the industry
with regard to reporting on all fatal accidents in both owned and subcontracted operations tnt express
regrets to report 11 fatal accidents in own operations in 2011 2010 13 eight were road traffic fatal
accidents 2010 12 and three were workplace fatal accidents 2010 1 the majority of the fatal
accidents 6 road traffic fatal accidents 2010 9 and all the workplace fatal accidents occurred in
china the 11 fatal accidents resulted in 12 fatalities 5 tnt express employees and 7 third parties

the absolute number of serious accidents excluding hoau increased to 34 in 2011 compared to 27 in
2010 the analysis of this increase has not revealed a common or consistent underlying cause the lost
time accidents per 100 ftes excluding hoau decreased from 309 in 2010 to 290 in 2011

the executive board with the full support of the management board continues to provide focused
support to its operations in china brazil and india road safety is a complex problem especially in
these emerging markets nevertheless continued focus on implementing sustainable improvements and
standards should produce positive results in the long term

fiveyear road safety action plan
road safety has always been a high priority for tnt express in 2011 a revised fiveyear road safety
action plan was issued with a goal of zero fatal accidents by 2015 this plan takes into consideration
changes in road traffic volumes infrastructure and driver behaviour though ambitious tnt express
believes it is necessary to set challenging targets and the action plan is part of tnt express continuous
improvement process

the fiveyear action plan complements the first ever united nations decade of action for road safety
20112020 which aims to reverse the growing trend in road traffic deaths and injuries worldwide
particularly in low and middle income countries the private sector is recognised as a key contributor
and tnt express can play its part

to support the fiveyear action plan all tnt express operations are required to deliver an effective
communication campaign to ensure all employees and subcontracted drivers are aware of the vision for
zero fatal accidents and their role in its realisation

tnt express recognises that employee drivers and subcontracted drivers act as ambassadors for the
tnt express brand and have a vital role to play in reducing road traffic accidents injuries and deaths
while driving a tnt express vehicle tnt express operates a driver recognition scheme that provides
recognition to those drivers that are accidentfree and consistently display proper driving behaviour this
scheme is applicable to both employee and subcontracted drivers the scheme supports and
complements tnt express existing health and safety management system approach to road safety
which focuses on effective vendor driver vehicle and journey management

                                                                                                         chapter 3



carbon reduction plans
each country has developed and implemented carbon reduction plans with clear actions these plans
cover the main impacts and provide guidance on best practices best practices related to air and road
transport include vehicle renewals replacement with electrical compressed natural gas cng and
hybrid vehicles telematics aerodynamics and network optimisation best practice examples related to
buildings include onsite generation and renewable energy sourcing

other best practice examples are aimed at driver performance incentive schemes education and
development of carbon reduction teams

city logistics
during 2011 tnt express piloted the city logistics programme that aims to deliver zeroemission last
mile solutions for innercities four unique solutions have been developed and rolledout in collaboration
with suppliers customers and city authorities these include delivery solutions with electric vehicles
night express services distribution to mobile or microdepots with electric tricycles and a collaborative
solution to bundle volumes through city distribution centres with low emission vehicles

these solutions will be deployed to additional locations with six european cities barcelona berlin
brussels london milan and paris selected to showcase the benefits for cities and customers

road transport
tnt express together with its subcontractors operates a large fleet of vehicles and aims to continue to
improve environmental performance through innovation

the electric vehicle fleet of tnt express and its subcontractors was expanded to include several
additional geographies and now include the united kingdom the netherlands france china italy and
turkey the collaboration with subcontractors to expand their fleet with electric vehicles is an example
of a winwin relationship as mentioned in the next section

tnt express netherlands performed a five month test with a trailer equipped with ecotail a foldable
and retractable rear wing as a result of the test it is estimated that the use of this aerodynamic trailer
tail can reduce truck fuel consumption by 6

air transport
tnt express has taken several initiatives to improve the fuel efficiency of its air fleet and therefore
reduce the co2 footprint initiatives include projects to reduce fuel consumption at takeoff and landing
and route optimisation from improved flight plans

fatal accidents involving subcontractors tnt express is reliant on its subcontractors to report the fatal
accidents involving subcontractor drivers and third parties due to legal obligations and the requirements
of local authorities tnt express is unable to distinguish between blameworthy and nonblameworthy
road traffic fatal accidents

in 2011 tnt express regrets to report 38 subcontractor road traffic fatal accidents 2010 23 the
majority of the subcontractor road traffic fatal accidents occurred in india and brazil 22 tnt express
monitors the accidents involving subcontractors and takes necessary action where appropriate to
terminate contracts with subcontractors that fail to meet tnt express health and safety standards

industry initiative
tnt express is taking the lead alongside other industry leaders in the development of a key initiative to
support european road transport companies in managing their co2 emissions this programme will be
launched in the first quarter of 2012 and is based on the successful smartway programme in the united
states it will drive reductions of carbon emissions by
 establishing a platform for monitoring and reporting carbon emissions that could assist in the
    procurement of transportation services and is based on existing standards
 promoting collaboration between carriers and shippers in driving improvement actions and
    monitoring progress and
 establishing a certification system to reward shippers and carriers that fully participate in the
    programme




                                                                                                            35

this section of the annual report contains an overview of the corporate governance of tnt express
nv and also includes the information and statements that must be provided according to the dutch
governmental decree of 20 march 2009 stb 2009 154

general
tnt express nv is a public limited liability company incorporated in the netherlands with its registered
seat in amsterdam the netherlands and is governed by dutch law tnt express is organised in a two
tier management system comprising of the executive board and the supervisory board the executive
board has ultimate responsibility for establishing the mission vision and strategy for tnt express and is
charged with the overall management and performance of tnt express the supervisory board
supervises and advises the executive board and provides approval for certain important decisions
made by the executive board the two boards are independent of each other and are accountable to
the annual general meeting of shareholders

as illustrated in the diagram on page 43 the executive board is supported by a management board and
dedicated functions that are responsible for internal audit integrity risk management internal control
financial reporting business control legal compliance and human resources in the discharge of their
corporate governance obligations the composition of the management board is described on page 47
of this chapter

tnt express corporate governance structure and processes are based on external regulations
including the dutch civil code dutch financial markets supervision act dutch corporate governance
code and nyse euronext listing rules complemented by company articles of association business
principles bylaws controls and policies that comply with external legal and regulatory obligations and
internationally recognised corporate responsibility standards

foundations of tnt express corporate governance
the executive board is committed to a high standard of corporate governance information and
disclosure in line with the current dutch corporate governance code and regulatory requirements the
executive boards compliance statements relative to the dutch corporate governance code and the
dutch financial markets supervision act can be found on page 16

internal control over financial reporting
the executive board uses the positive elements of former obligations under the sarbanesoxley act in
establishing the companys governance and internal controls over financial reporting icfr
furthermore the executive board has chosen to expand the scope of the internal controls over the
financial reporting framework beyond the minimum requirements that would have been mandatory
according to the sarbanesoxley act to include certain smaller entities and most entities acquired in the
past few years

tnt express specific approach to internal control over financial reporting continues to be generally
based on section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the associated guidance to management
issued by the united states securities and exchange commission in may 2007 in addition the
approach is based on the principles outlined in the auditing standards as 2 and takes into account
certain elements of the as 5 as promulgated by the public companies accounting oversight board
pcaob however tnt express approach to internal control over financial reporting does not imply
an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of tnt express internal control and risk
management processes over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act nor is
there an assessment by tnt express external auditor to that effect

throughout 2011 tnt express documented and evaluated the design of internal controls over financial
reporting in addition tnt express continued a comprehensive programme of testing the operational
effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting further initiatives on entity level controls
were undertaken including integrity awareness and training refer to the integrity section on the
following page and reinforcement of policies and procedures in 2011 the executive board engaged
the external auditor to perform specific agreedupon procedures on the internal control over financial
reporting process in all entities in scope for the icfr programme the executive board believes that
this approach develops the discipline needed to maintain and embed internal control over financial
reporting across the company the findings of the external auditor are reported to the executive board
and the audit committee of the supervisory board

in 2012 the executive board plans to expand the scope and discipline of the icfr approach to non
financial reporting areas in commercial and operational functions




                                                                                                           44

                                                                                    governance and compliance
                                                                                                    chapter 4



risk management and reporting

guidance on integrity is set out in the tnt express business principles and related policies and
procedures these policies and procedures covers among others conflicts of interest gifts and
entertainment corruption and whistleblowing and disciplinary actions the tnt express business
principles are aligned with the un global compact the world economic forum partnering against
corruption initiative principles and the un guiding principles for business and human rights and are
embedded within tnt express strategic and operational decisionmaking processes

by determining where risks are greatest the tnt express integrity programme has been tailored to
effectively mitigate and monitor those risks thus making the most efficient use of the resources that it
can dedicate this risk assessment considers both countryspecific indicators such as the
transparency international corruption perception index and tnt expressspecific indicators such as
audit grades financial performance employee engagement customer base and integrity history the
analysis results in a risk profile high medium low awarded to each entity within tnt express
including its associates and joint ventures each risk profile entails a specific training communication
and monitoring programme within a threeyear cycle

awareness and compliance are enhanced by integrityrelated communication and webbased and in
person training interactive integrity workshops are held for senior and higher management all over the
world in 2011 the integrity department trained 996 managers and employees through inperson andor
webbased training 2010 694 subsequently senior managers as part of their responsibility for the
rollout of the integrity programme cascade this training and communication down into their business
units using the train the trainer model this process is facilitated and monitored by the integrity
department

the monitoring process for integrity includes
 a letter of representation signed by senior management every halfyear
 internal audits
 a comprehensive set of internal controls and
 an annual management self assessment

another important monitoring tool is the tnt express procedure on whistleblowing under this
procedure employees are encouraged to report promptly any breach or suspected breach of any law
regulation the tnt express business principles or other company policies and procedures or any
other alleged irregularities employees can report the breach or suspected breach directly to their line
manager or to the integrity department in 2011 84 reports were received 2010 132 approximately
8 of these complaints involved employmentrelated matters 2010 16 the number of reports
received has decreased yearonyear by 36 the financial impact of the substantiated cases is not
material and appropriate remedial actions have been taken

over the past 5 years the integrity programme has scored 100 in the area codes of conduct and
compliance in the industrial goods and services supersector of the dow jones sustainability indexes
tnt express is proud of this recognition yet will continuously strive to improve and will further rollout
its integrity programme in order to enhance its strong ethical culture

code its articles of association and internal procedures and the rules and regulations applicable to
companies listed on the nyse euronext stock exchange tnt express aims to enhance and improve its
corporate governance standards in accordance with applicable law and regulations with the
implementation of the dutch corporate governance code being the most notable generally tnt
express applies the best practice provisions set out in the dutch corporate governance code an
explanation is given below for those instances in which tnt express does not fully comply with the best
practice provisions of the dutch corporate governance code

best practice provision ii28
this provision includes a stipulation that the remuneration of a board of management member in the
event of dismissal may not exceed one years salary the fixed remuneration component at tnt
express severance payments other than related to a change of control for members of the executive
board are one years base salary severance payments in case of a change of control equal the sum of
the last annual base salary and pension contribution plus the average bonus received over the past




                                                                                                          45

                                                                                    governance and compliance
                                                                                                    chapter 4



three years multiplied by two no distinction is made between resident and nonresident members of

stichting continuïteit tnt express the foundation was established on 31 march 2011 under the laws
of the netherlands the foundation has its official seat in amsterdam the netherlands with its address
at taurusavenue 111 2132 ls hoofddorp the netherlands the objects of the foundation are to
promote the interests of tnt express the enterprise affiliated with it and all stakeholders involved
these objects include protecting tnt express as much as possible from influences that are contrary to
those interests and could jeopardise the continuity independence or identity of those interests the
foundation must endeavour to achieve these objects by acquiring and holding preference shares and
by exercising the rights attached to those preference shares the objects of the foundation do not entail
the sale or encumbrance or other disposal of shares with the exception of the sale to tnt express or to
another company assigned by and affiliated in a group with it as well as the assistance in the
repayment or withdrawal of preference shares

to this end tnt express has granted a call option to the foundation the foundation will have the right
to exercise the call option at any time either wholly or partly when exercising the call option the
foundation is entitled to subscribe for preference shares consisting of the right to repeatedly subscribe
for preference shares up to a maximum corresponding with one hundred per cent 100 of the issued
share capital in the form of ordinary shares as outstanding immediately prior to the exercise of the
subscribed rights less one preference share and minus any shares already held by the foundation

reasons for which the foundation may exercise the call option include
 to prevent slow down or otherwise complicate an unsolicited takeover bid for and an unsolicited
   acquisition of ordinary shares by means of an acquisition at the stock market or otherwise
 to prevent and countervail concentration of voting rights in the general meeting and
 to resist unwanted influence by and pressure from shareholders to amend the strategy of tnt
   express

and with respect to the foregoing to give tnt express the opportunity to consider and to explore
possible alternatives and if required to work these out and to implement them in the event an actual or
threatening concentration of voting rights arises among the shareholders which according to the
provisional judgment of the executive board and the supervisory board and the board of the
foundation is considered to be unsolicited and not in the interest of tnt express and its enterprise
and to enable tnt express to do so by temporarily neutralising such concentration of voting rights




                                                                                                           52

against repayment of the paid amount if preference shares are issued tnt express must convene a
general meeting to be held not later than 12 months after the date on which the preference shares
were issued for the first time or 60 days after the foundation has demanded the cancellation of its
preference shares the agenda for that general meeting must include a proposal for a resolution
relating to the repurchase or cancellation of the preference shares

tnt express has granted to the foundation the right to file an application for an inquiry into the policy
and the course of events of tnt express with the enterprise chamber of the amsterdam court of
appeal ondernemingskamer tnt express believes that this may be a useful option inter alia in the
period before the issuance of preference shares as it does not cause a dilution of the rights of other
shareholders

the members of the board of the foundation are mr bouw chairman mr tiemstra and mrs tonkens
gerkema all members of the board of the foundation are independent from tnt express this means
that the foundation is an independent legal entity in the sense referred to in section 571 paragraph 1

                                                                                                        55

                                                                                    governance and compliance
                                                                                                    chapter 4



   severance payments in case of a change of control are equal to the sum of the last annual base
    salary and pension contribution plus the average bonus received over the last three years
    multiplied by two

other
in the contracts of the members of the executive board a clawback clause is included this clause will
apply in case an erroneous variable remuneration payout has occurred

supervisory board may at its discretion allow all or part of the share allocations to vest on the date on
which control of the company passes in such a case the supervisory board may cap the proceeds of
these shares guided by fairness and reasonableness

in the event of a change in control the proceeds of the unvested share grants will be capped at the level
of the sum of
 the average of the closing prices of the tnt express nv share according to the official price list
     for a period of five trading days prior to the date when the first announcement to make a public offer
     was made and

remuneration in 2011
in 2011 the members of the executive board received base salary rights on oneoff matching shares

contributions to pension provisions the members of the executive board fully waived their entitlements
to 2011 variable income the table below summarises the 2011 compensation elements of the members
of the executive board calculated in accordance with ifrs note ifrs amounts do not represent
actual compensation value

in 2011 due to the demerger all equity schemes were unwound under ifrs 2 the unwinding of
granted performance shares and matching shares qualifies as a settlement that needs to be accounted
for as an accelerated vesting as a result the amount which otherwise would have been recognized
over the originally remaining vesting period is now recognized immediately as cost these unwinding
costs are specified for both the shortterm incentive and the longterm incentive these costs do not
reflect the actual compensation value for each member of the executive board the actual payments as
a result of the unwinding amounted for ms lombard to a gross amount of 85515 and for mr bot to a
gross amount of 148931 both members of the executive board chose to participate at the maximum
level

the amounts included in the columns accrued shortterm incentive excluding unwinding and accrued
longterm incentive excluding unwinding represent the ifrs costs in 2011 of nonvested entitlements
relating to 2011 and previous years

unwinding of tnt nv share schemes
the unvested rights on performance shares and matching shares granted in 2009 ceo and cfo and
2010 cfo were unwound immediately prior to the demerger and all schemes were terminated

both the bonusmatching scheme and the performance share scheme for 2009 and 2010 vested on an
accelerated base the matching shares vested on a prorated basis and were settled in cash there
was no vesting of performance shares since the realised total shareholder return tsr against the
incentive zone of the performance schedule did not allow any vesting an external service provider
calculated the value of performance shares taking into account the remaining vesting period which was
settled in cash as a compensation of the lost vesting period

to stimulate senior management and to align the interests of senior management with shareholders
post demerger the supervisory board of tnt nv decided on a oneoff investmentmatching scheme
in which the proceeds of the matching share scheme and the performance share scheme could
voluntarily be invested in the phantom shares of tnt express after payout of the proceeds the
participants could decide to invest 25 or 50 of their gross settlement but not more than their net
proceeds in tnt express shares on the same date the investment shares were purchased the
participant received free of charge a matching right representing the value in cash of half of the
number of investment shares matching on a 1 05 basis this matching right will vest and the cash
value of the matching right will be paid after three years provided that the participant i has remained
an employee throughout and ii still owns at least 50 of hisher investment shares the cash sum of
the matching rights will be subject to any applicable payroll withholding taxes

both the ceo and the cfo participated in the scheme at the maximum level

members of the executive board
please refer to chapter 1 for details on the members of the executive board

remuneration policy for 2012
the existing executive board remuneration policy is a heritage of the previous company structure the
supervisory board has decided to review the remuneration policy after the demerger given the
challenges of the company in the current volatile economic environment and the international character
of the company furthermore simplicity motivational power transparency and cost effectiveness were
key considerations in developing the new policy

as a result the remuneration committee provided a recommendation to the supervisory board to
adjust the executive board remuneration policy effective as of 2012 the primary goal is to better align
the remuneration policy with the objectives of all stakeholders on one side and with the remuneration
policy for senior management on the other the aim to stimulate management behaviour that balances
the interests of all stakeholders is an important goal of the tnt express remuneration policy the
supervisory board has adopted the proposed recommendations these will be submitted for adoption to
the annual general meeting of shareholders on 11 april 2012 the recommended adjustments to the
remuneration policy are described per element below

remuneration policy 2012 base salary
the supervisory board recommends that the base salaries of the members of the executive board
remain unchanged for 2012 the base salary policy allows for adjusting salaries annually in line with the
average increase in the collective labour agreements applicable to the companys employees in
europe this adjustment will not be applied in 2012




                                                                                                                                                                          57

                                                                                                        governance and compliance
                                                                                                                        chapter 4



remuneration policy 2012 variable income  general
tnt express ambition is to realise financial growth meet its nonfinancial targets and increase its share
price in order to better align the remuneration policy with these objectives the supervisory board
recommends to
 introduce an equitybased longterm incentive to ensure an alignment with shareholders needs and
     a deferral in part of the compensation
 rebalance the shortterm incentive with the new longterm incentive by placing less emphasis on
     the short term and more emphasis on the long term
 synchronize the targets and link all targets partly to shortterm incentives and partly to longterm
     incentives the set targets and their relative weighting reflect the strategy of the company to
     achieve growth in all stakeholder areas

the remuneration committee of the supervisory board analysed the outcome of the variable pay
programme under different share price scenarios the programme delivered in all cases a fair and
reasonable remuneration also taking into account acceptable internal pay differentials

shortterm incentive
    the proposed focus areas for the shortterm incentive consist of
    60 financial targets comprising ebit and net cash flow from continuing operations
    40 nonfinancial targets equally weighted comprising
      employees management development and engagement of employees
      customers client satisfaction
      environment sustainability and health and safety

in 2012 the shortterm incentive opportunity will be lowered an at target performance will be rewarded
with 50 annual base salary 2011 100 a stretch performance in case of realization of a stretch
ebit target will be rewarded with an additional 25 annual base salary 2011 no stretch

as of 2013 the executive board may on a voluntary basis participate in the bonusmatching plan by
investing a maximum of 50 of the gross payout of the shortterm incentive of the previous year but
not more than 25 of their gross annual base salary and not more than their net proceeds in tnt
express bonus shares after a threeyear holding period these bonus shares will be matched oneto
one in the event the performance on the ebit target is met every year during this threeyear holding
period an additional match will be made of onetotwo resulting in a total award of three matching
shares in case of performance below the ebit target there is no delivery of additional matching shares
for that specific year

the matching of bonus shares occurs provided continued employment and if at least 50 of the bonus
shares is retained during the holding period the schedule below describes the vesting schedule of the
general bonusmatching plan and the additional matching related to the yearly performance on the ebit
target during the holding period

the members of the executive board waived the payout of their realized 2011 variable income
therefore they are not eligible to participate in the bonusmatching plan per 2012

longterm incentive
in order to align the objectives of the executive board with the longer term value creation objectives of
shareholders the supervisory board recommends to award members of the executive board
conditional rights on tnt express shares under the tnt express 2012 performance share plan the
grant is based on an ifrs value of 30 of the annual base salary

not sell their matching and performance shares before the earlier of five years from the date of grant or
the end of employment although any sale of shares for the purpose of using the proceeds to pay for the
tax relating to the grant of these shares is exempted

the short and longterm incentive plans for the members of the executive board are fully aligned with
the variable income programmes for senior management the reward under the shortterm incentive
plan the performance share plan and the additional match under the bonus matching plan depends on
the performance on preset financial and nonfinancial targets all targets and objectives are quantitative

going forward the remuneration committee has proposed to the supervisory board two amendments
to the remuneration of the supervisory board both amendments have been approved by the
supervisory board and will be presented to the annual general meeting of shareholders for adoption

   the first amendment consists of the introduction of attendance fees of 2500 for the chairman and
    1500 for members for additional supervisory board meetings over and above the usual business
    calendar this would only be paid in the event of additional workload and aligns with the variable
    attendance fee for committee meetings members of the supervisory board do not receive
    attendance fees for regular supervisory board meetings
   the second amendment consists of a distinction for the travel allowance recognising the significant
    additional time for intercontinental travel for those members of the supervisory board required to
    travel intercontinentally the fixed travel allowance will be increased to 2500 for every meeting
    attended for other members domiciled outside the netherlands the travel allowance remains
    unchanged at 1500 for every meeting attended

v risk management
the development of tnt express business and supporting financial and corporate responsibility
strategies as described in section v of chapter 1 are not without risk risk management is a key process
and an essential element of the companys governance

risk management framework
the executive board supported by members of the management board and dedicated risk
management employees are responsible for identifying prioritising and mitigating risks and establishing
a robust risk management system

tnt express has embedded the committee of sponsoring organisations of the treadway commission
coso enterprise risk management erm  integrated framework 2004 as the foundation of its risk
management framework through the companys risk management framework the executive board
aims to provide reasonable assurance that strategic and business objectives can be achieved the
executive board regularly reviews the risk management framework a new risk management approach
developed while tnt express was still part of tnt nv was rolledout to all tnt express regions
global functions and material operating units in 2011

throughout 2011 the executive board regularly reviewed the companys risk profile as input to these
reviews it used the outcome of 59 risk workshops representing input from all regions functional areas
and 136 entities for those risks deemed to be material comprehensive mitigating action plans are
developed and reviewed regularly by the executive board the outcome of the risk management
process is shared and discussed with the audit committee and the supervisory board as well as with
the external auditor

risk factors
this section describes the risks facing the execution of tnt express strategy

risks have been classified by risk category per the coso  erm and are further divided into specific
risks and inherent risks specific risks are risks that the executive board believes could negatively
impact short to mediumterm objectives inherent risks are those risks that are constantly present in the
business environment and are considered sufficiently material to require disclosure and management in
addition risks relating to the demerger from tnt nv are disclosed

although tnt express believes that the risks and uncertainties described in the following pages are the
most material risks and uncertainties they are not the only ones it may face all of these factors are
contingencies which may or may not occur additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to
tnt express or that it currently deems immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on its
business results of operations or financial condition the sequence in which these risks are presented
in no way reflects any order of importance chance or materiality

strategic risks

specific  strategic risks
a bid for tnt express could result in loss of customers supplier contracts partnership or
divestment opportunities and employees and could distract management in the execution of the
companys strategy this could affect tnt express revenues profitability and service quality
on 17 february 2012 tnt express announced that it received an unsolicited nonbinding and
conditional proposal from united parcel service inc ups for the acquisition of the whole of the issued
capital of tnt express the announcement stated that the supervisory and executive boards carefully
considered the indicative proposal and explored its rationale merits and risks for shareholders and all
other stakeholders and rejected the proposal but continued to be in discussions

a bid for tnt express could have an impact on tnt express ability to attract and retain customers
enter into supplier contracts and conclude partnership or divestment opportunities due to uncertainty as
to the future independence of tnt express employees could also decide to leave tnt express due to
this uncertainty and management attention could be distracted from the daytoday management of the
company there could be significant time between the receipt of an offer and the conclusion of whether
or not to enter into a transaction and the actual closing of the transaction this timing could further
compound the issues noted above

the express business is cyclical and highly sensitive to fluctuations of trade flows which in
case of an economic downturn could affect tnt express revenues and profitability
the express business is cyclical and highly sensitive to fluctuations of trade flows there is a strong
correlation between trade flows and economic development in case of an economic downturn there is a
risk of a sharp decline in trade volumes such decline of trade volumes could lead to a significant
decrease in volumes offered for transport by tnt express which in turn places pressure on revenue
quality this could affect tnt express revenues and profitability

in reviewing the business environment tnt express has concluded that the economic situation varies
significantly by geography and is increasingly uncertain

changes in customer preferences or shipping patterns could result in a shift by customers from
premium services to economy services or a loss of customers which could affect tnt express
revenues and profitability
driven by economic developments or cost rationalisation customers preferences or shipping patterns
could shift from tnt express higherpriced premium services to its slower cheaper economy services
in addition it may also lose customers due to negative economic developments or cost rationalisation
this could affect tnt express revenues and profitability

the integration of acquired businesses may involve significant challenges including costs and
could affect tnt express revenues profitability and financial position
in the past tnt express has made a number of acquisitions the integration of acquired businesses
contains execution risks these risks are compounded in emerging markets that by nature contain
higher levels of market and execution risks

there is a risk that tnt express might not achieve optimal integration of the acquired company in 2010
and 2011 tnt express incurred loss of revenue and additional costs in relation to its acquisitions in
brazil this example highlights the uncertainty in relation to acquired businesses tnt express may
face additional or new integrationrelated costs pursuant to previously acquired companies

the value of the investment in an acquired company may decrease significantly and may be
permanently impaired affecting tnt express financial position

tnt express may decide to sell off some of its entities or exit certain businesses or markets in
the future which could result in additional costs related to closure of operations impairment of
goodwill or other contractual liabilities and could affect tnt express financial position
revenues and profitability
tnt express may in the future either sell off or fully or partially exit certain businesses or markets for
example as a result of changes in strategic focus unattractive market conditions aggressive competitor
pricing policies or protectionist behaviour by governments a full or partial exit could affect tnt express
revenues profitability and financial position because of losses on disposal additional costs from the
closure of operations the impairment of goodwill and other contractual liabilities




                                                                                                          63

                                                                                    governance and compliance
                                                                                                    chapter 4



measures taken to reduce costs including employee redundancies may be delayed andor may
not achieve the results intended and could affect tnt express revenues and profitability
further restructuring measures will be taken in 2012 and affect all company entities such cost saving
targets and initiatives are based on assumptions and expectations that may not be valid restructuring
of operations and other cost reducing measures may not achieve the results intended in addition
restructuring costs and other costs and charges are based on expectations and forecasts if these are
not valid tnt express may incur additional restructuring costs deviations from the forecast savings
and restructuring costs could affect tnt express profitability

intensifying competition in the cep market may put downward pressure on volumes and prices
and could affect tnt express revenues and profitability
tnt express competes with many companies and provides services on a local regional european and
global level its competitors include express companies logistics service providers freight forwarders
and air or road couriers intensified competition through targeted aggressive actions by competitors
may put downward pressure on volumes and prices this may force down volumes and prices for tnt
express services and thus affect its revenues and profitability

inherent  strategic risks
tnt express derives a significant portion of its revenues from its international operations and is
subject to the risks of conducting operations in emerging markets a downturn in these markets
could affect tnt express revenues financial position and profitability
as tnt express has significant international operations it is continually exposed to changing economic
political and social developments beyond its control emerging markets are typically more volatile than
mature markets and any downturn in these markets is typically more pronounced than those in the
developed world a downturn in one or more of these markets could negatively impact tnt express
revenues financial position and profitability

operational risks

specific  operational risks
tnt express may not accurately forecast future infrastructure requirements which could result
in excess or insufficient capacity and affect its profitability
to maintain its market position and encourage future growth tnt express must make ongoing
investments in infrastructure such as aircraft vehicles and depots infrastructure investments are based
on forecasts of future capacity requirements forecasts for future requirements might not be accurate
which may lead to a mismatch between investment and actual requirements

if tnt express underestimates its future capacity requirements customer needs may not be met and it
could lose business market share revenues and profits if tnt express overestimates future needs or
if major contracts are cancelled by customers it may experience costly excess capacity the impact of
over or underestimation of future capacity requirements is particularly significant in regards to major
longterm investments such as hubs major depots and intercontinental aircraft over or under capacity
may severely affect tnt express profitability

the loss of key suppliers and subcontractors or an inability to engage suitable suppliers or
subcontractors could have a significant impact on tnt express operations and thereby affect
its revenues and profitability
tnt express business model depends upon the extensive use of key suppliers and subcontractors
their availability insolvency or bankruptcy could affect tnt express operations and thereby affect its
revenues and profitability

in addition tnt express is dependent on the use of commercial aircraft as part of its global network
operations as a result of aviation security incidents such as those reported in yemen and greece in
2010 many governments have implemented additional security measures for passenger aircraft and all
cargo aircraft particularly cargo sent to the united states on allcargo flights these additional security
measures could result in bans by some airlines or countries on transporting certain items on aircraft
this may increase security costs and impact operations and service quality this would drastically limit
tnt express ability to provide current levels of connectivity and service without significant investments
that could affect its revenues and profitability

tnt express depends on a number of infrastructure facilities for which it has limited or no
comparable backup facilities in addition the business depends on the availability and security
of a bespoke it infrastructure in the event of operational disruptions at one or more of these
facilities and  or an it failure the revenues and profitability of tnt express could be affected
a portion of tnt express infrastructure is concentrated in single locations for which there are limited or
no comparable backup facilities or very expensive backup scenarios in the event of a disruption of




                                                                                                          64

                                                                                       governance and compliance
                                                                                                       chapter 4



operations an example of this is its air express hub in liège belgium the operation of tnt express
facilities is prone to a number of risks including power failures the breakdown failure or substandard
performance of equipment the possibility of work stoppages or civil unrest natural disasters
catastrophic incidents such as aeroplane crashes fires and explosions and normal hazards associated
with operating a complex infrastructure if there were to be a significant interruption of operations at one
or more of tnt express key facilities and operations could not be transferred or could only be
transferred at very high costs to other locations tnt express might not be able to meet its contractual
obligations incur liabilities and revenues and profitability could be affected

in addition tnt express operations administration and customer facing services depend on an it
infrastructure for their day to day operation if one or more elements of tnt express it infrastructure
fails and backup facilities do not operate successfully it may impact tnt express operation and affect
its revenues and profitability

tnt express reputation as well as its profitability could be affected by fatalities as a result of
road traffic accidents air crashes incidents resulting from the transport of hazardous materials
and loss of confidential consignments
tnt express operates a large fleet of vehicles and drivers could be involved in accidents that result in
fatalities tnt express has recorded an increase in the number of road traffic accidents due to
acquisitions in emerging markets and adverse weather conditions in addition tnt express transports
hazardous materials for a number of customers in the automotive biomedical and chemical industries
the hazardous consignments include airbags batteries paint blood samples medical substances dry
ice and chemicals it may also transport hazardous or dangerous goods without notification from
customers of the nature of the goods transported incidents involving these materials could result from a
variety of causes including sabotage terrorism accidents or the improper packaging or handling of the
materials tnt express faces a number of risks by transporting these materials such as personal injury
or loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and environmental
damage

tnt express also transports confidential and sensitive consignments on behalf of some of its
customers it does not always know the confidential and sensitive nature of these consignments and
customers may choose to enter consignments into its network without registering the consignment with
the result that they cannot be tracked and traced

if the number of fatal accidents is not reduced or a significant incident occurred involving the handling of
hazardous materials or if confidential consignments were misplaced or lost tnt express operations
could be disrupted and the company could be subject to a wide range of additional measures or
restrictions imposed on it by local or government authorities as well as potentially large civil and criminal
liabilities a significant incident particularly a wellpublicised incident involving potential or actual harm
to members of the public could damage tnt express reputation

any of these incidents could affect tnt express reputation revenues and profitability

the securing of effective flight slot times and the appropriate licences may result in significant
changes to tnt express operations and could limit its flexibility in operating its business and
affect its revenues and profitability
tnt express operates various types of aircraft throughout europe and between europe and the united
states asia and the indian subcontinent some of the countries in which tnt express operates have
adopted or proposed regulations that impose nighttime takeoff and landing restrictions aircraft
capacity limitations and similar measures to address the concerns of local communities tnt express
relies on nighttime operations at its air express hub in liège belgium for a substantial part of its
international express business a curtailment of nighttime takeoffs and landings at any of tnt express
key facilities such as liège could affect its operations and services that the company can offer to
customers

in addition as the provider of timesensitive delivery services tnt express needs to secure adequate
and effective flight slot times from airport coordination or other local authorities in all the countries and
airports in which it operates the limited availability of these slots could have an impact on the efficient
operations of tnt express timesensitive air and road networks and could result in a breach of its
contractual obligations this could affect tnt express revenues and profitability

inherent  operational risks
a terrorist attack and increased antiterrorism requirements could impose substantial additional
security costs on tnt express and this could affect its profitability
escalating concerns about global terrorism and perceived insufficient levels of aviation security have
caused governments and airline operators around the world either to adopt or contemplate adopting




                                                                                                             65

                                                                                     governance and compliance
                                                                                                     chapter 4



stricter disciplines that will increase operating costs especially for the transportation industry these
enhanced rules and regulations or other future security requirements for air cargo carriers could have a
negative impact on service quality and impose material additional costs and thereby affect tnt express
profitability

tnt express operations and employees are subject to risks related to natural disasters and
extreme weather events that could affect both revenue and profitability
tnt express operations and employees could potentially be affected by extreme weather events such
as the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan and the flooding in new zealand australia and
thailand in the final weeks of 2010 operations were significantly disrupted by extreme adverse
weather conditions which closed many airports and road networks creating significant delays in both air
and road operations

the risk of similar future events is impossible to predict and could affect tnt express revenue and
profitability however the newly developed continuity plans will contribute to the mitigation of the risk

increases to the prices of fuel and energy may affect tnt express profitability
tnt express operations depend on air and road transport as a result fuel and energy costs form a
significant part of tnt express cost base ongoing political and social developments in north africa
and the middle east in addition to other supply or demand developments could lead to an increase in
fuel and energy prices electricity prices might increase further as a result of more stringent regulation of
power utilities under the eu emissions trading scheme rising fuel and energy prices will affect tnt
express own prices to customers and costs in turn affecting its revenues and profitability

risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases including
pandemic influenza which could affect its revenues and profitability
outbreaks of contagious diseases such as h1n1 and sars and other adverse public health
developments could affect tnt express operations and impact tnt express ability to ship
consignments or otherwise make deliveries of products originating in affected countries as well as
cause temporary closure of offices or other facilities such closures or shipment restrictions could
severely disrupt tnt express operations and affect tnt express revenues and profitability

tnt express may also be required by regulation andor by stakeholder expectation to put in place
measures to ensure continuity of operations in the event of such an outbreak and this could increase
costs as tnt express prepares to mitigate such risks

legal and regulatory risks

specific  legal and regulatory risks
investigations relating to antitrust regulations could result in fines that affect tnt express
reputation revenues and profitability
recent investigations into pricefixing andor anticompetitive behaviour by some companies may result
in an increased focus on the transportation sector by regulators tnt express may be required to
cooperate with law enforcement agencies in various jurisdictions as part of a wider industry
investigation such actions could distract management from the daytoday running of the business and
result in tnt express incurring legal costs if the company were found to have acted in breach of anti
trust regulations fines and other sanctions could be imposed which may adversely affect tnt express
reputation revenues and profitability

changes in the shareholder base of tnt express or in the domicile of tnt airways nvsa
could impact tnt express ability to secure and maintain traffic rights in certain countries and
the use of airports which could in turn affect its revenues and profitability
tnt airways nvsa is incorporated in belgium and qualifies as a belgian and eu carrier this results
in a number of privileges including tnt express use of liège airport routings and reciprocal traffic
rights and trade arrangements changing the domicile of tnt airways nvsa or other changes to its
legal structure which result in it not qualifying as a belgian carrier may result in tnt airways nvsa
not being able to use certain airports including liège airport

changes in tnt express shareholder base which could result in the majority of the ordinary shares
being held by noneu shareholders may result in tnt airways nvsa losing a number of its privileges

any of these changes could affect tnt express revenues and profitability




                                                                                                           66

                                                                                     governance and compliance
                                                                                                     chapter 4



failure by subcontractors to meet obligations for social security and other fiscal requirements
could have a significant impact on tnt express ability to provide services reputation and
profitability
in some jurisdictions failure by subcontractors to meet obligations for social security and other fiscal
requirements can result in the hiring company becoming liable if tnt express is held liable for its
subcontractors breach of social security or fiscal obligations its profitability could be affected even if
there are no direct financial consequences the reputation of tnt express could be damaged

inherent  legal and regulatory risks
tnt express operates in many jurisdictions in which it is confronted with complex legal and
regulatory requirements  especially in emerging markets where the legal systems are in varying
stages of development this creates an uncertain business and investment environment with
potential risks which could affect tnt express revenues financial position and profitability
tnt express operates around the globe and provides a worldwide service with facilities in many
countries as a result tnt express is confronted with complex legal and regulatory requirements in
many jurisdictions these include tariffs trade barriers limitations on foreign ownership of assets and
share capital and taxes on remittances and other payments

in many of the jurisdictions in which tnt express operates in particular emerging markets such as
china brazil india russia and the middle east the legal systems are in varying stages of
development this creates an uncertain business and investment environment with related risks these
risks can include the absence of an independent and experienced judiciary the necessity to use
nominee constructs and the possibility that tnt express may be unable to enforce contracts if any of
these risks materialise this might affect tnt express ability to implement its policies and strategies
and might affect its revenues financial position and profitability

tnt express is in the business of transporting goods that are subject to specific restrictions and
regulations a violation could result in fines and administrative sanctions which could affect
revenues and profitability
tnt express provides transportation services to various industry sectors and countries some of which
may be subject to specific export controls customs disclosures and denied parties regulations in
addition tnt express is occasionally required to provide information requested by authorities
investigating transport of certain restricted or regulated consignments to and from certain denied or
restricted parties the controls applied by tnt express may be insufficient to ensure all consignments
comply with all applicable regulations in all jurisdictions this can lead to investigations and operational
measures and in the event of any violations tnt express may be subject to fines and other
administrative sanctions such as discontinuation of service as well as contractual liabilities which could
affect tnt express revenues and profitability

unfavourable decisions by competition authorities concerning joint ventures acquisitions or
divestments could restrict tnt express growth and strategic progress and the ability to
compete in the market for its services this could affect its revenues and profitability
tnt express occasionally seeks alliances with or acquires shares in companies or seeks to divest part
of its business some joint ventures acquisitions or divestments of shares or a business require
approval by the competition authorities and this approval may contain certain restrictions or conditions
with respect to the intended transaction or may not be granted at all this could affect tnt express
revenues and profitability

the legal concept of limited liability for loss of or damage to goods carried by tnt express is
increasingly being challenged and this could result in increased exposure to claims thus
affecting revenues and profitability
tnt express transports goods under the conditions of the international convention regarding the
carriage of goods by air the warsaw convention and by road the convention on the contract for the
international carriage of goods by road these conventions contain provisions that limit tnt express
liability in the event that it loses or damages shipments belonging to its customers

in the past these principles was generally accepted as normal business practice but in recent years
courts and regulators in an increasing number of jurisdictions such as brazil have set aside these
principles of limited liability this exposes tnt express to higher claims and could thus affect tnt
express revenues and profitability

subcontractors might be classified as employees of tnt express which could affect its current
business model thereby affecting tnt express profitability
tnt express hires subcontractors to perform certain aspects of its operations in certain jurisdictions
the authorities have brought criminal actions against subcontractors and in return subcontractors andor
their employees have brought civil actions against tnt express alleging that subcontractors andor their




                                                                                                           67

                                                                                         governance and compliance
                                                                                                         chapter 4



employees engaged by tnt express are to be regarded as tnt express own unregistered employees
as a result tnt express could incur costs such as legal costs social security contributions wage taxes
and overtime payments in respect of such employees if these actions were successful operating
expenses would rise and this could affect profitability

tnt express operations are subject to risks related to climate change regulation which could
affect its revenues and profitability
global concern about climate change could lead to governmental actions or regulations that require tnt
express to reduce co2 emissions by its air and road fleet for example many local governments are
imposing regulations to limit both the volume of road traffic and emissions in city centres such action or
regulation could affect tnt express air and road transport as well as those of its subcontractors in
addition since 1 january 2012 tnt airways nvsa has been subject to the requirements and
obligations of the eu emissions trading scheme these measures could affect tnt express revenues
and profitability

employee subcontractor and supplier misconduct could result in financial losses loss of clients
and fines or other sanctions imposed by the national and local governments and other
regulators of the countries in which tnt express does business
tnt express has implemented a robust integrity programme intended to protect it against risks relating
to fraud and other improper activities however notwithstanding its integrity programme tnt express
may be unable in all cases to prevent its employees from engaging in misconduct fraud or other
improper activities that could adversely affect tnt express business and reputation misconduct could
include the failure to comply with applicable laws or tnt express business principles a breach of
confidentiality or breach of contract with clients as a result of employee misconduct tnt express
could incur fines and penalties imposed by governments in the countries in which it does business
furthermore tnt express customers could file claims andor terminate the contract for breach thereof
any such fines penalties or claims could depending on their magnitude lead to adjustments to the
financial statements and result in liabilities that could reduce profitability in addition negative publicity in
relation to employee misconduct could negatively affect tnt express reputation harm its ability to
recruit employees and managers and reduce revenues

similar risks apply with regard to misconduct by tnt express subcontractors and suppliers in recent
years courts and regulators have increasingly held companies liable for acts of their independent
subcontractors and suppliers in view of this trend tnt express has among other things communicated
the tnt express business principles to its subcontractors and suppliers and provides training to ensure
compliance however notwithstanding such communication and training activities tnt express may
nevertheless experience potential liabilities in connection with its subcontractors and suppliers activities
under certain circumstances if those subcontractors and suppliers engage in conduct in violation of the
tnt express business principles andor applicable laws

in addition the application of the integrity programme to certain subcontractors and suppliers may be
affected by the fact that in certain jurisdictions authorities have instituted actions against tnt express
alleging that subcontractors or their employees engaged by the company are to be regarded as tnt
express own unregistered employees

financial risks

specific  financial risks
tnt express targets a bbbbaa1 credit rating lower ratings may increase financing costs and
harm its ability to finance operations and acquisitions which could negatively affect revenues
and profitability
there is no certainty that tnt express can maintain or recover its targeted credit rating of bbb sp 
baa1 moodys tnt express current credit ratings are bbb stable and baa2 negative a downgrade
of one or both of tnt express credit ratings may increase tnt express financing costs and harm the
companys ability to finance its operations and other major outlays which could affect revenues and
profitability

a breakup or a change in the composition of the eurozone and its currency could negatively
affect tnt express ability to finance its operations and negatively impact its financial
exposures
a breakup of or change in the composition of the eurozone and its currency could have a significant
impact on business performance among others due to the adverse macroeconomic impact such a
breakup may cause in addition a breakup or change could result in a significant devaluation of assets
and profits due to currency devaluations also it could restrict the free transfer of money and currencies
and may adversely affect the creditworthiness of our counterparts

currency and interest rate fluctuations could affect tnt express revenues and profitability
tnt express operates and sells its services globally and a substantial portion of its assets liabilities
costs sales and income are denominated in currencies other than the euro tnt express reporting
currency the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the euro may fluctuate in addition a
portion of tnt express borrowings and financial assets incur floating interest rates the main
sensitivities on revenues and costs can be derived from geographical segmentation as provided in the
additional notes to the financial statements presented in chapter 5

although tnt express generally enters into hedging arrangements and other contracts in order to
reduce its exposure to currency and interest fluctuations these measures may be inadequate or may
subject it to increased operating or financing costs affecting profitability

there are no net investment hedges outstanding however significant acquisitions and local debts are
usually funded in the currency of the underlying assets such local debt may be structured via local bank
loans or via intercompany loans in the latter case the foreign exchange risk on the intercompany loan
is hedged with a bank which effectively results in the equivalent of local currency bank debt these
debts in local currency form a natural hedge against part of the foreign currency cash flow earnings
risks and translation exposures as a result fluctuations of local currency foreign exchange rates versus
euro and fluctuations in local currency interest rates may affect tnt express revenues profitability and
equity refer to notes 29 and 30 of the consolidated financial statements

tnt express income tax liability may substantially increase if the tax laws and regulations in
countries in which it operates change or become subject to adverse interpretations or become
inconsistent
taxes payable by companies in many of the countries in which tnt express operates include taxes on
profit valueadded tax payrollrelated taxes property taxes and other taxes tax laws and regulations
in some of these countries may be subject to frequent change varying interpretation and inconsistent
enforcement ineffective tax collection systems and continuing budget requirements may increase the
likelihood of the imposition of arbitrary or onerous taxes and penalties which could have a material
adverse effect on tnt express financial condition and results of operations in addition to the usual tax
burden imposed on taxpayers these conditions create uncertainty as to the tax implications of various
business decisions this uncertainty could expose tnt express to fines and penalties and to
enforcement measures despite its best efforts at compliance and could result in a greater than
expected tax burden

in addition many of the jurisdictions in which tnt express operates have adopted transfer pricing
legislation if tax authorities impose significant additional tax liabilities as a result of transfer pricing
adjustments this could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations
and may lead to double taxation it is also possible that tax authorities in the countries in which tnt
express operates will introduce additional revenue raising measures the introduction of any such
provisions may affect its overall tax efficiency and may result in significant additional taxes becoming
payable any such additional tax exposure could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition
and results of operations tnt express may also face a significant increase in its income taxes if tax
rates increase or the tax laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates or treaties between
those jurisdictions are modified in an adverse manner this may adversely affect its cash flows liquidity
and ability to pay dividends

if profitability were to be reduced tnt express might be unable to fully utilise its deferred tax
assets
as at 31 december 2011 tnt express had 244 million recorded as net deferred tax assets in its
consolidated financial statements see note 22 of the consolidated financial statements these assets
can be utilised only if and only to the extent that its operating subsidiaries generate adequate levels of
taxable income in future periods to offset the tax loss carryforwards and reverse the temporary
differences prior to expiration at 31 december 2011 the amount of future income required to recover
tnt express deferred tax assets was approximately 900 million over a period of at least ten years at
certain operating subsidiaries

tnt express ability to generate taxable income is subject to general economic financial competitive
legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control if tnt express generates lower
taxable income than the amount it has assumed in determining its deferred tax assets then the value of
its deferred tax assets will be reduced

tnt express insurance policy includes a retention clause and may not cover all damages which
could affect profitability
tnt express is insured via an inhouse captive insurance company for catastrophic risks under
insurance covers that are in line with market practice the insurance policy includes a retention own
risk clause the insurance policy may not cover all potential damages as the coverage is limited both in




                                                                                                           69

                                                                                                     chapter 4



the size of insured amounts as well as in the nature of the damage claims in case of damages and or
proven negligence these might not be fully covered which could affect tnt express profitability

risks relating to securities of tnt express

tnt express will not have recourse on another party for these payments except to the extent it has
recourse on postnl

material owners of tnt express nv ordinary shares postdemerger could be in a position to
exercise proportionate but still significant influence this could affect the trading volume and
market price of the ordinary shares

material holdings given the historical attendance rates of general meetings of dutch listed companies
this allows postnl and other material investors the ability to exercise proportionate but still significant
influence over certain corporate matters requiring approval of a general meeting of shareholders
subject to the relationship agreement as described in section 153 of the prospectus tnt express
nv first admission to trading and listing document in the case of postnl this concentration of
ownership could affect the trading volume and market price of the ordinary shares

the international accounting standards board iasb has issued certain international financial
reporting standards or amendments thereon and the ifric has issued certain interpretations the
impact of changes when adopted by the eu on tnt express consolidated financial statements has
been assessed

basis of preparation 2010
in preparing the 2010 combined financial statements the financial information of the legal entities within
tnt express were extracted from the reporting records on a legal entity basis the accounting policies
in the 2010 combined financial statements for tnt express were consistent with the accounting policies
applied in tnt nvs 2010 consolidated financial statements which comply with ifrs as adopted by
the eu as a result the combined financial statements were based on predecessor values and included
all entities that were within reporting entity scope of tnt express

the combined financial statements were prepared on a carveout basis from the tnt nv
consolidated financial statements for the purposes of presenting the financial position results of
operations and cash flows of tnt express on a standalone basis the combined financial statements
of tnt express reflect assets liabilities revenues and expenses directly attributable to tnt express
including management fee allocations recognised on a historical basis in the accounting records of tnt
nv on a legal entity basis although it is not possible to estimate the actual costs that would have been
incurred if the services performed by tnt nv were purchased from independent third parties the
allocations were considered to be reasonable by management of tnt express however the financial
position results of operations and cash flows of tnt express were not necessarily representative or
indicative of those that would have been achieved had tnt express operated autonomously or as an
entity independent from tnt nv

the 2010 combined financial statements form the basis for the preparation of the 2011 consolidated
financial statements

    interpretation clarifies the accounting by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are

    expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount
    rate to the net defined benefit liability asset tnt express is yet to assess the full impact of the
    amendments

   ifrs 9 financial instruments addresses the classification measurement and recognition of
    financial assets and financial liabilities ifrs 9 was issued in november 2009 and october 2010 it
    replaces the parts of ias 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial
    instruments ifrs 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories
    those measured at fair value and those measured at amortised cost the determination is made at
    initial recognition the classification depends on the entitys business model for managing its
    financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument for financial
    liabilities the standard retains most of the ias 39 requirements the main change is that in cases
    where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities the part of a fair value change due to an
    entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income

   ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements builds on existing principles by identifying the concept
    of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated
    financial statements of the parent company the standard provides additional guidance to assist in
    the determination of control where this is difficult to assess tnt express is yet to assess ifrs 10s

   ifrs 11 joint arrangements replaces ias 31 interests in joint ventures and deals with how a
    joint arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control should be classified under ifrs
    11 joint ventures are required to be accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereas
    under ias 31 jointly controlled entities can be accounted for using the equity method of accounting
    or proportionate accounting tnt express is yet to assess ifrs 11s full impact and intends to

   ifrs 13 fair value measurement aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by
    providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and
    disclosure requirements for use across ifrss the requirements which are largely aligned
    between ifrss and us gaap do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance
    on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within

consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include the financial numbers of tnt express nv and its
subsidiaries associates and joint ventures and have been prepared using uniform accounting policies
for similar transactions and other events in similar circumstances all significant intercompany
transactions balances and unrealised gains on transactions have been eliminated on consolidation
unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred a complete list of subsidiaries associates and joint ventures included in tnt express
consolidated financial statements is filed for public review at the chamber of commerce in amsterdam
this list has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of article 379 1 and article 414 of book 2
of the dutch civil code

as the financial statements of tnt express nv are included in the consolidated financial statements
the corporate income statement is presented in an abridged form article 402 of book 2 of the dutch
civil code

subsidiaries associates and joint ventures
subsidiaries are all entities including special purpose entities over which tnt express has the power
to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one
half of the voting rights the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable
or convertible are considered when assessing whether tnt express controls another entity




                                                                                                          79

                                                                                                      statements
                                                                                                       chapter 5




an associate is an entity that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture over which
commercial and financial policy decisions tnt express has the power to exert significant influence
significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the
entity but is not control or joint control over those policies tnt express share of results of all significant
associates is included in the consolidated financial statements of income using the equity method the
carrying value of tnt express share in associates includes goodwill on acquisition and includes
changes to reflect tnt express share in net earnings of the respective companies reduced by
dividends received tnt express share in nondistributed earnings of associates is included in net
investment when tnt express share of any accumulated losses exceeds the acquisition value of the
shares in the associates the book value is reduced to zero and the reporting of losses ceases unless
tnt express is bound by guarantees or other undertakings in relation to the associate

a joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby tnt express and one or more parties undertake
an economic activity that is subject to joint control joint ventures in which tnt express participates with
other parties are proportionately consolidated in applying the proportionate combination method tnt
express percentage share of the balance sheet and income statement items are included in tnt
express consolidated financial statements

business combinations
tnt express uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries
the consideration of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred equity
instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange the consideration
transferred includes also the fair value arising from contingent consideration arrangements acquisition
related costs are expensed as incurred identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition
date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest

the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of tnt express share of the identifiable
net assets of the subsidiary is recorded as goodwill if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of
tnt express share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised directly in
the income statement

tnt express treats transactions with noncontrolling interests as transactions with equity owners for
purchases from noncontrolling interests the difference between any consideration paid and the
relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity gains
or losses on disposals to noncontrolling interests are also recorded in equity

when tnt express ceases to have control or significant influence any retained interest in the entity is
remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss the fair
value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the retained interest as
an associate joint venture or financial asset in addition any amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if tnt express had directly
disposed of the related assets or liabilities this may mean that amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss

the noncontrolling interest is initially measured at the proportion of the noncontrolling interest in the
recognised net fair value of the assets liabilities and contingent liabilities losses applicable to the non
controlling interest in excess of its share of the subsidiarys equity are allocated against tnt express
interests except to the extent that the noncontrolling interest has a binding obligation and is able to
make an additional investment to cover the losses subsidiaries accounting policies have been changed
where necessary to ensure consistency with tnt express accounting policies

functional currency and presentation currency
items included in the financial statements of all tnt express entities are measured using the currency
of the primary environment in which the entity operates the functional currency the consolidated
financial statements are presented in euros which is the functional and presentation currency of tnt
express

foreign currency transactions and balances
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the date of the transactions monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are
translated to the functional currency using yearend exchange rates




                                                                                                             80

                                                                                                  statements
                                                                                                   chapter 5



foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency
transactions and balances and from the translation at yearend exchange rates are recognised in the
income statement except for qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges that are
directly recognised in equity

foreign operations
the results and financial position of all tnt express entities none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows
 assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate
 income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates and
 the resulting exchange differences based on the different ways of translation between the balance
     sheet and the income statement are recognised as a separate component of equity translation
     reserve

foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign
entities and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments
are taken to the translation reserve when a foreign operation is sold such exchange differences are
recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on the sale

goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing exchange rate

intangible assets

goodwill
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the share of the
identifiable net assets acquired by tnt express goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and joint
ventures is included in intangible assets goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in
investments in associates

goodwill is recognised as an asset and although it is not amortised it is reviewed for impairment
annually and whenever there is a possible indicator of impairment any impairment is recognised
immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed goodwill is carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses on disposal of an entity any residual amount of goodwill is included in
the determination of the profit or loss on disposal

goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to ifrs has been retained at the previous
historical values as no adjustment was required on transition these have also been subject to
impairment tests at that date and will continue to be at least annually

other intangible assets
costs related to the development and installation of software for internal use are capitalised at historical
cost and amortised over the estimated useful life apart from software other intangible assets mainly
include customer relationships assets under development licences and concessions other intangible
assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date

an asset under development is transferred to its respective intangible asset category at the moment it is
ready for use and is amortised using the straightline method over its estimated useful life other
intangible assets are valued at the lower of historical cost less amortisation and impairment

property plant and equipment
property plant and equipment are valued at historical cost using a component approach less
depreciation and impairment losses in addition to the costs of acquisition the company also includes
costs of bringing the asset to working condition handling and installation costs and the nonrefundable
purchase taxes under the component approach each component of an item of property plant and
equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item shall be depreciated
separately

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method based on the estimated useful life taking into
account any residual value the assets residual value and useful life is reviewed and adjusted if
appropriate at each balance sheet date subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount
or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably




                                                                                                         81

                                                                                                   statements
                                                                                                    chapter 5




land is not depreciated system software is capitalised and amortised as a part of the tangible fixed
asset for which it was acquired to operate because the estimated useful life is inextricably linked to the
estimated useful life of the associated asset

leases of property plant and equipment are classified as finance leases if the company has
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership finance leases are capitalised at the leases
inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum
lease payments the corresponding rental obligations net of finance charges are included in longterm
debt property plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of
the assets useful life and the lease term

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment

goodwill
goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an
indication that the asset might be impaired

for the purposes of assessing impairment assets are grouped by cash generating unit the lowest level
at which there are separately identifiable cash flows for impairment testing of goodwill the cash
generating unit is defined as the lowest level where goodwill is monitored for internal purposes this
level may be higher than the level used for testing other assets but is not at a higher level than an
operating segment

if the recoverable value of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount the impairment loss
is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other
assets of the unit prorata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit the recoverable
amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use in assessing the value in use the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the asset specific risks for the
purpose of assessing impairment corporate assets are allocated to specific cash generating units
before impairment testing the allocation of the corporate assets is based on the contribution of those
assets to the future cash flows of the cash generating unit under review goodwill following the
acquisition of associates is not separately recognised or tested for impairment

impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in a subsequent period

finite lived intangible assets and property plant and equipment
at each balance sheet date tnt express reviews the carrying amount of its finite lived intangible assets
and property plant and equipment to determine whether there is an indication that those assets have
suffered an impairment loss if any indication exists the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated
in order to determine the extent if any of the impairment loss an asset is impaired if the recoverable
amount is lower than the carrying value the recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an assets
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use

if the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying
amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount any impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the income statement impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed
only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount
since the last impairment loss was recognised the recoverable amount shall not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years a
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement

financial assets and liabilities
tnt express classifies financial assets and liabilities into the following categories financial assets and
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss loans and receivables heldtomaturity investments
availableforsale financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost the classification
depends on the purpose for which the financial asset or liability was acquired management determines
the classification of tnt express financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition

financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include derivatives and other
assets and liabilities that are designated as such upon initial recognition

measurement at fair value requires disclosure of measurement methods by level of the following fair
value measurement hierarchy




                                                                                                          82

                                                                                                      statements
                                                                                                       chapter 5



level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets
level 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly prices or indirectly derived
from prices
level 3 inputs not based on observable market data

financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are initially recorded at fair
value and subsequently remeasured at fair value on the balance sheet tnt express designates certain
derivatives as hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities of a firm commitment fair
value hedge hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecasted transaction cash flow hedge or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
net investment hedge

if a derivative is designated as a cash flow or net investment hedge changes in its fair value are
considered to be effective and recorded in a separate component in equity until the hedged item is
recorded in income any portion of a change in the fair value of a derivative that is considered to be
ineffective or is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness is immediately recorded in the income
statement

at the inception of the transaction tnt express documents the relationship between hedging
instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions the company also documents the assessment both at hedge inception and
on an ongoing basis of whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items

changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are
recorded in the income statement together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or
liability that are attributable to the hedged risk

amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged
item will affect profit and loss for example when the forecasted sale that is hedged takes place
however when the forecasted transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a nonfinancial
asset the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the
initial measurement of the asset or liability

when a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting any cumulative gains or losses existing in equity at that time remain in equity until the
forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement when a forecasted transaction
is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gains or losses that were reported in equity are
immediately transferred to the income statement

loans granted and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market and for which tnt express has no intention of trading loans
and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet except for maturities
greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date these are classified as noncurrent assets

heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
and fixed maturities where tnt express has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity

availableforsale financial assets are nonderivative financial assets that are either designated in this
category or not classified in any of the other categories of the fair value measurement hierarchy they
are included in noncurrent assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12
months at the balance sheet date availableforsale financial assets are carried at fair value

loans and receivables and heldtomaturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest method unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets
and liabilities classified at fair value through profit and loss are directly recorded in the income
statement

unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets classified as
availableforsale are recognised in other comprehensive income when financial assets classified as
availableforsale are sold or impaired the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the
consolidated income statement as a gain or a loss

the fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices if the market for a financial asset
is not active and for unlisted securities tnt express establishes fair value by using valuation
techniques these include the use of recent arms length transactions reference to other instruments




                                                                                                             83

                                                                                                    statements
                                                                                                     chapter 5



that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis refined to reflect the issuers specific
circumstances

tnt express assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired in the case of equity securities classified as available
forsale a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in
determining whether the securities are impaired if any such evidence exists for availableforsale
financial assets the cumulative loss  measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the
current fair value less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in income
statement  is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement impairment losses on
equity instruments recognised in the income statement are not reversed through equity

financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction
costs incurred and are subsequently stated at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net
of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of
the financial liability using the effective interest method

inventory
inventories of raw materials and finished goods are valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable
value historical cost is based on weighted average prices

accounts receivable
accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method less allowance for impairment an allowance for impairment of
accounts receivable is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables the amount of the allowance
is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
flows discounted at the effective interest rate the amount of the loss is recognised in the income
statement any reversal of the impairment loss is included in the income statement at the same line as
where the original expense has been recorded

the risk of uncollectibility of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with
and the past due status of doubtful debtors while large accounts are assessed individually based on
factors that include ability to pay bankruptcy and payment history in addition debtors in certain
countries are subject to a higher collectability risk which is taken into account when assessing the
overall risk of uncollectability the assumptions and estimates applied for determining the valuation
allowance are reviewed periodically

cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at fair value cash and cash equivalents
include cash at hand bank account balances bills of exchange and cheques only those which can be
cashed in the short term all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less
at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents bank overdrafts are not netted off from cash
and cash equivalents

assets or disposal groups classified as held for disposal and discontinued
operations
assets or disposal groups are classified as assets held for disposal and stated at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is recovered principally by
means of disposal rather than through continuing use assets held for disposal are no longer amortised
or depreciated from the time they are classified as such

operations that represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or that
are part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical
area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale and either have been
disposed of or have been classified as held for disposal are presented as discontinued operations in
tnt express income statement

assets classified as held for disposal are available for immediate disposal in its present condition and
are considered as highly probable

equity
ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds




                                                                                                           84

                                                                                                    chapter 5




where any group company purchases tnt express equity share capital treasury shares the
consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is
deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled reissued or disposed of where such shares are
subsequently sold or reissued any consideration received net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects are included in equity

provisions for pension liabilities
the obligation for all pension and other postemployment plans that qualify as defined benefit plans is
determined by calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and deducting the fair value
of the plan assets tnt express uses actuarial calculations projected unit credit method to measure
the obligations and the costs for the calculations actuarial assumptions are made about demographic
variables such as employee turnover and mortality and financial variables such as the expected long
term return on plan assets the discount rate is determined by reference to market rates

cumulative actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the balance sheet the portion of the
cumulative actuarial gains and losses that exceed the higher of 10 of the obligation or 10 of the fair
value of plan assets corridor approach are recognised in the income statement over the employees
expected average remaining service years

past service costs if any are recognised on a straightline basis over the average vesting period of the
amended pension or early retirement benefits certain past service costs may be recognised
immediately if the benefits vest immediately

gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised at the date of
the curtailment or settlement

pension costs for defined contribution plans are expensed in the income statement when incurred or
due

other provisions
provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event it is probable
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation provisions are measured at the present
value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the
balance sheet date the discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability the gross up of the
provision following the discounting of the provision is recorded in the profit and loss statement as
interest expense

provisions are recorded for employee benefit obligations restructuring onerous contracts and other
obligations

the provision for employee benefit obligations includes longservice leave or sabbatical leave jubilee or
other longservice benefits longterm disability benefits and if they are not payable wholly within twelve
months after the end of the period profit sharing bonuses and deferred compensation the expected
costs of these benefits are recognised over the period of employment actuarial gains and losses and
changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to income in the period such gain or loss
occurs related service costs are recognised immediately

the provision recorded for restructuring largely relates to termination benefits termination benefits are
payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits tnt express recognises termination
benefits when the company has committed to terminate the employment of current employees according
to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or provide termination benefits as a result of an
offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy benefits falling due more than 12 months after balance
sheet date are discounted to their present value

provisions for onerous contracts are recorded when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation
under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to arise from that contract taking into
account impairment of fixed assets first

the provision for other obligations relates to legal and contractual obligations and received claims




                                                                                                          85

trade accounts payable
trade accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method

income taxes
the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive
income

the amount of income tax included in the income statement is determined in accordance with the rules
established by the taxation authorities based on which income taxes are payable or recoverable

deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and the tax base of assets and liabilities are calculated using the substantively
enacted tax rates expected to apply when they are realised or settled deferred tax assets are
recognised if it is probable that they will be realised deferred tax assets and liabilities where a legally
enforceable right to offset exists and within the same tax group are presented net in the balance sheet

revenue recognition
revenues are recognised when services are rendered goods are delivered or work is completed
revenue is the gross inflow of economic benefits during the current year that arise from ordinary
activities and result in an increase in equity other than increases relating to contributions from equity
participants

revenues of delivered goods and services are recognised when
 the company has transferred to a buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
   and services
 the company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
   with ownership nor effective control of the goods and services sold
 the amounts of revenue are measured reliably
 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the company
 the costs to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and
 the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably

revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration of received amounts or receivable amounts

amounts received in advance are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are rendered to
customers or goods are delivered

net sales
net sales represent the revenues from the delivery of goods and services to third parties less discounts
credit notes and taxes levied on sales accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the
discounts and returns

other operating revenues
other operating revenues relate to the sale of goods and rendering of services not related to the normal
trading activities of tnt express and mainly include sale of passengercharter revenue custom
clearance income and administration fees

other income
other income includes net gains or losses from the sale of property plant and equipment and other
gains and losses costs are recognised on the historical cost convention and are allocated to the
reporting year to which they relate

operating expenses
operating expenses represent the direct and indirect expenses attributable to sales including cost of
materials cost of work contracted out and other external expenses personnel expenses directly related
to operations and depreciation amortisation and impairment charges

salaries
salaries wages and social security costs are charged to the profit and loss account when due in
accordance with employment contracts and obligations




                                                                                                         86

                                                                                                  chapter 5



profitsharing and bonus plans
tnt express recognises a liability and an expense for cashsettled bonuses and profitsharing when the
company has a legal or constructive obligation to make such payments as a result of past performance
and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made based on a formula that takes into consideration
the profit attributable after normalisation for certain oneoff items

sharebased payments
prior to demerger tnt nv had equitysettled sharebased compensation plans including those of tnt
express employees sharebased payment transactions are transactions in which tnt express
receives benefits from its employees in consideration for equity instruments or for amounts of cash that
are based on the price of equity instruments of the company the fair value of the equitysettled share
based transactions is recognised as an expense part of the employee costs and a corresponding
increase in equity over the vesting period the fair value of sharebased payments under the companys
performance share plan is calculated using the monte carlo model the equity instruments granted do
not vest until the employee completes a specific period of service

due to the demerger all these plans were terminated and settled prior to the demerger this settlement
was accounted for as an accelerated vesting which resulted in expense recognition of the remaining
grant date fair value

in 2011 after the demerger a new sharebased payment plan matching plan was introduced by tnt
express nv which will be cashsettled upon vesting the fair value of cashsettled sharebased
payment transactions is measured at each reporting date and at settlement the fair value is recognised
as an expense part of the employee costs and a corresponding increase in liabilities over the vesting
period

interest income and expense
interest income and expense are recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest
method interest income comprises interest income on borrowings changes in the fair value of financial
assets at fair value through profit or loss foreign currency gains and gains on hedged items interest
expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings unwinding of the discount on provisions foreign
currency losses changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
impairment losses recognised on financial assets and losses on hedged items

all borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method except to the
extent that they can be capitalised as cost of a qualifying asset

grants
grants are recognised initially as income when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received
and tnt express has complied with the conditions associated with the grant grants that compensate
tnt express for expenses incurred are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis in the
same period in which the expenses are recognised grants that compensate tnt express for the cost
of an asset are deducted from the historical value of the asset and recognised in the income statement
on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset

operating leases
leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
operating leases payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the
lessor are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the period of the lease

dividend distribution
dividend distribution to tnt express shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements
in the year in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders if tnt express offers its
shareholders dividends in additional shares the additionally issued shares are recognised at their
nominal amount




                                                                                                        87

                                                                                                 statements
                                                                                                  chapter 5



consolidated statement of cash flows
the consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method cash flows in foreign
currencies are translated at average exchange rates exchange rate differences affecting cash items are
shown separately in the statement of cash flows receipts and payments with respect to taxation on
profits are included in cash flows from operating activities interest payments are included in cash flows
from operating activities while interest receipts are included in cash flows from investing activities the
cost of acquisition of subsidiaries associates and investments insofar as it was paid for in cash is
included in cash flows from investing activities acquisitions of subsidiaries are presented net of cash
balances acquired cash flows from derivatives are recognised in the statement of cash flows in the
same category as those of the hedged item

segment reporting
operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decisionmakers the chief operating decisionmakers who are responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments have been identified as the executive
board of tnt express which makes strategic decisions the executive board receives operational and
financial information on a monthly basis for europe  mea asia pacific americas and other networks
for comparison purposes the 2010 segment information has been revised accordingly

critical accounting estimates and judgments in applying tnt express
accounting policies
the preparation of the financial statements of tnt express requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of tnt express financial statements
estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances

tnt express makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future the resulting accounting
estimates will by definition seldom equal the related actual results the estimates and assumptions that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year are discussed below

business combinations
tnt express accounts for all its business combinations applying the acquisition method the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised and measured on the basis of their fair values at the
date of acquisition to determine fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed tnt express
must make estimates and use valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available any
excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired represents
goodwill

for purposes of preparation of the consolidated financial statements internal reorganisations or transfer
of businesses between tnt express companies were accounted for at predecessor carrying amounts
these transactions did not give rise to goodwill

impairment of assets
in determining impairments of intangible assets including goodwill tangible fixed assets and financial
fixed assets management must make significant judgments and estimates to determine whether the fair
value of the cash flows generated by those assets is less than their carrying value determining cash
flows requires the use of judgments and estimates that have been included in the strategic plans and
longrange forecasts of tnt express the data necessary for executing the impairment tests are based
on management estimates of future cash flows which require estimating revenue growth rates and profit
margins for applied sensitivities on intangible assets see note 1

depreciation and amortisation of tangible and intangible fixed assets
tangible and intangible fixed assets except for goodwill are depreciated or amortised at historical cost
using a straightline method based on the estimated useful life taking into account any residual value
the assets residual value and useful life are based on tnt express best estimates and reviewed and
adjusted if required at each balance sheet date

impairment of receivables
the risk of uncollectability of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with
and the past due status of doubtful debtors while large accounts are individually assessed based on




                                                                                                        88

                                                                                                    statements
                                                                                                     chapter 5



factors that include ability to pay bankruptcy and payment history in addition debtors in certain
countries are subject to a higher collectability risk which is taken into account when assessing the
overall risk of uncollectability should the outcome differ from the assumptions and estimates revisions
to the estimated valuation allowances would be required

restructuring
restructuring charges mainly result from restructuring operations including combinations andor
relocations of operations changes in tnt express strategic direction or managerial responses to
declining demand increasing costs or other market factors restructuring provisions reflect many
estimates including those pertaining to separation costs reduction of excess facilities contract
settlements and tangible asset impairments actual experience has been and may continue to be
different from these estimates

income taxes
the company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions significant judgment is required in
determining the worldwide provision and liability for income taxes there are many transactions and
calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business
tnt express recognises liabilities for tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be
due based on its best interpretation of the relevant tax laws and rules where the final tax outcome of
these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will impact the
income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made

tnt express recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits
will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered this is based on estimates of taxable income by
jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are
recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods and depending
on the tax strategies that the company may be able to implement changes to the recognition of deferred
tax assets could be required which could impact tnt express financial position and net profit

accounting for assets classified as held for disposal
accounting for assets classified as held for disposal requires the use of significant assumptions and
estimates such as the assumptions used in the fair value calculations as well as the estimated costs to
dispose

pension benefits
the present value of the pension obligation depends on a number of factors that are determined on an
actuarial basis using a number of assumptions any change in these assumptions will impact the
carrying amount of pension obligations the assumptions used in determining the net pension
expenseincome include the discount rate the discount rate is based on the longterm yield of high
quality corporate bonds other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current
market conditions tnt express reviews the assumptions at the end of each year additional information
is disclosed in note 10

contingent liabilities
legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending against the company in various jurisdictions
due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters it is often difficult to predict the final outcome the cases
and claims against the company often raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues that are
subject to many uncertainties and complexities including but not limited to the facts and circumstances
of each particular case and claim the jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law in the normal
course of business tnt express consults with legal counsel and certain other experts on matters
related to litigations

tnt express accrues a liability when it is determined that an adverse outcome is probable and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event an adverse outcome is possible or an
estimate is not determinable the matter is disclosed

basis of combination 2010
in determining the entities included in the 2010 combined financial statements management considered
those entities that were managed as part of tnt express on a historical basis

net investment
the net investment at 31 december 2010 by other tnt nv companies included the aggregated
combined share capital of the entities included within the combined financial statements capital




                                                                                                           89

                                                                                                    statements
                                                                                                     chapter 5



contributions and reductions dividend payments and other movements relating to tnt nv investments
not managed as part of the tnt express business accumulated results cumulative translation
adjustments and cash flow hedging

management fee
tnt nv used a cost recovery mechanism to recover certain central management and other similar
costs it incurred at a corporate level the management fees reflected in the 2010 combined financial
statements were based on the amounts historically due and were recorded in the accounts of the
individual legal entities within tnt express under the contractual cost recovery mechanism an
appropriate proportion of the remuneration of personnel for tnt nv and tnt express including their
salaries and pension costs was included in these management fees these management fees were
either directly attributed to individual operations of tnt express or for costs incurred centrally allocated
between the relevant tnt nv businesses and tnt express operations on arms length basis

pension and post retirement costs
in 2010 tnt express operated a number of pension plans around the world which include defined
benefit plans in the netherlands the united kingdom germany australia and italy the dutch pension
plans were funded defined benefit plans covered by pension funds externally funded in stichting
pensioenfonds tnt and stichting ondernemingspensioenfonds tnt tnt nv was the sponsoring
employer for these two dutch pension plans and consequently these pension plans qualify as group
plans for tnt express in accordance with ias 1934a due to their qualification as group plans tnt
express recognised in the 2010 combined financial statement a cost equal to the contribution payable
for the period

interest
the interest charge reflected in the 2010 combined financial statements were based on the interest
charge historically incurred by the entities included in tnt express on specific external borrowings or
financing provided by other tnt nv companies

taxation
the tax charge attributable to tnt express was based on the tax charge in 2010 attributable to the
individual entity or group of tnt nv entities in the relevant individual tax jurisdictions on a separate
return basis

goodwill
goodwill recorded at a consolidated tnt nv level and attributable to tnt express as a result of
previous business combinations with parties outside of the tnt nv group of companies were recorded
in the 2010 combined financial statements

sharebased payments
a number of tnt express employees participated in tnt nvs performance share schemes for
purposes of the 2010 combined financial statements transfers of tnt nvs equity instruments to
employees of tnt express were recognised as equitysettled sharebased payment transactions




                                                                                                           90

goodwill
goodwill is allocated to tnt express cash generating units cgus and tested for impairment the
cgus correspond to operations in a region and the nature of the services that are provided and include
northern europe southern europe  mea asia pacific north america south america and other
networks

in 2011 the goodwill impairment of 209 million is related to the south america operations as a result of
revenue losses and performance pressure the addition of 3 million is related to southern europe 
mea whereby a settlement of 3 million was received in 2011 related to the purchase price of tg plus
transcamer gomez sau as this company was acquired in 2006 this settlement was accounted for
against goodwill in accordance with ifrs 3 2004 the exchange rate differences favourably impact the
goodwill of northern europe by 1 million and asia pacific by 6 million while decreasing the value of
south america by 15 million

total goodwill balance at 31 december 2011 amounted to 1483 million 2010 1703 which is
allocated to northern europe for 659 million 2010 658 southern europe  mea for 571 million
2010 574 asia pacific for 168 million 2010 162 north america for 0 million 2010 0 south
america for 27 million 2010 251 and other networks for 58 million 2010 58

in 2010 the additions to goodwill of 13 million are the result of the finalisation of the purchase price
allocation of the 2009 acquisitions of expresso araçatuba 5 million and lit cargo 8 million
exchange rate differences resulted in an increase of goodwill by 44 million for acquisitions in brazil
chile and china due to the strengthening of the relating currencies compared to the euro

based on the 2011 financial performance a detailed review has been performed of the recoverable
amount of each cgu the recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and fair value less cost




                                                                                                        91

to sell fair value less cost to sell represents the best estimate of the amount tnt express would
receive if it were to sell the cgu the fair value was estimated on basis of the present value of future
cash flows taking into account cost to sell

for mature markets the estimated future net cash flows are based on a fiveyear forecast and business
plan for emerging markets where no steady state has been achieved to date a tenyear forecast has
been applied to estimate the future net cash flows the applied growth rate does not exceed the long
term average growth rate of the related operations and markets the cash flow projections based on
financial budgets have been approved by management

tnt express determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations
for market development the weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts
included in industry reports the discount rates used in the cgus valuations vary from 10 to 16 pre
tax posttax 8 to 12 to reflect specific risks relating to each cgu

key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values of all cgus are
 maturity of the underlying market market share and volume development to determine the revenue
    mix and growth rate
 level of capital expenditure in network related assets that may affect the further rollout of the
    network
 level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development taking into account
    the nature of the underlying costs and potential economies of scale and
 discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency
    and inflation related risks

management has carried out an impairment test and concluded that the recoverable amount based on
value in use of the individual cgus is higher than the carrying amount with the exception of south
america a sensitivity analysis has been applied for all cgus this sensitivity analysis included the
individual impact of the following items which are considered to be the most critical when determining
the recoverable value
 increase of the discount factor by 1 and 2
 increase of capital expenditure of 5 per year and
 decrease of operating income of 5 per year

at 31 december 2011 the impairment test based on the latest forecast with a forecast period of ten
years revealed that the carrying amount of cgu south america exceeds the recoverable value by 209
million goodwill impairment of 209 million is recorded and consequently there is no headroom
available in cgu south america cgu south americas operations are mainly in brazil and chile
brazils 2011 results have been negatively impacted by revenue losses and performance pressure the
negative performance is being addressed through a full range of corrective measures

compared to the impairment test of 2010 the headroom for cgu southern europe  mea has reduced
from around 700 million to around 400 million as a reflection of the general macroeconomic
environment in that region the result of the sensitivity analysis for this cgu at an increase of the
discount factor by 2 would reduce such headroom further to around 40 million

software and other intangible assets
at 31 december 2011 the software balance of 123 million 2010 127 included internally generated
software with a book value of 102 million 2010 103 the addition to software of 14 million related to
selfproduced software of 8 million and 6 million of purchased software the reclassification of 43
million to selfproduced software related to finalised it projects in 2011 software impairment of 16
million related to software development projects that are no longer deemed viable

at 31 december 2011 other intangible assets of 23 million 2010 62 related to customer relationships
of 8 million 2010 28 and software under construction of 15 million 2010 34 in 2011 the
impairment of 15 million related to customer relationships in south america as a result of loss of
customers the addition of 24 million related to software under construction

in 2010 the reduction of 23 million in other intangibles was due to adjustments to the fair values of
brand name of 6 million and customer relationships of 17 million this was the result of the finalisation
of the purchase price allocation of expresso araçatuba and lit cargo

the estimated amortisation expenses for software and other intangibles for the subsequent five years
are 2012 43 million 2013 34 million 2014 25 million 2015 14 million 2016 11 million and
thereafter 19 million besides software development tnt express does not conduct significant
research and development and therefore does not incur research and development costs

defined benefit plans in italy
in italy in accordance with italian law employers have to pay to employees upon the termination of
employment a lump sum indemnity trattamento di fine rapporto tfr equivalent to the total
annually revalued benefits accrued over the years of service until 31 december 2006 this was an
unfunded defined benefit plan whereby employers were obliged to accrue for this termination benefit
starting from 1 january 2007 due to legislation change tfr is no longer accrued by the employer but
by external providers mainly the national social security institute employers contribute to the fund the
equivalent of the accrued tfr therefore the tfr liability for tnt express consists of the unfunded
benefits accrued up to 31 december 2006 and of the obligation reflecting the annual revaluation of
these accrued benefits

at 31 december 2011 the defined benefit plans described above covers approximately 98 of the tnt
express group obligation for postemployment benefits and approximately 99 of the tnt express
group plan assets

defined benefit pension costs recognised in the income statement
the valuation of the pension obligation of tnt express and the determination of its pension cost are
based on key assumptions that include employee turnover mortality rates and retirement ages discount
rates expected longterm returns on plan assets pension increases and future wage increases which
are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each financial year actual circumstances may vary
from these assumptions giving rise to a different pension liability at yearend the difference between
the projected pension liability based on the assumptions and the actual pension liability at yearend are
reflected in the balance sheet as part of the actuarial gains and losses if the cumulative actuarial gains
and losses exceed the corridor the excess will be amortised over the employees expected average
remaining service lives and reflected as an additional profit or expense in tnt express income
statement in the next year

in 2011 the settlement in benefit obligation and plan assets is as a result of the new separate execution
agreements with the dutch pension funds with regards to the allocated tnt express employees as a
consequence of the demerger this results in a oneoff settlement gain of 16 million

tnt express pension expense is affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations
and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets management reviews these and other
assumptions every year measurement date for tnt express postemployment benefits is 31
december changes in assumptions may occur as a result of economic and market conditions if actual
results differ from those assumed this will generate actuarial gains or losses these are amortised over
the employees expected average remaining service lives if they exceed the corridor

the discount rate is based on the longterm yield on high quality corporate bonds management
considers various factors to determine the expected return on plan assets the expected return is based
on the current longterm rates of return on bonds and applies to these rates a suitable risk premium for
the different asset components the premium is based on the plans asset mix historical market returns
and current market expectation

assumptions regarding future mortality are based on advice published statistics and experience per
country the average life expectancy of men after retiring at the age of 65 is 20 years 2010 20 the
equivalent expectancy for women is 22 years 2010 22

no options or shares were granted to members of the supervisory board and none of the members of
the supervisory board accrued any pension rights with the company

specific equitybased remuneration issues related to the demerger
in 2011 due to the demerger specific measures were taken for senior management participating in the
various tnt nv equity compensation schemes predemerger all equity schemes of our former parent
tnt nv were unwound and post demerger a oneoff investmentmatching plan in tnt express nv
phantom equity was launched both are described below

unwinding of tnt nv equity schemes
the supervisory board of tnt nv decided that subject to approval of the demerger by the general
meeting of shareholders of tnt nv the unvested rights on performance shares in tnt nv and
granted matching shares in tnt nv as well as any unexercised options would be unwound before the
demerger

all schemes were terminated before the demerger so that no legacy plans existed thereafter the
eligible management consisted of the members of the board of management of tnt nv and senior
management

the unwinding of the tnt nv equity schemes has been executed as described below

the existing and unvested rights on performance shares and matching shares predemerger vested on
a prorata basis in accordance with plan rules and for the performance shares applying the most recent
performance criteria there was no vesting of performance shares since the realised total shareholder
return tsr compared to the incentive zone of the performance schedule did not allow for this

as the vesting period for the performance shares was terminated prematurely the supervisory board of
tnt nv decided in accordance with its discretionary power under the plan rules to apply a time value
based compensation in cash for prematurely terminated plans the calculation of the level of this
compensation was based on a generally accepted valuation model validated by independent external
parties




                                                                                                         106

                                                                                                    statements

the unwinding of the unvested performance shares and matching shares was settled in cash and paid
to the eligible management

the exercise period of the employee options for shares in tnt nv was shortened and ended before
the demerger the tnt nv supervisory board decided to compensate participants in cash for the loss
of the time value of the reduced options period the value of the options was calculated in accordance
with a generally accepted option valuation model validated by an independent external party and was
subsequently paid in cash to the eligible management

the accelerated vesting related to the unwinding of the equity schemes in place for tnt express
employees prior to the demerger was 14 million for tnt express the cash out amounted to 7 million
these amounts are accounted for in equity in accordance with ifrs 228b

oneoff investmentmatching plan
following the cashsettled unwinding of the tnt nv equity schemes no legacy plans remained to
stimulate shareownership and to align the interests of the members of the executive board and senior
management with shareholders the supervisory board of tnt nv decided to apply a voluntary oneoff
investmentmatching plan in which the cash proceeds from the unwinding of the tnt nv
bonusmatching plan performance share plan and option plan could  post demerger  be invested in
tnt express nv shares the participants could elect to invest from their net proceeds an amount equal
to 25 or 50 of their total gross unwindingrelated sum but not more than the net proceeds thereof in
tnt express nv shares on the same date these shares in the plan called investment shares were
purchased the participant received free of charge a matching right on phantom shares representing
the value in cash of half of the number of investment shares matching on a 1 05 basis this matching
right will vest and the cash value of the phantom shares comprising the matching right will be paid after
three years provided that the participant i has remained an employee throughout and ii still owns at
least 50 of hisher investment shares

if prior to vesting the participant sold more than half of hisher investment shares the matching right will
forfeit in full and if participant sold 50 or fewer of hisher investment shares the number of phantom
shares comprising the matching right will be reduced proportionally

bonusmatching plan in such case they are paid 100 of their bonus in cash and can convert 25 as
a grant of tnt express nv shares in the plan called bonus shares with an associated matching right
if at least 50 of the bonus shares is kept for three years

the company sees the bonusmatching plan as part of the remuneration package for the members of its
top management and it is particularly aimed at further aligning their interests with the interests of the
shareholders

supervisory board for 2011 the matching rights comprise phantom shares so that after three years the
rights under this plan will be settled in cash

the significant aspects of the plan are

    amount the matching right is granted upon the purchase of the bonus shares
 the number of bonus shares is calculated by dividing 25 of an individuals gross annual bonus
    relating to the preceding financial year by the share price on the euronext amsterdam on the date
    the grant is made 6 june 2011 947share
 the rights to phantom shares are granted for zero costs and the number of phantom shares is
    equal to the number of bonus shares matching on a 11 basis
 the value at vesting of the phantom shares is delivered in cash after a holding period of three years
    after the grant
 for each bonus share that is sold within three years the associated right to one matching phantom
    share lapses if more than 50 of the bonus shares is sold within three years the entire right to
    matching phantom shares lapses with immediate effect
 where a participant leaves the company for certain reasons retirement certain reorganisations
    disability or death the matching right will vest immediately and heshe receives cash on a prorata
    basis
 a participant loses the matching right with immediate effect in case heshe leaves the company for
    reasons other than those mentioned above

the noncash impact of depreciation amortisation impairments and sharebased payments this is 7
million lower than 2010 mainly due to lower operating results

the change in net pension liabilities of 31 million in 2011 2010 6 reflects the total tnt express
noncash employer pension expense for the postemployment defined benefit plans of 2 million 2010
7 including a settlement gain of 16 million as part of the demerger compared to the total tnt express
cash contributions to various postemployment defined benefit plans for a total amount of 33 million

same amount of interest received the amounts are not netted in the income statement because under
ifrs such offset needs in practice to be irreversibly exercised from time to time

on a gross basis while economically the 3 million of interest received 2010 3 is set off against the
23 million 2010 14 of interest paid on hedges interest paid to postnl of 6 million and interest
received from postnl of 5 million is also reported on a gross basis according to ifrs

29 june 2004 the liège court of appeal rejected the plaintiffs claims on the basis of a substantiated
legal reasoning the plaintiffs lodged an appeal with the belgian supreme court which overturned the
2004 judgment of the liège court of appeal on 4 december 2009 the matter has been sent to the
brussels court of appeal for new submissions and pleadings a new decision is not to be expected for
at least two to three years following a court of appeal session on 7 october 2010 a calendar of
proceedings was to be fixed however parties did not manage to come to an agreement on 21
december 2011 a hearing took place where the judge wished to assess whether all parties were validly

represented it appeared some of the plaintiffs no longer possessed legal representation a new hearing
will be scheduled with a fixed agenda

a similar claim was lodged on 5 may 2009 before the civil court of liège by the town of riemst which
is seeking the closure of liège airport the court rejected the claim on 14 april 2010 an appeal by
riemst was introduced on 14 september 2010 in which the town of riemst requested the court to
pronounce a temporary measure that will forbid the use of the extended runway an extension of 417
metres the court rejected the request on 12 october 2010 and fixed a calendar of proceedings tnt
express had to submit its conclusions before 1 march 2011 which were filed before the court on 30
september 2011 a hearing took place on 14 february 2012 where the matter was pleaded and
judgment can be expected around the end of april or the beginning of may it is unlikely that the
outcome of this proceeding will be different from the night flights case above

foreign investigations
the company has received and responded to subpoenas from the united states office of foreign asset
control and voluntarily disclosed to the united states bureau of industry and security inquiring about its
involvement in exports to countries sanctioned by the united states in addition the company has
received and responded to information requests from competition authorities in various jurisdictions and
cooperated with investigations in this context tnt express does not expect any liability arising from any
of those investigations to have a material effect on its results of operation liquidity capital resources or
financial position

29 financial risk management
no corresponding financial statement number

tnt express activities expose the company to a variety of financial risks such as market risks
including foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk all of these
risks arise in the normal course of business to manage market risks tnt express uses a variety of
financial derivatives

the following analyses provides quantitative information regarding tnt express exposure to the
financial risks described above there are certain limitations and simplifications inherent in the analyses
presented primarily due to the assumption that rates change in a parallel fashion and instantaneously
while at the same time for example the impact of changes in interest on foreign exchange exposures
and visa versa is ignored in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions
that normally would arise from the market shifts assumed

tnt express uses derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of hedging exposures the
company enters into contracts related to derivative financial instruments for periods commensurate with
its underlying exposures and does not take positions independent of these exposures none of these
financial instruments are leveraged or used for trading purposes or to take speculative positions

financial risk management is carried out by the treasury department under policies approved by the
executive board the treasury department identifies evaluates and hedges financial risk in close co
operation with operating units the executive board provides written principles for overall risk
management as well as written policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk interest
rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk periodic reporting on financial risks has been embedded in the
overall risk framework and has been provided to the executive board in a structural way

interest rate risk
part of tnt express borrowings and leases are against floating interest rates these floating interest
rates may fluctuate substantially and could have a material adverse effect on tnt express financial
results in any given reporting period borrowings that are issued at variable rates expose the company
to cash flow interest risks borrowings that are issued at fixed rates expose the company to fair value
interest rate risk tnt express financial assets are on average of such shortterm nature that they bear
no significant fair value but do cause cash flow interest rate risks group policy is to limit significantly
the impact of interest fluctuations over a term of seven years as a percentage of earnings before
interest taxes deprecation and amortisation at 31 december 2011 tnt express gross interest
bearing borrowings including finance lease obligations totalled 262 million 2010 358 of which 203
million 2010 307 was at a fixed interest rate

although tnt express generally enters into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivatives in
order to attempt to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations these measures may be inadequate
or may subject the company to increased operating or financing costs




                                                                                                            119

at 31 december 2011 if interest rates on borrowings and financial assets had been 1 higher with
other variables held constant the profit before income tax would have been 2 million higher 2010 7

foreign currency exchange risk
tnt express operates on an international basis generating foreign currency exchange risks arising from
future commercial transactions recognised assets and liabilities investments and divestments in foreign
currencies other than the euro tnt express functional and reporting currency tnt express treasury
department matches and manages the intragroup and external financial exposures although the
company generally enters into hedging arrangements and other contracts in order to reduce its
exposure to currency fluctuations these measures may be inadequate or may subject the company to
increased operating or financing costs

the two main currencies of tnt express external hedges are the british pound and us dollar of which
the 2011 exchange rates to the euro are shown below

management has set up a policy that requires group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk
against the functional currency group companies are required to hedge material balance sheet
exposures via the use of foreign exchange derivatives with the treasury department whereby a
financing company operated by the treasury department trades these foreign exchange derivatives with
external banks tnt express currently has no net investment hedges outstanding significant
acquisitions and local debt is usually funded in the currency of the underlying assets

credit risk
credit risk represents the loss that the company would incur if counterparties with whom tnt express
enters into financial transactions are unable to fulfil the terms of the agreements credit risk arises from
cash and cash equivalents derivatives and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as
credit exposures relating to customers the company attempts to minimise its credit risk exposure by
only transacting with financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines and by managing its
customers portfolio tnt express continually monitors the credit standing of financial counterparties
and its customers individual risk limits are set on internal and external ratings in accordance with limits
set by the executive board the utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored at reporting date there
were no significant concentrations of credit risk the top ten customers of tnt express account for 3
of the outstanding trade receivables at 31 december 2011

liquidity risk
prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash the availability of funding through
an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions due to
the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses tnt express attempts to maintain flexibility in funding
by keeping committed credit lines available

tnt express has central availability of the following undrawn committed facilities

show andor the preparation of a prospectus a fully marketed offering of part of tnts ordinary
shares postnl and tnt express will work together in preparing the fully marketed offering to the
highest possible standard however such fully marketed offering may not take place during the lockup

express will facilitate such sale by providing an opportunity to perform a limited due diligence
investigation by a bona fide creditworthy potential buyer of more than 5 of the ordinary shares if and

applicable from time to time such due diligence investigation will be similar to a customary due

a decline occurred in europe  mea due to the loss of tnt express russias sa 8000 certification
during their reorganisation process the objective is to reassess tnt express russia after the re
organisation to regain sa 8000 certification this has a relatively large impact on the indicator because
of the limited number of countries in europe  mea that are not members of oecd in other networks
all countries are oecd countries and therefore this indicator is not applicable

6 employee engagement
tnt express continues to seek means to improve employee engagement and utilizes the employee
value proposition evp progress is measured with the global engagement survey  voice the
global engagement survey is performed biennially and for the years in between the voice pulse is
conducted the voice pulse is a short pulse survey that measures the improvement on the key
priorities identified from the voice 2010 survey the voice pulse survey was not designed to measure
engagement and no data is available for 2011

important for the business as a whole such as staffing levels training and the link between reward and
performance and three local questions covering key areas identified for each region or business area
such as support between departments twoway communication between employees and line managers
and the efficiency of the processes the results show that tnt express has made significant
improvement in most areas in 2011 all entities took part in the survey with the exception of brazil and
tnt innight and a response rate of 87 was achieved

for subcontractor road traffic fatal accident information tnt express relies on subcontractors to report
fatal accidents involving their drivers and third parties due to legal obligations and the requirements of
local authorities tnt express is unable to distinguish between blameworthy and nonblameworthy road
traffic fatal accidents involving subcontractors

in 2011 the majority of subcontractor road traffic fatal accidents occurred in india

assists in road safety performance improvements with a number of positive actions being implemented

this support consists for example of effective deployment of the tnt express india road safety
management system and assistance in the effective management of vendors through fleet forum
regular vendor and driver meetings are held to discuss and resolve any road safety or operational
issues the driver training programme continues to operate to improve driving skills and behaviour a
gps vehicle tracking system has been installed for subcontractor linehaul vehicles in india to monitor
operational and road safety performance the road safety action plan has been refreshed with a
continued focus on driver vehicle journey and vendor management

13 serious accidents

patterns before accidents become fatal serious accidents are divided into workplace and road traffic
accidents the analysis of the increase in workplace serious accidents has not revealed any common or
consistent underlying cause

16 co2 emissions absolute
for sector comparison purposes the co2 footprint according to the greenhouse gas protocol
corporate standard revised edition 2004 can be reported in three categories

     scope 1 covers all direct emissions generated by sources that are owned or controlled by the
      company such as operational vehicles aviation and heating
     scope 2 includes all emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the
      company
     scope 3 refers to indirect emissions that are consequences of the companys activities but occur
      from sources not owned or controlled by the company

                                                                       gri indicators lt2 en3 en4  en16

total co2 emissions of own operations scope 1 and 2 was 1191 ktonnes in 2011 compared with
1119 in 2010 the increase of 64 is mainly caused by the increased use of longhaul flights in europe
 mea

the co2 emissions of subcontractors operations decreased by 28 compared with 2010 tnt express
is working with subcontractors to continually improve operational efficiencies

in 2011 52 of the total co2 emissions own and subcontractors was related to road transport 45
was related to air transport and 3 to buildings tnt express is reliant on subcontractors in its business
activities capturing the data related to their activities is one of the biggest challenges in environmental
reporting the subcontracted co2 emissions is calculated based on secondary indicators such as
kilometres driven and costs because of the unavailability of primary data fuel consumption of
subcontracted activities in 2011 57 of the co2 footprint can be attributed to subcontractors

co2 emissions of other operations
tnt express also emits co2 as a result of business travel the co2 emissions of company cars and
business travel by air are reported and in 2011 tnt express offset these emissions

company cars
the lease contracts of tnt express company cars in the netherlands includes a requirement to offset
co2 emissions in 2011 a total of 19 ktonnes was offset which is the same amount as in 2010 the
total co2 emission of all tnt express company cars was 23 ktonnes in 2011 2010 22

business travel by air
in 2011 tnt express offset the co2 emissions of business travel by air booked via the preferred
supplier this was discontinued in august 2011 as the contract was not extended with tnt express




                                                                                                           152

focusing on reducing co2 emissions instead of offsetting in 2011 tnt express offset 25 ktonnes for
business travel by air booked with the preferred travel agency the total co2 emission of all tnt
express business travel by air was 12 ktonnes in 2011 2010 12

17 co2 efficiency index
the co2 efficiency index is based on the operational co2 performance indicators of tnt express core
activities excluding hoau in
 air transport
 road transport and
 buildings

the co2 efficiency index does not include subcontractor emissions as there is insufficient data
available

the co2 efficiency for network flights deteriorated in 2011 while it improved for longhaul flights the
slight volume decrease in network flights resulted in lower aircraft utilisation and therefore a higher co2
efficiency compared with 2010

the co2 efficiency of longhaul flights improved as a result of a review and restructuring of the longhaul
schedule which resulted in higher load factors and operational efficiency improvements

in 2011 tnt express added three boeing 777 freighters to its fleet the boeing 777 freighters fly longer
distances and provide tnt express with more control on its strategic intercontinental routes these
freighters are also the most fuel efficient freighter aircraft available on the market and result in more
economical and environmentally friendly flights

at the end of 2011 tnt express operated 52 aircraft which can be separated into five operational
categories european air network ean domestic longhaul intercontinental charter not included in
the co2 efficiency index and passenger not included in the co2 efficiency index

as of 2012 aviation of tnt express aims to be included in the eu emission trading scheme eu ets
the eu ets includes all flights arriving at or departing from any european union airport and addresses

23 noise
tnt express received seven noise complaints in 2011 compared to 11 in 2010 of these a significant
portion is attributed to noise at depots

establishes rules and procedures with regard to introducing noiserelated operating restrictions at eu
airports the directive requires member states to follow the balanced approach to aircraft noise
management of the international civil aviation organisation

member states must first identify the noise problem and subsequently analyse the various measures
using four principles namely
 reduction of noise at source ie quieter aircraft
 landuse planning and management around airports
 noise abatement operating procedures and
 local operating restrictions relating to noise problems

24 environmental incidents
a total of seven onsite environmental incidents 2010 20 and three offsite environmental incidents

in 2011 total expenditure of moving the world mtw was 35 million 2010 42 compared to 2010
expenditure increased for contributions to learning and development partnership building engagement
and advocacy as well as general management and office operations while it decreased for support
provided to wfp

increases in expenditure were as a result of an increase in the number of projects and assignments
2011 18 2010 10 as well as increased partnership involvement with fleet forum and north star
alliance particularly in india and africa the increase in management and office expenditure was due to
an increase in direct support employees

due to a reduction in global emergencies requiring emergency response teams there was a decrease in
support for wfp operations

during the demerger in 2011 it was decided to support wfp by connecting the operating units and
functions in the regions and countries in which tnt express operates to the various wfp local offices
this is part of the cr strategy in using core skills and knowledge as well as engaging more employees
in global and local activities in support of wfp

other information

corporate responsibility reporting and assurance scope

corporate responsibility reporting criteria
the corporate responsibility data are prepared in accordance with the reporting criteria and guidelines of
the a application level of the global reporting initiative gri g31 and the gri logistics and
transportation sector supplement as far as relevant to tnt express refer to annex 1 tnt express is
also a signatory of the un global compact and therefore reports on the 10 principles therein a bridge
between the gri g31 indicators and the principles of the un global compact is made in the gri g31
index in annex 1 definitions used for key performance indicators kpis are defined in annex 2 kpis
are selected on the basis of interactive stakeholder dialogue and the issues relevant to tnt express
operations

cr data is gathered monthly via a questionnaire all figures are based accordingly on the data
provided by the reporting entities in tnt express through the cr reporting and monitoring tool
conversion factors are taken from internationallyacknowledged organisations such as the inter
governmental panel on climate change the international energy agency and the greenhouse gas
protocol

corporate responsibility reporting scope
in accordance with tnt express policy on cr reporting all companies acquired in any given year are
required to report cr data as from the following year tnt express entities that are divested full or
partial sale whereby tnt express no longer retains a direct or indirect controlling interest are excluded
from the cr reporting scope for the entire year in which the divestment took place

the 2011 annual report includes only cr data from entities that are fullyowned or majorityowned and
from those joint ventures where tnt express has a controlling interest with respect to corporate
responsibility the joint ventures in luxembourg and switzerland are included in the cr reporting
scope whereas png airfreight and x air services are excluded however tnt express does rely on a
large number of subcontractors to perform daily activities tnt express acknowledges its responsibility
and therefore reports on the road traffic fatal accidents of its subcontractors as well as absolute
subcontractor co2 emissions which are estimated

to enable readers to benchmark the 2011 cr data with the 2010 cr data the 2010 reported figures
have been restated to include lit cargo and expresso araçatuba as both entities were not included in
the 2010 assurance scope the external assurance provider is not able to provide assurance on the
2010 data huayuhengye logistics company limited hoau is sometimes excluded from the reported
figures as hoau is not part of the assurance scope comparative 2010 fte and headcount figures are
restated and therefore all fte and headcount related kpis for 2010 are not comparable to the 2010
tnt express supplement

figures are presented in a relative way using percentages and ratios to make it possible for readers to
monitor and measure progress yearonyear unless the reporting criteria require absolute figures to be
disclosed figures related to absolute co2 emissions are all extrapolated to reflect tnt express unless
stated otherwise extrapolation for building related indicators is done on the basis of square metres co2
efficiency indicators are also presented relative to the baseline year of 2007 to show progress made
towards longterm objectives for co2 efficiency improvements wherever applicable the coverage is
defined as the number of ftes working in entities that report data divided by the total number of ftes
tnt express has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the cr information in the 2011 annual report
is accurate

corporate responsibility assurance scope
tnt express has engaged pricewaterhousecoopers accountants nv pwc to provide reasonable
assurance on certain 2011 cr metrics see assurance report 2011 and limited assurance on all other
2011 cr metrics excluding hoau all indicators related to reasonable assurance have been audited and
are marked with a  reasonable assurance is obtained through audit work while other elements of
the report have been reviewed review work provides only limited assurance because exhaustive
gathering of evidence is not required

tnt express policy is to include acquired companies in the assurance scope three years after the year
of acquisition this policy is intended to ensure that these entities can develop their processes to report
cr data to the high standards required by tnt express and to give them time to become sufficiently
aligned with operational and other systems although hoau was acquired in 2007 other business
priorities have prevented hoau from fully implementing tnt express cr reporting requirements hoau
is therefore excluded from the assurance scope

the assurance work is performed in accordance with the assurance standard 3410n assurance
engagements relating to sustainability reports as drawn up by the professional body of dutch
accountants royal nba

as part of the external assurance engagement pwc also makes use of the capacity of the internal audit
department of tnt express pwc reviews the findings of all internal audit reports and meets regularly
with the management of the internal audit department to discuss any findings

an internal control framework has been designed for cr reporting processes for the capture and
reporting of reliable cr data in 2010 the framework was implemented at head office level and in 2011
it was rolledout at country level an implemented internal control framework will not only increase the
reliability of cr data but will also enable pwc in its audits to rely on internal controls more and to
reduce purely dataoriented audit activities

to the executive board of tnt express nv

engagement and responsibilities
as explained in section ii of chapter 5 corporate responsibility statements we have examined the
content of chapters 3 and section ii of chapter 5 and the annexes in the annual report of tnt express
nv hoofddorp tnt express hereafter referred to as cr chapters in which tnt express renders
account of the performance related to corporate responsibility cr in 2011

our examination consisted of the following combination of audit and review procedures
 audit of all data and tables related to the following key performance indicators
     the number of employees and full time equivalents employed
     the percentage of tnt express workforce at certified sites
     the number of workplace fatal accidents and road traffic fatal accidents excluding
        subcontractor fatal accidents
     the number of serious accidents
     the number of lost time accidents and the ratio of lost time accidents per 100 fte
     the absolute co2 footprint of owned operations scope 1 and 2
     co2 efficiency index
     co2 efficiency of buildings
     co2 efficiency of fleet split into small trucks large trucks european air network flights
        including domestic flights and longhaul flights and
     the percentage of sustainable electricity
 review of all the other elements of the cr chapters not excluded from our assurance scope

the executive board of tnt express is responsible for the preparation of the cr chapters we are
responsible for providing an assurance report on the cr chapters

reporting criteria
tnt express developed its reporting criteria on the basis of the g31 guidelines of the global reporting
initiative gri as explained on pages 158159 corporate responsibility reporting and assurance scope
these reporting criteria contain certain inherent limitations which may influence the reliability of the
information

the cr chapters do not cover the information for all entities of tnt express as the cr chapters only
include data from entities that are fullyowned or majorityowned and from those joint ventures where
tnt express has a controlling interest with respect to cr detailed information on the reporting scope is
given on page 158 corporate responsibility reporting and assurance scope we consider the reporting
criteria to be relevant and appropriate for our examination

scope and work performed
we planned and performed our work in accordance with dutch law including standard 3410n
assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports

audit procedures focus on obtaining reasonable assurance substantiated by sufficient and appropriate
supporting audit evidence the audited data are marked with a rhombus  review procedures focus
on obtaining limited assurance which does not require exhaustive gathering of evidence therefore
providing less assurance than audit procedures consequently we report our conclusions with respect
to the audit and review procedures separately we believe these combined procedures fulfill a rational
objective

we do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and feasibility of prospective information such as
targets expectations and ambitions included in the cr chapters

audit procedures
with regard to the audited data among other things we have gathered audit evidence as follows
 performing an external environment analysis and obtaining insight into the industry relevant social
    issues relevant laws and regulations and the characteristics of the organisation
 assessing and testing the systems and processes used for data gathering consolidation and
    validation including the methods used for calculating and estimating results




                                                                                                       160

                                                                                                   statements
                                                                                                    chapter 5



   testing the design existence and the effectiveness of the relevant internal control measures during
    the reporting period
   reconciling reported data to internal and external source documentation
   examining the existence and validity of certificates issued in respect of the management system
    standards which have been adopted by tnt express and
   performing analytical procedures relation checks and detailed checks

review procedures
our most important review procedures were
 assessing the acceptability and consistent application of the reporting policies in relation to the
    information requirements of tnt express stakeholders
 reviewing internal and external documentation to determine whether the information in the cr
    chapters is substantiated adequately
 validating and testing of the model used for estimating the co2 emissions of subcontractors
 evaluating the overall presentation of the cr chapters in line with tnt express reporting criteria
    and
 assessing the application level according to the g31 guidelines of gri

we believe that the evidence obtained from our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our conclusions

limitations in our examination
for comparative purposes tnt express has restated the 2010 figures to include the information for the
entities lit cargo chile and araçatuba brazil because these entities were excluded from our
assurance scope last year we do not provide assurance on the 2010 comparative figures

the data from huayu hengye logistics company ltd hoau china is excluded from our assurance
scope this is adequately disclosed on pages 158159 corporate responsibility reporting and assurance
scope we have accepted this limitation in our scope because providing assurance on data from this
reporting entity would not provide a rational objective at this stage as tnt express is still in the progress
of integrating this entity into its business

conclusions

opinion based on our audit procedures
in our opinion all data and tables marked with a rhombus as mentioned under engagement and
responsibilities are in all material respects presented reliably and adequately in accordance with tnt
express reporting criteria

conclusion based on our review procedures
with respect to the other elements of the cr chapters not excluded from our assurance scope nothing
has come to our attention that would cause us to conclude that the cr chapters in all material respects
do not provides a reliable and adequate presentation of the cr policy of tnt express or of the cr
related performance during the reporting year in accordance with tnt express reporting criteria
