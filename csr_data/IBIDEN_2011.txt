    on behalf of the ibiden group i would like to express our deepest
    condolences to the people who have lost loved ones in the earth

    areas

    consequences to its production nevertheless having drawn valu
    able lessons from the recent disaster the task force for risk man
    agement is reviewing the groups contingency planning designed to
    prevent and reduce disasterinduced damages and administer quick
    responses when a disaster strikes in an effort to further enhance our
    business continuity capabilities

    ment practice underscored by a high degree of reliability and transparency for the benefit of stakeholders based
    on our belief that this path ensures sustainable growth beyond our centennial year toward the next milestone of
    the companys bicentennial anniversary
        to encourage csr management in workplace the ibiden group charter of behavior was revised in july 2011
    after rounds of discussions during fiscal year 2010 aimed at giving concrete form to the ideal envisioned by the
    group the new charter an extension of ouribiden waymade more suitable for daytoday applications sum
    marizes this ideal the charter also serves as the base for our future activities including discussions on the organiza
    tional mechanisms that should be enhanced and placed under management and the execution of specific actions
    to reach the ideal state of operations in addition employeesconduct is governed by a separate set of standards
    known asibiden standards for employee behavior

    recalibrating for globalization
    as overseas operations now account for more than 75 of the groups net sales we are opting for increased ef
    forts in the path to globalization to boost local production and accelerate the localization of our overseas plants by
    local management teams it is essential to foster personnel capable of successfully negotiating the shift to globaliza
    tion the global human resource strategy serves as the basis for enhancing competitiveness across the group
        our behavior charter also addresses human rights anticorruption and other universal ethical principles with
    which fuller compliance is called for by the international community the entire ibiden group continues to base its
    actions on the charter in an effort to become an organization completely trusted by its stakeholders in the interna
    tional community and to achieve further growth

    advancing csroriented management in step with stakeholders
    to be a trusted partner in the international community we need to initiate and maintain dialogues with our stake
    holders and undertake actions by working closely with them beyond the confines of our group equally important
    is our challenge of building a reliable supply chain system with suppliers to achieve the consistent delivery of our
    products and services for this reason this fiscal year we formulated a set of csr guidelines designed for our suppli
    ers as their cooperation is essential for the successful upgrading of our supply chain
        the ibiden group continues its proactive disclosure of information on its financial condition products and csr
    and promotes transparent management practice in an attempt to help stakeholders gain a greater understanding

    addressing risks
    the ibiden group undertakes risk management activities so that we may continue to reliably conduct our
    business operations we regularly detect and assess risks to reduce risks in important areas operational divi
    sions are working on the risks related to strengthening our business competitive edge while functional divi
    sions are addressing the risks bringing serious repercussions to the companys business in fiscal year 2010
    focusing on the risk of legal violation as a companywide risk we built a legal compliance system and imple
    mented measures for managing legal compliance at each functional division
        as for measures to be taken when disasters such as earthquakes occur we believe that lifesaving comes
    first followed by the early supply of products to customers to prepare for earthquakes we not only check
    each buildings resistance to earthquakes but also determine the items matters and divisions for actions to be
    taken in regard to damage prevention and anticipation we also create a list of suppliers so that we can
    promptly take steps when earthquakes or other disasters occur

    to earn the trust of international society while operating business globally both the group and the entire sup

        ibiden disclosed requests to suppliers based on its basic purchasing policies in fiscal year 2008 and held
    a briefing session for 100 suppliers the next year confirming the status of their measures this enabled us to
    confirm the gap in measures among the suppliers and recognize the necessity of management that has led to
    more specific improvements in the supply chain
        in fiscal year 2010 ibiden discussed the tasks to be tackled by our suppliers and their management ac
    cording to the ibiden group charter of behavior and developed a supply chain management plan that has

      bolstering compliance activities

    compliance education
    the company runs a broad array of education programs including levelspecific and workplacespecific train
    ing designed to enhance employee awareness of the importance of compliance these programs include
    group discussions on causes of violations of the employeescode of conduct and actions taken in response
    to the violations they educate every single trainee in consciously deciding on the right action in a given situa
    tion
       we continually provide our own csr portal site on the intranet and examples of compliance practices in
    our internal magazine and on the intranet as another way to improve staff awareness

    whistleblowing system
    after learning of any suspected compliance violation in the group employees are generally required to report
    it to consult and to take action using the chain of command between the superior and the subordinate we
    have however established a compliance consultation service for quickly solving any problem that cannot be
    reported through the usual channels the service is available not only to employees of ibiden group compa
    nies but to all those working for the group we provide three access channels to facilitate consultation one
    inside the company another at a lawyers office and the other at an outside organization
         in fiscal year 2010 we provided consultations in 54 cases for the entire group in japan although most of
    the consultations were related to the issues that could lead to issues related to potential harassment case
    and labor management none of them significantly affected our business activities moreover at workplaces
    where problems were observed seminars and other events are held individually to prevent recurrence to
    discover and deal with problems as early as possible we will continue our educational activities to enhance
    our reliability by offering a consultation service that can be safely used by those who seek consultation
         in addition we will set up a consultation service for our supplier in fiscal year 2011 we will create an envi
    ronment where we not only offer consultations internally but also gather valuable feedback on ibiden         s com
    pliance from our regular supplier

    selfcheck
    to clarify compliance issues at plants a selfcheck on morality security and respect for human rights is con
    ducted once a year on a plantbyplant basis any problem identified in this process will be addressed through
    remedial activities specific to the plant
       employees holding managerial posts are required to submit themselves to annual selftesting to measure
    their understanding of the ibiden standards for employee behavior and their state of compliance with the
    standards for identification of topics that are not fully understood case studies illustrating compliancerelated
    issues that many testtakers failed to answer correctly are published to increase their understanding

    revision to the standards for employee behavior
    the ibiden standards for employee behavior are continually evolving in light of the globalization of our ex
    panding business operations taking into consideration the expectations of our stakeholders we add and re
    vise provisions on worker rights with which we must comply as internal standards we have also established
    the standards for employee behavior based on such international standards at our main production plants
    overseas and we are making efforts to provide thorough education on human rights and ethics according to
    these standards
       upon the revision of the ibiden group charter of behavior in fiscal year 2011 ibiden will reorganize the
    code of conduct so that employees who must comply with it can understand it more easily and we will con
    tinue our efforts to promote their compliance

    entire supply chain beyond the group is indispensable in our letter addressed to suppliers we specifically re
    quest that laborrelated human rights be observed including bans on child labor and forced labor in addition
    we confirm the state of compliance by suppliers by sending out periodic questionnaires

    suppliers regarding labor and human rights as well as their management we will then implement surveys and
    visit their facilities

      coping with climate change issues

    through private power generation activities to supply clean energy as well as energy conservation efforts in
    manufacturing activities we are working to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions to upgrade our private
    power generation systems we are boosting our hydroelectric power generation capacity improving thermal
    power generation efficiency and promoting fuel conversion with regard to energy conservation efforts in
    manufacturing activities we are accelerating the improvement of energy conservation practices throughout
    the company by strengthening companywide co2 reduction activities while all manufacturing divisions man
    age the basic unit of energy consumption and set specific targets for each division

    measures to supply clean energy
    the ibiden group can trace its history back to a scheme aimed at building a hydroelectric power plant up
    stream on the ibigawa river to supply power and attract industry and thereby help revitalize the nearby city
    of ogaki the group was established under the name ibigawa electric company in 1912 but over time began
    to utilize electricity to evolve into an electrochemical company we have continued to expand our business
    since then including areas such as carbides carbon building materials ceramic products and electronic prod
    ucts as we have grown and developed hand in hand with local communities
        ibiden owns three hydroelectric power plants in the upstream section of ibigawa river in gifu prefecture
    hydraulic power generation uses the potential energy of water to create clean energy without greenhouse
    gas emissions
        we introduced a cogeneration system in 1992 to use clean energy instead of purchased electric power
    increasing our clean energy supply while generating power from turbines that operate by fuel combustion
    this system also uses waste heat to produce steam which is then used in factories as a consequence the
    system excels in energy efficiency
        in addition we recently introduced largescale solar power systems on the rooftop of our head office build
    ing in november 2005 and in the ogaki central plant in march 2008
        as a result of our initiatives in clean energy the co2 emission factor for the electric power consumed is
    nearly half that of the purchased electricity
        we are consistently trying to increase our use of natural energy such as hydroelectric power and solar
    power and improve the efficiency of a cogeneration system with a high level of environmental performance
    as a consequence power we generated inhouse supplied nearly 60 of the power we consumed in fiscal
    year 2010 we have successfully reduced co2 emissions by approx 97000 t co2 for fiscal year 2010 from
    the quantity emitted to generate purchased electric power

    a shift in fuels
    to encourage the use of clean energy we are moving away from petroleumbased fuels in favor of gasbased
    fuels that emit less co2 in fiscal year 2006 we built liquefied natural gas lng satellite facilities in partner
    ship with a local gas company to give ourselves the ability to use lng this led to 94 in the fossil fuel gasifi
    cation ratio on annual average and the reduction of co2 emissions by 44 kt in fiscal year 2010 please refer
    to the graphpercentage of shift in fuels
    lng liquefied natural gas

    energy conservation
    while striving to strengthen our manufacturing system all divisions throughout the company are making ener
    gy conservation improvements to reduce the co2 emissions unit load each month we hold atraining camp
    where members from all divisions of the company take part in energy conservation activities to combat global
    warming the manufacturing division and the related functional divisions meet to hold repeated discussions
    create an activity plan report on their progress and disclose relevant cases to share information on improve
    ments with our managements advice we follow the pdca cycle to improve energy conservation globally
    we aim to improve energy conservation by 3 annually based on the co2 emissions unit load per production
    volume for fiscal year 2008 in fiscal year 2010 total co2 emissions rose due to our increased production vol
    ume and the launch of new plants nonetheless we successfully reduced the co2 emissions unit load by 12
    per production volume from that in fiscal year 2008 please refer to the graphco2 emission andco2 emis

    ibiden believes that it is an important responsibility of businesses to make effective use of the world
    resources and to take part in a global effort to conserve resources we promote the socalled 3r activity
    which consists of initiatives to reduce reuse and recycle the resources we consume in doing so we aim to
    improve the resources efficiency since 2004 ibiden has been maintaining a zeroemission status in terms of
    solid waste
        the ibiden group sets an index to control solid waste per production volume and has been taking action
    to implement such control based on the production volume unit load for fiscal year 2008 we aim to improve
    it by 1 annually the production volume for fiscal year 2010 increased from the previous year but nonethe
    less we successfully reduced solid waste per production volume by 5 compared from that in fiscal year
    2008 please refer to the graphamount of solid waste and solid waste unit load rate

    ibiden defines zero emission as a state in which no solid waste emitted from the production process is dumped in landfills


    effective utilization and reduction of water resources water conservation efforts
    a large amount of water resources is used in the manufacturing process of electronic products particularly for
    cleansing even though there is abundant underground water in ogaki city in gifu prefecture where our do
    mestic manufacturing bases are concentrated water shortages are a serious problem in the world today
    based on the principle of socalled 3r activityinitiatives to reduce reuse and recycle resourcesthe group
    carries out business activities by integrating environmental technologies into manufacturing technologies
    which has reduced the amount of industrial water use to ensure the optimum control of wastewater and ef
    fluent and the facilitation of 3r activity for water resources since fiscal year 2008 all concerned divisions have
    been meeting every month for a full day of discussion to confirm and report on the progress
        the ibiden group sets a benchmark for managing the water withdrawal per production volume our tar
    get is a 3 improvement per year with the basic unit of the production volume water withdrawal rate in
    2008 as the benchmark in fiscal year 2010 although we experienced some losses due to facility expansion
    or startup in preparation for mass production the water withdrawal rate for fiscal year 2010 achieved a 23
    decrease compared to fiscal year 2008 we will continue our commitment to reducing the water withdrawal
    rate at all plants by means of water conservation and recycling activities please refer to the graphwater
