 corporate governance

unitika aims to be a company with a clear social presence that contributes positively to the environment and to peoples lives
          under this management vision the unitika group will implement ongoing corporate governance initiatives
   basic policy for corporate governance
through our management philosophy of contributing to society by connecting peoples lives to technology we at the unitika
group aim to be a company with a clear social presence we strive to achieve stakeholderfocused management by pursuing
governance strategies that include the enhancement of legal compliance and risk management and the timely and appropriate
disclosure of information and the implementation of rapid decision making the unitika group considers that its pursuit of the
creation of a management system focused on these goals will allow it to maximize corporate value amidst the globalization of
the business environment

   implementation
unitika employs an executive director system that clearly distinguishes operational decisionmaking and supervisory functions
governance from business execution functions management at the same time we also use a system wherein directors also
serve as executive officers in order to enhance coordination between directors and executive officers and improve the agility and
effectiveness of management
we have positioned the board of directors as a governance organization focused on management decisionmaking and
supervision meanwhile we have established the management strategy council which is responsible for the early identification of
management issues the streamlining and acceleration of policymaking and implementation and the appropriate and timely
implementation of policies and measures in addition to facilitating more indepth discussions amongst directors on policies and
issues pertaining to all aspects of the groups management
while we have already established authorization regulations that set forth provisions regarding the execution of business we
employ a decisionmaking system in which items of business of particular importance are discussed and deliberated on in
advance by the management strategy council before consulting the board of directors
our internal control system can respond at the appropriate time and consists of a variety of organizations including the csr office
which is staffed by ten permanent employees and is the body primarily responsible for gathering information from within the
company and the group the compliance committee which is chaired by the president and whistleblower contact points both
inside and outside the company
furthermore we work to educate our staff regarding legal compliance by conducting suitable training through the csr office and
distributing the unitika action charter and the unitika action standards to all group employees in addition to other initiatives

concern for our employees
unitikas personnel system is designed to encourage employee selfactualization we provide equal employment
and work opportunities and make every effort to create accommodating workplace environments

 personnel system

   personnel appraisal system
unitikas personnel appraisal system emphasizes employees effort and is designed to increase the organizations vitality it is
a resultsdriven system that awards greater benefits to employees who achieve greater success or tackle more difficult
challenges a biannual goal management system and annual competency evaluation system are used along with our human
resources development program they impartially evaluate how well each employee is meeting their goals and help them set
new goals to develop their abilities supervisors meet with each employee to discuss their evaluation results ensuring that
everyone receives proper feedback for better transparency and communication

   selfreporting system career plan
once a year at the time of the annual personnel appraisal employees submit a career plan sheet to selfreport how much
aptitude they feel they have for their position the career plan sheet covers five main areas 1 the employees thoughts on
their current position 2 their own medium to longterm career plan 3 what they want to achieve next in their career such
as whether they want to be reassigned 4 their strengths and how they have been working on achieving their career plan
and 5 comments on their current job position such as their concerns and improvement suggestions in the workplace these
comments are used to clearly identify skill development goals and expectations regarding roles furthermore we also confirm
whether employees of a certain age would like to use a reemployment system
unitika is aware of the importance of job rotation in fostering outstanding human resources our practice of periodic job
rotation especially for young employees helps employees improve their abilities by giving them the opportunity to work in
several departments and helps us spot candidates to fasttrack

 safety  health activities
while the unitika groups mediumterm safety and health plan implemented in 2008 the 14th program running from 200810
sets a target of zero workplace accidents seven such accidents occurred in fiscal 2009 an increase on fiscal 2008 the rate of
lost work time also worsened to 117 during fiscal 2009 however some successes were also achieved as a result of the safety
and health activities promoted by our mediumterm safety and health plan with the environmental business division
successfully reaching 10 million hours of accidentfree operation
the increase in workplace accidents can be attributed to a variety of causes including aging equipment and facilities
increased dangers in factories group companies and workplaces due to generational turnover and other factors in light of this
situation the unitika group is focusing on educational activities for example by conducting safety diagnoses at plants and
group companies moreover the group also conducts risk assessments to clarify latent dangers in equipment and facilities and
implement measures to reduce workplace accidents

 plantderived biomass material

   terramac
terramac is a biomass material made from a polymer derived from plants such as corn biomass materials are organic resources
derived from sustainable biological sources except for fossil resources terramac ultimately degrades into carbon dioxide and
water which are absorbed into plants such as corn for their growth then the corn can be turned terramac again so terramac
is part of the worlds natural recycling system conventional plastic products are made from oil a limited and nonrenewable raw
material that will run out in the notsodistant future if we continue using it as a nonoilbased plastic product terramac is hence
the focus of much attention it has a wide range of applications in clothing plateware cups wrapping films cosmetic bottles
teabags planters trash bags electronic device components and all areas of consumer demand unitika has developed the
worlds first heatresistant foam containers and food containers made of polylactic acid the base ingredient of terramac these
products are attracting a lot of attention for their ability to hold hot water and their microwavesafe design terramac is used in
applications such as mobile phone casings which require demanding durability and heat resistance specifications and digital
mfp parts which are required to be fireresistant recently we have used alloy technology to develop a new heatresistant grade
of resin for injection molding that features improved molding performance and shock resistance than conventional resins this
resin is used as an exterior covering for health meters and other applications combining the natural advantages of plant material
with human technology terramac is an attempts to be the ideal material supported by both the earth and human beings
