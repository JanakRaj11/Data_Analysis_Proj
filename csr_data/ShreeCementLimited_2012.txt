most important factor for determining overall productivity                      pm             sox          nox
and profitability during fy 201011 we developed a gps
based system for dynamic allocation of dumpers to
excavators in real time thus reducing time lost in queuing
of dumpers at excavators or idling of the latter a real
time display of entire mining operations was also set up at
the central control room with automatic management of
key performance indicators and alerts we also integrated
fuel management system into the oitds
through this initiative we reaped several benefits we
were able to reduce idle time of dumpers and excavators
increase production of limestone by using less number of
dumpers and reduce unwanted travel of dumpers we
were also able to defer procurement of two dumpers
owing to better optimization resulting in an immediate
benefit of inr 30 million
through this initiative we have been able to reduce our
ghg emissions from equipment movement in mining
operations significantly the overall cost of the project                                                                 our sustainability performance enhancement target
