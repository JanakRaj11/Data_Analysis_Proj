towards solar economy
at fortum we believe that there is a need to make a transition from
traditional energy production towards solar economy with infinite and
zeroemission energy production and high resource and system efficiency
  a development towards producing and consuming energy in a smarter
way this report discusses the different angles of solar economy and presents        advanced
fortums view as well as activities regarding the future energy system

nuclear power project under construction
and in the new olkiluoto 4 project the
bidding and engineering phase of which
was launched in autumn in sweden we
have raised the output and improved the
availability of nuclear power plants

how did fortum achieve its
sustainability targets in 2011
we achieved out climate targets although
the specific co2 emissions from our total
energy production increased by nearly
10 from the previous year the increase
was due to the commissioning of new
plants which raised the relative share of
our russian mainly natural gasbased
production in our total energy production
