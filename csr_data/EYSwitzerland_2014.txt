a note from the
country managing

bruno chiomento
country managing partner
ey switzerland




together with the people of ey switzerland i am building a better working world every day this may sound like a
bold claim and it is our organizations purpose runs through every service we deliver every interaction with our
clients and it helps me personally make decisions our quality services build trust and confidence in the capital
markets and in the swiss economy but perhaps the greatest contribution to sustainability is our role in shaping
the next generation of professionals

my own career with ey started in the late 80s at what was           to grow in the right direction we successfully expanded our
then atag arthur young so im actually a product of the ey          advisory capacities just as demand for consulting was picking
experience myself ive also seen a lot of people come and go        up for example the regulatory factors driving market change
over the years in my current role im always pleased when          are numerous  recently weve seen debates on base erosion and
i run into former ey colleagues many of whom now occupy             profit shifting the eus auditor rotation rules and the corporate
important positions in business it shows that our business          tax reform in switzerland with our vast knowledge base we
model works and that it adds value to the market we train          can anticipate and respond to challenges successfully for our
qualified professionals for the swiss market  whether they          clients and for ourselves
ultimately choose to stay at ey delivering exceptional client
service or go on to work for a client or elsewhere and             in a world thats more complex and dynamic than ever before
im proud of the contribution we make to a sustainable swiss         i believe theres one thing that will never change and thats
economy                                                             the value of highquality services and insights our support
                                                                     helps clients grow innovate and prosper  and strong clients
while we pride ourselves on being a center for education and         mean a healthy economy by delivering valueadded we play
knowledge transfer we also need to retain the best talent a        an important part in ensuring sustainable systems a thriving
major challenge in the coming years will be stabilizing employee     labor market and future prospects for the next generations
turnover at an appropriate level especially in light of the         ey switzerland as a firm mirrors this concept on a much smaller
demographic change that is already upon us weve made good          scale the partners want to hand over an even stronger company
progress so far reducing turnover from 241 in the prior           to those that follow giving them a chance to realize their own
year to 197 in 2014 retention rates depend on employee            potential so there is intrinsic motivation driving sustainability
contentment so im greatly encouraged by the results of our
latest people pulse survey which measures employees overall        oldworld corporate social responsibility was about giving
satisfaction with ey as an employer we scored 62 compared          something back it said we contribute to society because we
to 58 last year and i hope that our commitment to lifelong          are successful newworld sustainability is about creating
learning flexibility and choice will be reflected in a continuing   shared value it says we are successful because we contribute
upward trend                                                        to society i hope you enjoy reading this report and finding
                                                                     out how ey switzerland is contributing to a sustainable future
as an inherently diverse country switzerland has not always         by building a better working world every day
consciously focused on diversity and inclusiveness in the past
that needs to change we have set clear goals aimed at making
a difference in gender diversity we want to triple the number
of women partners at ey switzerland to at least 15 by 2020

like all service providers we have to adapt and respond to the
needs of an evolving market we have to innovate and we have        bruno chiomento

travel extensively  by plane train and automobile  to deliver     be expected given that the periodic travel ban of fy13 was not
exceptional client service as a result business travel is by far   repeated in fy14 overall the figures still paint a positive
our greatest source of greenhouse gas emissions new and             picture for instance the number of pkm from shorthaul flights
exciting technological capabilities are helping reduce the need      actually decreased slightly falling 15 to 6088990 fy13
for travel though  through videoconferencing and instant           6181628 furthermore the significant increase of 92 in
access to global information networks and knowledge                pkm by train suggests that people are switching to rail travel
