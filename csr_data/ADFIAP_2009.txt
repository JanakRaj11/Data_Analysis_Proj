      view forward
      from continuity to sustainability

          over the past five years when we implemented our strategic plan amid
          strong global economic growth and unprecedented consumer demand
          adfiap remained steadfast in our commitment to sustainable development
                                                   now the economic pendulum has swung in the other direction        in addition our members are mostly based in perhaps the
                                                   nearly every industry our memberdfis serve is now gripped         most diverse regions in the world the asia pacific region
                                                   by the economic crisis these challenges might tempt us to         our challenge as the focal point of financing sustainable
                                                   take a detour in our sustainable development journey but          devlopment is how to contextualize and adapt sustainability
                                                   we believe the current economic situation makes the pursuit        issues into each of these various settings
                                                   of sustainability even more imperative for our association

how do you see adfiap evolving in the next several
years as an association with expanded service and
programs for its members

obp our members are naturally looking for more
value from adfiap they look to us to have a sense
of community so that they will not be a lone voice
when it comes to the pursuit of sustainability
goals

as in the past adfiap has and will always be
focused on delivering value to its members
partners and other stakeholders in the areas
that it has competence and credibility ie
in the financing of sustainable development
adfiap will always adapt to ongoing changes
and will always be prepared to lead its
members in the sustainability sphere

thats our major focus for 2009 and
beyond  continuing to make sustainable
development possible for our members
and the communities where they operate
well also keep driving sustainability into
our internal processes particularly in our
secretariat we will persistently challenge
ourselves to seek innovative ways to meet
these goals
