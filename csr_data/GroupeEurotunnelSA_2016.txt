4   risk factors

    in conducting its business the eurotunnel group is exposed to different risks of an industrial environmental human commercial
    financial or other nature

    the eurotunnel group applies the provisions of the reference framework published by the french financial markets authority
    amf for internal control and risk management systems eurotunnel group has an active risk management policy designed to
    protect and develop its assets and reputation and to safeguard the interests of shareholders employees customers suppliers its
    other stakeholders and the environment the group has a comprehensive system in place to identify and manage risks which is
    described in section 169 internal control and risk management procedures of this registration document

    for the 2015 financial year the eurotunnel group has carried out the annual review of risks that could have a significant negative
    impact on its operations reputation financial position or results this risk review was conducted for all the consolidated
    subsidiaries of the group the risk management mechanisms now apply across the entire scope of consolidation

    the main risk factors that the group considered to be exposed to at the date of this registration document are described in the
    chapter below there may be other risks that the group had no knowledge of or considered to be immaterial at the date of this
    registration document and that could have an adverse effect




    41 risks related to the environment in which the
    eurotunnel group operates

    411 risks related to the economic and political climate

    risk identification
    the groups operations are directly influenced by the prevailing economic conditions in its main markets particularly france and
    the united kingdom changes in crosschannel traffic and rail freight traffic are linked to the general economic context while the
    groups business has demonstrated its resilience during crisis periods and although the british and french economies did
    continue their growth in 2015 the worsening or stagnation of economic conditions could have a direct impact on crosschannel
    traffic volumes in both the passenger and freight activities uncertainties about the general economic situation as well as the
    turmoil in the financial markets including the concerns mainly related to china have had and are likely to continue to have a
    negative impact on the business performance and financial position of many companies and this could have repercussions for the
    groups customers and suppliers

    various events could change the economic environment in which the group operates and could accordingly affect its business in
    particular a political decision taken by either one of the two nations to withdraw from the european union could also weaken the
    pound sterling if only because of uncertainties related to the possible exit of the united kingdom from the european union and
    affect the economy and trade between great britain and continental europe and could thus have an impact on the groups traffic
    volumes

    furthermore the political climate currently faced by the group is sensitive be it the increased sensitivity arising from the terrorist
    risk in the wake of the attacks in france in january and november 2015 or the rising flow of migrants in europe


    risk monitoring and management
    all economic risks are measured and monitored at meetings of the corporate management committees described in
    section 1692 of this registration document to anticipate and prepare for changes in the economic environment and to make
    any necessary strategic and tactical adjustments the group cannot however guarantee that its results will not be affected by
    upheavals in the economic or political conditions

    the political context of the groups business is a key factor considered by the management to establish jointly with concerned
    public authorities the control arrangements needed to secure the fixed link and of customers and employees

412 risks related to the competitive environment

risk identification
in its different activities the group faces strong competition from both international and national players in the private and public
sectors this competitive environment presented in chapter 6 of this registration document could intensify across all of the
groups areas of activity particularly in a context of competitive volatility and increased sensitivity among customers to the quality
of service


fixed link
with regard to the activities of the fixed link the eurotunnel group faces competition from crosschannel transportation
operators whose pricing strategies and other competitive initiatives could have a negative impact on shuttle service volumes
particularly truck shuttle services although the number of competitors on the short straits is now reduced to two and on
passenger numbers in highspeed passenger trains the market growth and the competitive pressure are impacted structurally
by the pound sterlingeuro exchange rate fluctuations and as the case may be by fluctuations in the price of fuel which may affect
competitors pricing policy as indicated in chapter 6 of this registration document the groups commercial and operational
strategy could be affected in this context in which service quality remains a crucial distinguishing factor


europorte
concerning the competitive environment of europorte developments in the market and in rail freight transport traffic and related
activities are due to recent changes quite specific as a result of a complex amalgamation of economic logistical and industrial
factors including the reliability of the transport service the quality of train paths and the balanced prioritisation of freight and
passenger transport french rail freight traffic has undergone a significant downturn since 2000 with freight volume virtually
halved reaching its alltime low in 2010 followed by a somewhat modest recovery in 20111 in 2015 competition between the
operators remained strong and the longstanding operator continues to enjoy a predominant position in the market a position that
is likely to be further strengthened with the entry into force of a law establishing the railways reform adopted in the summer of
2014 that groups together two operational public institutions under a lead public institution the new sncf namely the
                                   
infrastructure manager sncf reseau                                                 the situation is different in great britain where
                                          and the mobility operator sncf mobilites
rail freight is developing and where it is anticipated that it will take an even greater share of the british freight transport market
except the coal market which has declined following the changes to britains energy policy which could have an impact on
gbrfs growth


risk monitoring and management
in response to this intensification of competition the group is rationalising its operations and processes in order to adapt its cost
structure offering new services to its customers and enhancing its commercial offering

the group adapts its marketing strategy to this competitive environment particularly during operational reviews of its various
business segments

4   risk factors

    risk monitoring and management
    as part of the groups treasury management procedures described in section 169 of this registration document the eurotunnel
    group finance department continually monitors movements in inflation and interest rates and the treasury risk management
    committee receives monthly reports containing forecast and actual rate changes


    b interest rate
    risk identification
    the group is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuation during the term loan


    risk monitoring and management
    as indicated in note x of the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document the risk of
    adverse movements in interest rates during the life of the term loan is covered by the fact that i six tranches of the loan are at a
    fixed rate ii the two inflationlinked tranches are at a fixed rate and iii the last two tranches are at a floating rate and are covered
    by a swap converting the floating rate into a fixed rate for the full life of the term loan


    c rate of inflation
    risk identification
    as indicated in note x of the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document the inflation risk
    affects both interest and principal repayments on the two inflationlinked tranches of 750 million and e367 million respectively by
    way of illustration a variation in the inflation rate by one point would have an annual impact of e17 million on the amount of the
    principal of tranche a and the associated financial charges


    d exchange rate risk
    risk identification
    around half of the eurotunnel groups revenue is generated in sterling while a larger proportion of expenditure operating expense
    and investment is payable in euros moreover the groups term loan is denominated in sterling for the nominal amount of
    1452 billion at 31 december 2015 and in euros for the nominal amount of e1909 billion at 31 december 2015

    the groups various business activities result in receivables and payables between the different group companies sometimes in
    different currencies particularly between get se and its subsidiaries the group arranges funding for its various business
    activities but these intragroup financing arrangements may generate currency imbalances which as a result of exchange rate
    risk and depending on the direction of the funding flows may automatically translate into losses in the consolidated financial
    statements


    risk monitoring and management
    the eurotunnel group endeavours to match more closely the currencies in which its revenues and expenses are denominated and
    may also use currency hedging to manage its foreign exchange risk effectively however there is no guarantee that these
    measures will significantly reduce the risk borne by the eurotunnel group in the event of a fall in the sterling against the euro or
    ensure that the materialisation of this risk would not have a significant impact on the eurotunnel groups financial position andor
    ability to service its debt

    the eurotunnel group prepares its consolidated financial statements in euros at 31 december 2015 its balance sheet exposure to
    trading currencies was as follows

e credit and counterparty risks
customer credit risk
risk identification
the groups exposure to credit risk is limited to its customers in the united kingdom and eurozone countries with the
exception of
 the railways public institutions which accounted for 26 of the groups revenue in 2015
 the groups passenger shuttle customers who pay for their tickets in advance particularly via the internet consequently the
   credit risk in relation to these customers is very limited

the groups maximum exposure to credit risk on trade receivables as well as the ageing of those trade receivables and the
provision for bad debts is explained in detail in note q to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this
registration document

credit risk is limited in view of the distribution and volumes of the customer portfolio in fact revenue from the groups five largest
customers not including the railways only accounted for 8 of its total revenue in 2015


risk monitoring and management
the group manages its customer credit risk through a policy requiring that every new customer undergo a credit check before
being able to benefit from the groups standard credit terms the groups credit risk exposure to account customers is managed
through the continuous monitoring of their financial situation and of their outstanding debt in relation to the credit limits and
payment terms granted to them


suppliers
risk identification
the group is exposed to counterparty risk with its suppliers arising from the risk that the contracting party fails to fulfil its
commitments delivery payment repayment etc


risk monitoring and management
the groups exposure to counterparty risk with its suppliers is managed by framework agreements that contain standard
mechanisms such as thirdparty guarantees


shortterm investments
risk identification
the groups maximum exposure to credit risk on shortterm investments is set out in note x to the consolidated financial
statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document




                                                                                 2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se                    9

4    risk factors

     risk monitoring and management
     the group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in i term deposits and certificates of deposit with a maximum maturity
     of six months and with counterparties with a shortterm rating of at least p1 from moodys and ii funds and money market funds
     with a longterm rating of at least aaa from moodys or aaa from sp

     the amounts invested by the group in any one fund or money market fund should not exceed e120 million per fund or money
     market fund denominated in euros or 100 million per fund or money market fund denominated in sterling investments in term
     deposits or certificates of deposit with the same counterparty may not exceed e100 million or 75 million

     the treasury risk management committee monitors the groups compliance with this investment policy


     liquidity risk
     risk identification
     a significant proportion of the eurotunnel groups operational cash flow is taken up by interest payments on the term loan and
     since 2013 ongoing repayment of the principal in instalments until 2050 this expense could reduce the groups capacity to
     finance its investments or possible external growth operations

     a breakdown of the groups financial liabilities by contractual maturity is given in note x to the consolidated financial statements in
     paragraph 2031 of this registration document

     the terms and conditions of the groups bank loans particularly concerning defaults and early repayment as well as the financial
     covenants that the group must comply with in respect of debt servicing are described in chapter 22 of this registration document
     and in note v to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document

     the contractual terms of the groups hedging instruments swaps to cover its floatingrate loans are explained in note v to the
     consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document


     risk monitoring and management
     the group manages its liquidity risk exposure through centralised treasury management by its finance department that
     continually monitors the groups cash position the group also prepares monthly short and medium term cash flow forecasts
     which are presented to the treasury risk management committee composed of the corporate finance director who chairs the
     committee the groups director of financial control the group cash manager and their main managers

     in this context the group holds floating rate notes with a nominal value of e161 million since 2012 these notes were issued by
     channel link enterprises finance clef the securitisation vehicle for the groups debt these notes have the same
     characteristics as the groups tranche c debt namely a maturity between 2041 and 2050 see note q to the consolidated financial
     statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document this acquisition improves the groups financial results

     as indicated in note x to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document the company
     has carried out a specific review of its liquidity risk and considers that it is able to meet its future obligations

     as indicated in section 106 of this registration document at 31 december 2015 the group was in compliance with its debt
     service cover ratios financial covenants

     as indicated in section 101 of this registration document get se received a baa2 rating from moodys in 2007 which is still valid
     at the date of this registration document


     f commodities and energy risks
     risk identification
     for the fixed link the eurotunnel group uses electricity as its main source of energy particularly for train traction the supply of
     electricity represents a significant expense for the eurotunnel group accounting for about 5 of overall operating expenditure in
     2015 and an overall major increase in the cost of commodities and electricity could impact the groups results

     the europorte entities favour the use of electrical power where these subsidiaries use diesel locomotives the cost price of
     traction may be affected by a change in the fuel price


     risk monitoring and management
     in the light of the highly volatile energy market the group has in place a risk management policy to hedge market price risk and
     volume risk




10   2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se

                                                                                                            risk factors                 4

application of the french law on the new organisation of electricity markets nome helps reduce the groups exposure to energy
market volatility

volume purchases on the british wholesale market are performed under annual contracts purchases are made in tranches to
spread the risk based on fundamental and technical market analysis

to mitigate volume risk the group closely monitors its electricity use and regularly updates its forecasts

the volume constraints imposed by electricity suppliers are negotiated in the power supply contracts to reduce the groups
volume risk by including the option of changing contractual volumes without penalty or by adding a takeorpay clause based on
an annual rather than seasonal timeframe

for europorte ways of mitigating the risk arising from the increase in fuel prices are being explored


g risk on shares and other financial instruments
risk identification
the operational cash flow of the subsidiaries is invested in shortterm and liquid investments in order to manage liquidity risks


risk monitoring and management
the groups investments are governed by its treasury policy and are therefore limited to the list of financial instruments detailed in
shortterm investments above and the floating rate notes mentioned in liquidity risk above the group does not invest in
shares interest rate instruments or other derivatives

these limits allow to manage the risk of default by a given issuer based on the average credit rating of all the bonds of that issuer
companies states stateowned companies and agencies and account for all of the groups exposures the group ensures that
these limits are complied with through specific governance each month the risk management committee checks that the
exposure is maintained within the acceptable limits and determines the actions to be taken in case of excessive concentration risk
the work done is are reported yearly to the audit committee


414 risks related to retirement benefits

risk identification
in the united kingdom the eurotunnel group administers three defined benefit pension schemes
 the main pension scheme the channel tunnel group pension fund which changed in 2010 from a wholly defined benefit plan
    to a hybrid scheme part defined benefit and part defined contribution
 a pension fund for gbrf and
 a historical defined benefit plan senior executive pension fund open only to senior managers who joined prior to 2000

an independent actuary values the schemes assets and liabilities the current value of the schemes assets which are not due to
be realised in the short term may undergo significant changes related to market developments

were the values of the schemes assets and liabilities to reveal underfunding the eurotunnel group could be asked to fund the
shortfall within the framework of a plan extending over a period of up to 10 years a deficit was recorded when the channel tunnel
group pension fund value was last determined in 2013 the group had to set up a recovery plan for e2 million per year for a
10year period


risk monitoring and management
risks associated with the uk pension schemes are managed through a regular review process and meetings with the trustees
actuaries and other professional advisers


415 risks related to the political environment

political environment
risk identification
as mentioned in paragraph 621 of this registration document in 2015 europe faced a strong surge of migration the eurotunnel
group has had to face the consequences of this with the strong increased migratory flow in the calais area and the resulting




                                                                         2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se               11

4    risk factors

     increase in intrusion attempts on to the site that has led to delays suspension of services and loss of revenues also such a risk
     could tarnish the groups image corporate social acceptability and the values it stands for


     risk monitoring and management
     major measures have been implemented to ensure the security of the site in response to this situation and continue to be
     enhanced deployment of highsecurity fencing increased number of guards coordination with the french railways that is in
     charge of ensuring the security of the calaisfrethun site support from the governmental authorities and the installation of new
     cameras the coquelles site now has a highlevel of protection following a major investment programme and the support of both
     the french and the british states who are in charge of border controls the group plans to continue to enhance the security over
     the long term


     416 risks related to extreme weather events

     risk identification
     the shuttle service unlike the ferries is unaffected by sea conditions and is not dependent on the weather however the
     occurrence of events related to extreme weather conditions such as major storms or heavy snowfall can make road networks
     impassable thus preventing customers from accessing the fixed link such events could also disrupt the functioning of the fixed
     link infrastructure reducing its operating capacity or even leading to its temporary closure extreme weather events can also have
     an impact on the rail companies using the fixed link and on essential service providers or supply networks that are indispensable
     for the operation of the fixed link electricity water roads fuel etc finally they can also affect rail freight transport activities or
     the financial situation of their customers thus extreme weather events can affect the groups business and impact its revenue


     risk monitoring and management
     for the concession the eurotunnel group has onsite weather stations to forecast these events moreover operational continuity
     plans ensure the continuity of operations in degraded mode for a given period in such cases the group also has management
     plans for road traffic in the vicinity of the terminals


     417 risks linked to terrorist threats and attacks

     risk identification
     the eurotunnel group constantly faces the risk of a terrorist threat or attack on its installations particularly the fixed link or on
     neighbouring infrastructure required for circulation of the trains or shuttles this risk is all the greater in the wake of the terrorist
     attacks in 2015 the eurotunnel group carries out activities on behalf of the states and consequently must implement security and
     public health measures along with specific measures for the application of national programmes such as the vigipirate security
     alert system in accordance with the concession agreement the eurotunnel group adapts its operational practices to meet these
     requirements and to deliver the required quality of service it is not possible to rule out a change in these requirements that would
     make it necessary for the group to adapt its business and commercial practices leading to an increase in operating costs or
     deterioration in service quality which could have an adverse effect on the groups image competitive advantages activity
     financial position or results irrespective of the insurance cover in place see section 43 below and government responsibilities if
     this risk were to materialise it could have a significant adverse impact on the business revenue and image of the eurotunnel
     group in addition safety and security measures could be tightened which could increase inconvenience caused to passengers
     reduce capacity and substantially increase the groups safety and securityrelated expenditure


     risk monitoring and management
     risk management procedures related to the risk of terrorism have been set up centrally by the group in coordination with the
     authorities armed forces border police etc under the supervision of the french and british governments


     418 risks related to health epidemics

     risk identification
     in the european and global health context the outbreak of an epidemic or the fear of an epidemic are likely to have a negative
     impact on traffic leading to a fall in revenue andor an increase in costs linked to public health measures

                                                                                                             risk factors                 4

risk monitoring and management
for the implementation of its operational continuity plans particularly with regard to operation of the concession the eurotunnel
group has a crisis management organisation in charge of deciding on any operational adjustments that may be required working
closely and continuously with the authorities entrusted with governmental responsibilities


419 risk of harm to image andor reputation

risk identification
the group may be exposed to reputational risks particularly when the groups values or operational excellence are questioned or
when its legitimacy as an infrastructure manager or transport operator is challenged the exposure to these criticisms may tarnish
the groups image and reputation such publicity could adversely affect the groups business revenues image and development
prospects

the flow of migrants around calais increased sharply in 2015 their management and that of border controls fall under the
responsibility of the governments the migrant crisis could impact the business of crosschannel operators including the fixed
link and tarnish the image of the short straits and the calais area and consequently risk customer disaffection the resulting
disruption could affect the british supply chain which demonstrates the critical importance of the fixed link

furthermore in relation to its development the group could face opposition from local communities or organisations to the
installation or operation of certain types of equipment or the setting up of new activities deterioration in these conditions could
result in permits and licences being refused or delayed and have a negative impact on the groups business


risk monitoring and management
as a player whose reputation and stakes have a national even european impact the eurotunnel group is attentive to early
warning signs from stakeholders and that could damage its image andor reputation the group is aware that its behaviour as a
binational company is subject to close scrutiny in a demanding political economic and social context it embraces its status as a
socially responsible business and upholds its values of safety security and quality of service in its organisation and its procedures
and spares no effort to prevent operational risks from occurring as well as early warning signs

the eurotunnel group engages in broad consultation upstream of its projects builds partnerships with civil society and ensures
that its activities generate economic benefits consistent with the expectations of the communities




42 risks related to the eurotunnel groups conduct
of business

421 risks related to external growth development and
investment in the groups business

risk identification
external growth
as part of its development strategy the eurotunnel group has pursued in the past and may pursue in the future external growth
through acquisitions such transactions involve a certain number of risks related to their implementation the integration of the
newly acquired activities and personnel failure to generate expected synergies to maintain uniform controls procedures and
policies the appearance of unexpected costs or liabilities applicable regulations or authorisations required the eurotunnel group
may be forced to dispose of businesses or limit the growth of certain activities in order to obtain the authorisations required for
operations including under competition law especially in case of divergence of interpretation between the french and british
authorities as indicated in section 427 of this registration document consequently the expected benefits of acquisitions may
not be realised in the timeframe and the expected levels in 2015 the eurotunnel group had to cease its maritime activity on
10 june 2015 reached an agreement with the dfds group for a bareboat charter of two ferries the berlioz and the rodin as
indicated in section 625 of this registration document the implementation of this agreement could involve steps and expenses
as well as a risk of a claim this bareboat charter agreement includes a put option to purchase the two ferries the berlioz and
the rodin




                                                                         2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se                13

4    risk factors

     investments
     in order to maintain its quality of service the eurotunnel group has decided to increase the capacity of its truck shuttle service
     with the purchase of three new truck shuttles which will be delivered from the end of 2016 given the time required to build and
     commission these complex elements the capital expenditure must be planned several years before they are put into service the
     length of the investment cycle carries risks for the expected return on past investments the uncertainties linked to this type of
     longterm investment could cause significant budget overruns

     as regards the eleclink project for the electricity interconnector in the channel tunnel the eurotunnel group bears a risk as a
     shareholder cost overruns and delays could affect the profitability of the project and the groups relationship with its partners
     such projects are usually complex and delays may occur or difficulties may arise in relation to design production and installation


     risk monitoring and management
     the acquisition and the integration of new businesses are subject to rigorous selection methods investments that exceed certain
     thresholds are also submitted to a grouplevel investment committee in charge of analysing the risks or as the case may be to the
     board of directors

     in order to maximise control over any significant overruns in the budget investments are closely and constantly monitored


     422 operational risks

     a   operational risks inherent in rail transport and infrastructure operation


     maintenance
     risk identification
     the eurotunnel group has more than 20 years of experience in maintaining its rolling stock equipment and infrastructure it has a
     standard maintenance programme a longterm largescale maintenance programme as well as a rolling stock and equipment
     replacement plan as indicated in section 624 however given the specific nature of the fixed links rolling stock equipment and
     infrastructure the particular conditions of use in a salty environment cause of corrosion and intensity of their use as well as
     technological advances these programmes and plans may prove insufficient or unsuitable particularly in the event of premature
     obsolescence or an increase in technical faults this would lead to unforeseen costs or a partial or temporary service interruption
     which could affect the eurotunnel groups business financial position or results in addition the work to install highvoltage cables
     between france and england in the rail tunnel as part of the eleclink interconnector project may affect traffic


     risk monitoring and management
     the eurotunnel group has implemented standardisation and reconditioning programmes designed to reduce future maintenance
     needs and improve the availability of its rolling stock the impact of the new industrial solutions introduced to improve operating
     performance may be hard to master and could lead to temporary disruptions to services


     safety of employees and subcontractors
     risk identification
     during the repair or maintenance of its systems technical incidentsaccidents may jeopardise the safety of eurotunnel group
     employees and subcontractors and accordingly with the risk of a claim against eurotunnel group or of its legal representatives in
     particular regarding an accident at work due to the evolution of legal standards and case law towards greater protection of
     victims the causes of these accidents can be recognised before the relevant court as being events giving rise to civil or criminal
     liability of the group its subsidiaries andor the delegates concerned resulting in a civil or criminal conviction with a corresponding
     impact on the groups image


     risk monitoring and management
     the eurotunnel group is committed to implementing all safety plans necessary to ensure the wellbeing of all persons working on
     its sites


     safety
     risk identification
     with regard to past incidents the occurrence of another major fire would result in a substantial increase in the insurance premiums
     whilst the effectiveness of the safe stations and the salamander plan reduces the impact of this historical risk they cannot
     reduce the likelihood of recurrence

risk monitoring and management
safetyrelated and fire risks in the tunnel are covered by the design of the system itself and by a series of principles procedures
and controls that have been validated by the igc

the group regularly monitors innovations in fire detection and prevention systems the group also takes into account the fact that
these risks could come from external entities using the groups facilities and therefore as part of its policy to improve safety and
service quality it owns dedicated rescue locomotives


security
risk identification
the flow of migrants around calais increased sharply in 2015

the continuing trend of increasing numbers of migrants could require the investment of additional resources or deteriorate the
fluidity the capacity and thus the quality of service which could affect the performance in this business as well as the security of
employees and clients


risk monitoring and management
concerning risks related to security the eurotunnel group continues to implement intrusion prevention measures and to improve
the detection of concealed people on trucks transported


europorte
risk identification
the current state of the rolling stock market requires europorte in france to place orders to buy andor lease long before they are
produced and brought into service creating the risk that the market offering may be inappropriate to europortes needs when the
time comes this could affect europortes ability to fulfil its commitments in a timely manner on the british side rolling stock that
meets european and national regulations is increasingly difficult to obtain which could hold back gbrfs development


risk monitoring and management
europorte is seeking to optimise its current rolling stock fleet and is implementing a policy to anticipate requirements in advance


b risk attached to the activities of the railways and railway companies
risk identification
the railways business being the groups principal customer could have a significant impact on the groups financial situation
the tunnel is used by highspeed passenger train services and train operators rail freight services whose results could be
affected by external events and circumstances beyond the control of the eurotunnel group the eurotunnel group does not
operate these services and cannot exert direct influence on the commercial operation of highspeed passenger train services or
the train operators rail freight services the performance service level capacities and prices offered by these operators to their
customers along with other factors that may be beyond the operators control influence the use of their services which in turn
may affect the revenue that the eurotunnel group receives from the railways and railway companies the train operators rail
freight services face organisational problems relating to coordination of national operators regulatory or labour constraints
specific to the rail sector technical constraints of the rail network lines used and the priority of freight versus passenger traffic on
infrastructures within the european union these barriers to development could make it hard to achieve significant growth in the
volumes transported by the train operators rail freight services and could even lead to a substantial decline in traffic a
significant portion of the eurotunnel groups revenue therefore depends on the successful operation of these services by entities
over which it has no control

the railway facilities used by the highspeed passenger train services and rail freight trains are outside the scope of the
eurotunnel groups concession and could be subject to disruption from various sources this could result in the stoppage or
reduction of this traffic as was the case in 2015 on the sncf railways calais frethun site such events could have a negative
impact on the groups revenue derived from the usage of its railway network

railway companies are faced with the risk of shrinking markets in the current context of the european migrant crisis and terrorist
threats that could entail a change in the passengers behaviour a risk that could lead to loss of revenues for the eurotunnel group
this risk is difficult to control as it is external to the railway companies and the eurotunnel group given that it depends on
geopolitical conditions




                                                                          2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se                 15

4    risk factors

     risk monitoring and management
     the risk inherent to the business and development of railways is mainly external to the group as it does not have actual control
     over the activities of the railways and railway companies nevertheless the pricing framework of the railways usage contrat
     concession agreement defined in the network statement aims to offer an efficient stable and incentive access for the growth of
     the railways companies in parallel cooperative initiatives and communication actions are conducted regularly with railway
     companies arafer orr and ministers in order for them to understand and reduce the barriers to growth

     for the disruptions affecting the railway facilities used by rail freight trains and mainly resulting from the increase of migrants in the

     the eurotunnel group


     423 risks related to human resources

     skills
     risk identification
     the groups business encompasses a wide range of occupations calling on a variety of skills in the context of an inverted age
     pyramid for the fixed link the replacement of some staff and potential retraining plans are areas managed by the groups human
     resources department the eurotunnel group has therefore increased its forward planning in terms of skills management and the
     transfer of knowhow

     calling for a broad spectrum of requirements particularly in terms of safety technical expertise and psychological aptitude
     occupations in the rail industry require lengthy training staff shortages and the difficulty of replacement within existing teams
     including the management team connected with stiff competition among the various operators could affect developments


     risk monitoring and management
     in order to anticipate the risk of the loss of key skills or the growing scarcity of workers for certain jobs the group is pursuing a
     human resources policy that is highly oriented towards forwardlooking job management adapted to different contexts and on the
     encouragement of employability through the development of training as indicated in chapter 17 below faced with the absence of
     government training programmes leading to qualifications in the rail sector the group has set up an organisation dedicated to rail
     industry training courses in addition in order to retain its key employees and motivate their performance the group has
     introduced longterm incentives and a free share scheme for all group employees


     labour relations
     risk identification
     in the current climate the risk of deteriorating labour relations and staff disputes cannot be ruled out strikes walkouts industrial
     action or other forms of unrest could disrupt the activities of the eurotunnel group such events could occur not only within the
     eurotunnel group but could also affect its customers subcontractors or suppliers developments within the group could mean
     that consultation and negotiation no longer effectively regulate relations between management and staff in the event of a
     breakdown in the negotiation process those relations could deteriorate leading to loss of motivation and trust among employees
     and affecting the groups external and internal image

     the group has already implemented restructuring and reorganisation in the past further measures cannot be completely ruled out
     in the future reorganisation could affect the groups relations with its employees giving rise to labour disputes and specifically
     stoppages strikes and other forms of disruption that could have a negative effect on the groups business and results


     risk monitoring and management
     labourrelated risk management procedures are described in section 172 of this registration document


     quality of working life
     risk identification
     in the prevailing economic and political climate the group may be affected by psychosocial risks in view of the sharp rise in
     migrants intrusion attempts on the fixed link site during summer 2015 the group is particularly sensitive to acute psychosocial
     risk of workrelated stress for the employees

and its results are regularly shared through internal communication which fosters cohesion

at the beginning of july 2015 when the migrants intrusion attempts increased on the coquelles site the health hygiene security
and working conditions committee chsct decided to initially put in place a psychological team to help its mostexposed staff
train drivers were the first to have access to health specialists both day and night and subsequently a special number was set up
for all staff in august the eurotunnel group increased the size of the psychological team to all of its employees working on the
fixed links site owing to the intrusion attempts by migrants seeking to go over to the united kingdom group talk sessions were
held two or three times a week and overseen by nurses and a psychologist to listen to staff talk about their uneasiness to prevent
them having to face the situation on their own in conditions which could have psychological repercussions


424 risks related to defaulting suppliers or subcontractors

a defaulting subcontractors
risk identification
the eurotunnel group relies on subcontractors for parts of its business particularly relating to security cleaning primarily
industrial and vehicle chocking it is possible that some of these subcontractors might fail to fulfil their obligations which could
affect the eurotunnel groups results or financial position


risk monitoring and management
subcontractor default risk is managed through the purchasing departments careful supplier selection procedure as well as
through the monitoring of suppliers financial position and close contract management


b defaulting suppliers
risk identification
fixed link
the rolling stock and some of the fixed link installations have been supplied in very small volumes by a very limited number of
suppliers to meet highly specific operating requirements the eurotunnel group believes that if its original suppliers were unable to
supply replacement parts or whole shuttles for any reason or were unwilling to do so on acceptable terms it would be able to
obtain the necessary equipment from other manufacturers however the price or timeframe for such replacements could have an
adverse impact on the eurotunnel groups financial position and prospects


europorte
for europorte the need to lease new locomotives in coming years brings an increased risk of reliance on key suppliers

the allocation by sncf reseau of poor quality train paths or the unavailability of train paths could harm europortes image and
affect its business


risk monitoring and management
fixed link
equipment and materials risk is managed through the purchase of reserve stocks the dynamic annual or halfyearly review of
suppliers and research into alternative equipment and technologies


europorte
on 22 january 2013 europorte signed a framework agreement with reseau            ferre de france on the infrastructure capacity
required for the rail company to operate in addition to a new agreement on train path quality for the service timetable covered by
the deal the sncf reseau agreed to confirm or withdraw freight paths at least two months before the service is scheduled to run

     425 environmental risks

     risk identification
     the concessionaires are subject to french english and european environmental regulations as well as local regulations that
     require them to either obtain authorisation for the disposal of certain waste materials or contract an accredited company to remove
     and dispose of the waste any breach of the environmental regulations would result in them being fined for causing pollution the
     regulations also stipulate that the authorities may force the closure of any facility that does not comply with decisions requiring
     certain environmentally harmful activities to cease or be modified

     the eurotunnel group has an environmental protection and sustainable development policy which is described in chapter 17 of
     this registration document however there is no guarantee that the united kingdom french european national or local
     authorities will not impose new regulations leading to additional expenditure which could have an adverse impact on the results or
     financial position of the eurotunnel group due to the nature of its activities and its potential new projects or developments the
     eurotunnel group while being attentive to compliance with the applicable environmental regulations could experience delays in
     these developments because of possible constraints or claims

     as a local development player the group may be subject to the risk of litigation or claims from environmental protection
     associations as is the case with the dispute brought before the administrative court of lille by the environment defense
     association of peuplingues and sangatte against the decision of the prefect which approved the eleclink project

     risk monitoring and management
     these risks are closely managed as stated in chapter 17 of this registration document managed through an environmental
     analysis which identifies the various risks and assesses their potential impact the resources required to minimise this impact can
     then be identified the regulations outline the risks associated with some activities carried out at the terminals and specify
     requirements for reducing and monitoring their impact

     in the united kingdom the concessionaires as managers of an infrastructure of major importance to the british economy were
     required by the department for environment food and rural affairs defra under the 2008 climate change act to carry out a
     study of the ability of its infrastructure to withstand the foreseeable effects of climate change


     426 societal acceptability

     the industrial sites and areas in which europorte operates and the products transported present a risk in terms of the environment
     and industrial safety
     risk identification
     the main customers of socorail the europorte subsidiary specialising in the provision of industrial logistical services include
     actors from the chemical and oil industries subject to the seveso classification these industries are subject to very strict safety
     regulations therefore extremely stringent safety criteria are imposed on subcontractors although socorail has for several years
     been engaged in a voluntary process of iso 9001 2008 quality certification and mase business safety improvement manual
     safety certification the danger toxicity or flammability of some raw materials could cause risks particularly risks of accidents
     fires explosions and damage to the environment and wildlife and could harm the environmental image of europorte and the
     group the same applies when europortes rail freight subsidiaries transport various hazardous toxic or flammable products
     furthermore the business of rail freight haulage may present environmental risks in the event of a rail accident due to the materials
     transported or the zones crossed


     risk monitoring and management
     the industrial safety and environmental risk prevention policy is described in section 1721 and 1741 of this registration

427 legal risks

a risks related to legislation and regulation specific to the eurotunnel groups activity
risks related to the regulation specific to the groups activity
risk identification
the eurotunnel group operates in a highly regulated environment which results in a high degree of dependency on decisions and
measures over which the group has very little or no influence these regulations are subject to change and interpretation by
administrative authorities and courts and could be considerably tightened by national or european authorities which would
adversely affect the groups business activities and financial results compliance with the rules in their current form and as
amended in the future could result in increased operating and investment costs for the group to ensure compliance with such
regulatory changes as an example tightening the measures taken to enforce the regulations governing immigration customs and
excise duty could cause delays or affect customer satisfaction levels the relevant authorities could also adopt other stricter rules
or rules in new areas that are not currently considered with similar effect


risk monitoring and management
the eurotunnel group is aware of the strong legal and regulatory framework in which it operates and seeks as far as possible to
conduct communication actions and measures to safeguard the groups interests with the concerned players

i   risks related to the regulation specific to the fixed links activity


risk identification
the regulatory framework of the fixed link business includes the european rail directives particularly directive 200114ec which
relates both to the division of rail infrastructure capacity and the pricing of rail infrastructure and specifies operating rules
applicable to rail infrastructure managers this regulatory framework is constantly changing the provisions of the recast directive
on the first railway package 201234eu need to be transposed to the channel tunnel with an economic regulation which will be

side and the office of rail regulation orr on the british side which could lead to a risk of conflict the interpretation by these
two separate national authorities may have an impact on the pricing of rail infrastructure and consequently on fixed link
revenues the draft fourth railway package could affect the operation and financial position of the concessionaires as a result of
the proposed strengthened separation of the infrastructure manager and rail company activities as well as the intragroup
financing flows these measures could impose restrictions on the eurotunnel groups business activities and affect its revenue
these directives can also be subject to change and interpretation by administrative authorities and courts and the associated
regulations could even be significantly tightened by national or european authorities

operation of the tunnel is subject to highly detailed regulations drawn up by the igc and the safety authority the concession
agreement described in chapter 22 of this registration document may be terminated by the two states in the event of force
majeure particularly in the event of war or a serious breach by the concessionaires of their obligations under the concession
agreement furthermore if the eurotunnel group should be in breach of its obligations under the concession agreement the igc
could impose significant daily penalties the igc has the power to take decisions such as in relation to the current headway
between trains using the tunnel that could lead to a reduction in tunnel capacity the regulatory authorities could also adopt new
measures relating to safety security or other matters particularly concerning infrastructure access conditions or more specifically
the development of more rigorous border controls given the current heightened sensitivity to terrorism in accordance with the
united kingdom governments new immigration act 2014 the eurotunnel group is now controlling passports of passengers who
leave the united kingdom since 8 april 2015 the eurotunnel group is working with the government of the united kingdom to
minimise the impact of these new controls on the traffic flows on the folkestone terminal these measures may be reinforced
which may deteriorate the quality of service and customer satisfaction this could force the eurotunnel group to incur significant
additional expenditure or could impose restrictions on its business activities and impact its revenue

the concession agreement under which the eurotunnel group operates may only be modified through amendments negotiated
with the two states these negotiations could be long and complex were economic financial or technical developments affecting
the eurotunnel group to make rapid adjustments necessary the specific terms of the concession agreement could limit the
eurotunnel groups ability to adapt or to adjust its business to those developments which could affect its results and financial
position

     responsible for economic regulation of the fixed link as well as the national and european lawmakers

     the eurotunnel group has no control over the igc which represents the two governments including the minister of transport in
     respect of france and the department for transport regarding the united kingdom in addition the eurotunnel group has no
     control over the araf or the orr however the obligations under the concession agreement require the states to adopt a
     specific behavior in the exercise of their functions the concessionaires have the option of requesting compensation on the
     grounds of a breach of contract particularly in the context of the implementation of their international undertakings before the
     arbitral tribunal provided for in the treaty of canterbury

     ii    risks related to the regulation specific to europortes activity


     risk identification
     in france and in the united kingdom the costs of access to the national rail network are high the increase in such costs andor a
     reduction of government funding could impact europortes financial results a termination of funding would give rise to a marked
     increase in the operating costs of rail operators including epf and gbrf which would be likely to significantly disrupt the market
     and the pricing policy and to threaten the competitiveness of rail freight in the long term in great britain policies concerning
     financial assistance and subsidies have an impact on traffic particularly in the fields of biomass and intermodal transportation

     in the area of transport the public authorities are recommending the promotion and development of alternative modes of
     transport encouraging a modal shift from road to rail is one of the main levers of this policy yet frances secondary rail network
     which was historically very dense has been neglected and following a lack of maintenance and use is gradually being
     dismantled however this network is essential to the survival of rail freight since it allows a large part of freight flows to be
     channelled into the main network without political will on the part of the actors responsible for developing transport infrastructure
     and the implications of that lack of political will for the modal shift strategy the progressive deterioration or eventual disappearance
     of the feeder networks could have a major impact on the revenue of epf the railway reform act of 4 august 2014 may compromise
     the independence of management of the french rail network and the impartiality of train paths

     the plan to harmonise the conditions of employment of railway workers both freight and passenger is one of the objectives of the
     draft railway reform it is anticipated that a foundation decree will set the common rules regarding organisation and working time
     guaranteeing the requirements of safety and continuity of public services and that the decree will be supplemented by a
     sectorwide collective agreement the drafting of which has been entrusted to a joint committee composed of the french public
     and rail transport union and seven trade union organisations the establishment of a harmonised labour framework for the whole
     rail sector could affect the social equilibrium of the company and adversely affect the competitiveness of europorte


     risk monitoring and management
     in view of the exogenous risks arising from changes in the contributions allocated by the french and british states and the
     implementation of a harmonised labour framework in france the group undertakes all possible communication and defence
     actions with the relevant players

     epf epc and gbrf operate under rail freight operators licences these activities may only commence on the infrastructure after
     approval of the safety documentation and issuance of a safety certificate by the competent authority furthermore in order to
     obtain authorisation to transport certain hazardous materials on a given infrastructure a safety plan is submitted and endorsed by
     the manager of the relevant infrastructure

     iii   risks related to competition regulation


     risk identification
     the eurotunnel groups market pricing practices and behaviour are governed by competition law the application of which is
     supervised by the french and british competition authorities and the european commission this could give rise to the
     introduction of new regulatory measures concerning prices penalties thirdparty proceedings for damages and restrictions on
     the groups business activities these or other measures could have a significant negative impact on the eurotunnel groups
     financial position particularly in the case of divergent interpretations of a given operation by the french authority and the british
     authority


     risk monitoring and management
     the groups management of legal risks is carefully monitored by several departments and in particular by the groups legal
     department through a monitoring procedure and meetings with the relevant operational departments

     risk identification
     the eurotunnel group is now and could be in the future involved in certain administrative or judicial proceedings the most
     significant current or potential proceedings are described in section 208 of this registration document

     more generally it cannot be ruled out that in the future new legal proceedings whether related to ongoing proceedings or not
     could be brought against any of the eurotunnel groups entities or their legal representations were such proceedings to have an
     unfavourable outcome they could have an adverse impact on the business financial position or results of the eurotunnel group

systems cloud computing and new uses by employees bring your own device use of collaboration tools access to social
networks and mobility attacks via the internet are increasingly complex targeted attacks and numerous at the same time the
groups activities and processes are increasingly dependent on information systems information system failures could result in
the loss or leakage of information delays or additional costs posing a risk to the groups strategy or image


risk monitoring and management
these risks are addressed through functional technical and legal security measures securing smartphones automatic detection
of security vulnerabilities on group servers annual intrusion tests and so on system redundancy contingency plans and recovery
plans are in place for strategic systems moreover the concessionaires that generate a large part of their revenue online are
subject to particular audit and control obligations in terms of information system security new obligations in matters of cyber

43 insurance

risk identification
the eurotunnel groups insurance programmes consist primarily of policies covering material damage and business interruption
including terrorism and thirdparty liability

for the fixed link the material damage and business interruption policy including terrorism is composed of two layers of
e400 million and e300 million respectively providing total cover of e700 million the first layer was renegotiated and renewed on
1 january 2015 for a period of three years ending on 31 december 2017 the second layer was renewed on 1 january 2016 for a
period of one year ending on 31 december 2016 premiums are paid annually

the eurotunnel groups thirdparty liability policy excluding specific programmes was renewed on 1 january 2015 for three years
ending 31 december 2017

the dedicated insurance programme for epf epp and socorail which was already in place has been renewed for the period
1 december 2015 to 30 november 2016 it includes cover for material damage and business interruption thirdparty liability and
environmental damage

in certain circumstances payments by insurance companies under existing insurance guarantees may not be sufficient to cover all
of the loss suffered losses in excess of the agreed indemnity limits or the application of deductibles or certain exclusion clauses
could result in the eurotunnel group incurring unforeseen costs or could affect its business financial position or results

in addition changes to the insurance market and the occurrence of operational incidents could lead to an adverse change in the
eurotunnel groups insurance programme and the terms and conditions of such insurance such as the level of premiums the level
of insurance deductibles and the scope of any exclusions which could have an adverse impact on the eurotunnel groups
business financial position or results

515 important events in the development of the business of get se

cessation of the maritime activity
in july 2012 eurotunnel purchased three ferries the berlioz the rodin and the nord pasdecalais as part of the asset disposal
procedure conducted by the french tribunal de commerce following the liquidation of seafrance and subcontracted the
operation of the ferries to an independent company scop seafrance

following the decision by the competition appeal tribunal on 9 january 2015 to uphold the prohibition for the eurotunnel group to
operate any vessel out of the port of dover from 9 july 2015 the group announced its intention to withdraw from its maritime
activity and to find a buyer for its three ferries the decision of the competition appeal tribunal was upheld on 16 december 2015
by the supreme court

during 2015 the process of the groups withdrawal from its maritime activity was as follows
 on 10 june 2015 the eurotunnel group reached an agreement with the dfds group in relation to two of the ferries the berlioz
   and the rodin due to the condition imposed at the time of their purchase in 2012 prohibiting the sale of the ferries for a period
   of five years the agreement provides for the leasing of the two ferries from the date of their definitive delivery to dfds with an
   option for their subsequent sale the eurotunnel group is studying the possibility of requesting the paris tribunal de commerce
   to lift the prohibition to sell
 on 1st july 2015 myferrylink ceased commercial operations following the nonrenewal of the contracts between the
   eurotunnel group and scop seafrance
 having been occupied by staff of the scop seafrance until the beginning of september the rodin and the berlioz were only
   handed over to dfds on 15 september 2015 since then the two ferries have been undergoing rehabilitation works and were
   finally delivered to dfds on 9 and 11 february 2016 respectively enabling the start of their finance leases
 as a result of the decision by the supreme court in december 2015 the group has been forced to definitively cease its
   maritime activity and has announced its intention to dispose of the nord pasdecalais

taking into account these events the group believes that during the second half of 2015 the conditions were met for the
application of ifrs 5 noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations to the maritime activity the activities of the
myferrylink segment are presented in the financial statements as follows
 the ferries berlioz rodin and nord pasdecalais are treated as assets held for sale and are presented on a separate line of the
   statement of financial position as at 31 december 2015 with no reclassification of the comparative statement of financial
   position as at 31 december 2014
 the net result of the maritime segment for both the current and the comparative financial years are presented on a single line in
   the income statement entitled net loss from discontinued operations
 net cash flows from operating investment and financing activities arising from these discontinued operations for the current
   and the comparative financial years are included in the groups consolidated cash flow statement

financial information relating to the myferrylink segment is presented in note d to the financial statements in paragraph 2031 of

that securitised the groups debt that was put in place by the lenders in 2007 the consequences of this operation on the term
loan are set out in note v1 to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 2031 of this registration document

the costs incurred which amount to e123 million will be offset by a reduction in interest rates of 06 on some of the tranches of
the debt

this operation which has not led to a substantial modification of the conditions of the term loan has been treated in the groups
financial statements at 31 december 2015 as follows
 costs that are directly attributable to the operation have been accounted for as an adjustment to the carrying value of the a
    tranches of the term loan and will be amortised over the remaining period to maturity of these debts
 consent fees of e175 million which are not directly attributable to the modification of tranche a of the term loan have been
    accounted for on the income statement at 31 december 2015 under other financial charges
 the part of the transaction fees paid in 2015 amounted to e42 million e175 million of which were consent fees

     migrant impact
     in the context of the high concentration of migrants in the calais area the group with the support of the french and british
     authorities has taken and continues to take the measures necessary to ensure the continuity of its services and the availability of
     its installations these measures have incurred substantial capital expenditure and additional security costs for the fixed link
     segment during the 2015 financial year the resources involved are either supplied directly by the governments themselves or are
     financed by the eurotunnel group and partly reimbursed by the governments the net impact on operating costs for the 2015
     financial year is e7 million

     the group has also submitted a claim to the two governments via the intergovernmental commission relating to revenue lost as a
     result of the disruptions caused by the intrusions by the migrants during the year no revenue has been accounted for this during
     the 2015 financial year

     52 investments

     521 significant investments made by the eurotunnel group during
     the last three years and significant current investments

     the total amount of the eurotunnel groups investments in the last three years is respectively e74382000 for the 2013 financial
     year e140630000 for the 2014 financial year and e139988000 for the 2015 financial year

     over the last three financial years the eurotunnel groups main investments in the fixed link were
      the terminal 2015 project approximately e30 million an ambitious programme to develop the truck shuttle activity which
       aims to increase capacity by improving the management of the flow of trucks by the addition of a buffer storage area to enable a
       quick transit as well as increased access at checkin in folkestone the terminal 2015 project includes the creation of new
       lanes before checkin and new checkin booths the capacity to accommodate trucks will increase with the construction of a
       secured parking area at coquelles
      the installation of the gsmr approximately e40 million since the beginning of the project including e25 million over the last
       three years
      the installation of highsecurity fences on the terminal on the french side which is reimbursable by the governments
      the replacement of rails in the tunnel approximately e20 million
      the entry into service of the gsmp in the north tunnel which is an important element in improving the offer to customers by
       enabling them to use mobile communications services from french or british telecoms operators whilst in the tunnel on
       shuttles and passenger trains approximately e6 million
      the floor renovations on the arbel and breda truck shuttles approximately e6 million
      the replacement of couplings on the rolling stock approximately e4 million

     over the last three financial years the eurotunnel groups investments in the europorte segment totalled approximately
     e186 million mainly related to the purchase of rolling stock for purposes of the ongoing rationalisation of the locomotive fleet
     notably locomotives for europorte france and gb railfreight


     522 significant future investments

     investment projects planned for 2016 fall into three categories those undertaken in response to outside constraints those to
     replace existing equipment before it becomes obsolete and those to improve the groups performance each project has a level of
     flexibility in terms of scope and phasing which may be adjusted as circumstances change

     in the current economic environment and given the risk of increased competition in the crosschannel market these investments
     are for the most part essential to sustaining the competitiveness and market shares of the eurotunnel groups activities

the projects imposed by external constraints are aimed on the one hand to adapt the security of the sites of the fixed link to the
migratory context in calais in order to preserve the quality of service and on the other hand to meet the regulatory constraints
involved in sustainable development

the plan to secure the fixed links sites which started in 2015 and will continue in 2016 includes
 the redevelopment of the area of uk border controls and the creation of reservoirs to increase the storage capacity of the trucks
   prior to the border controls and to increase controls
 the installation of mobile detection scanners on the passenger terminals and a scanner at the frethun      yard
 the refilling of ditches and marshes and planting of defensive hedges around the perimeter of the site and
 the creation of a track dedicated to a search area for truck shuttles which is protected from electrical hazards

two major projects which are required to meet environmental regulations and which form part of the groups sustainable
development are currently
 the replacement of chillers for the tunnel cooling plants and air conditioning systems using r22 gas the handling of which has
   been prohibited since 1 january 2015 and
 the replacement of the fireextinguishing gas halon 1301 a contributor to the depletion of the ozone layer used in firefighting
   systems onboard locomotives in the service tunnel and in buildings on the terminals

the project to equip the tunnel with gsmr continues and represents a total investment estimated at e48 million this project is to
meet obligations under the european directive on interoperability of the european networks and will allow the circulation of trains
run by new entrants including deutsche bahn

replacement projects in 2016 include the continued replacement of rails in the tunnel some track switches some catenary
equipment in the tunnel the floors of some truck shuttles couplings on the passenger shuttles locomotives and on truck shuttle
loader wagons in order to allow them to operate under optimum conditions of reliability safety and security

intensive use and the natural life cycle of rolling stock lead to deterioration in some of the wagon equipment to remedy this
several programmes to study modernisation and replacement have been launched such as on the passenger shuttle loader
wagons on the fire doors and on the air conditioning units

other projects are designed to boost the business performance capacity or productivity notably including the development plan
for the shuttle activities
 the end of the terminal 2015 project with the comprehensive redevelopment of the french and british truck shuttle terminals
    including equipping and developing the parking used by customers of the truck shuttle service
 the purchase and commissioning of three new truck shuttles this project which represents a total investment of
    approximately e61 million by 2018 is for the construction of three new truck shuttles each measuring 800 metres long and
    comprising 32 transport wagons three loading wagons and a carriage for the transportation of truck drivers these new truck
    shuttles will benefit from the latest technological advances in order to ensure both energy savings and also robustness and
    reliability delivery is expected from the end of 2016 and into 2017
 the redevelopment of the allocation areas and the construction of new buildings to welcome flexiplus customers to the
    french and british terminals

the eleclink project in which get se holds a 49 share has received the authorisations described in section 642 of this
registration document the investment required for this project will be financed by equity and debt raised by eleclink in
accordance with terms and conditions which have not yet been determined get ses current shareholding may be modified in the
future as the project evolves for the acquisition and as the case may be the resale of all or part of the 51 stake currently held by
star capital

61 introduction

get se the groups listed holding company controls the two channel tunnel concessionaires and europorte sas in relation to
rail freight transport activities and eurotransmanche holding sas in relation to ship rental and until july 2015 the sale of
crossings get se is also a partner for projects aimed at enhancing the value of the tunnel such as the electrical interconnection
between france and the united kingdom through its equity interest in eleclink ltd


the fixed link segment
the two concessionaires operate the tunnel in accordance with the treaty of canterbury and the concession agreement the
treaty of canterbury signed on 12 february 1986 authorised the construction and operation of the fixed link by private
concessionaire companies and established the framework of the concession agreement which was signed on 14 march 1986

under the terms of the concession agreement the states granted the concessionaires the right and obligation to design finance
build and operate the fixed link between france and the united kingdom without prejudice to the sovereign authority of the
states as regards police or border and territorial control the concession agreement will expire in 2086 the main provisions of the
treaty of canterbury and the concession agreement are described in chapter 22 of this registration document

the concessionaires operate the system which links france and the united kingdom and comprises three tunnels each
approximately 50 kilometres long which run mostly under the channel along with the folkestone terminal in the united kingdom
and the coquelles terminal in france the fixed equipment and related installations two of the tunnels are singletrack rail tunnels
which in normal service are used by trains travelling in one direction only the third tunnel which for most of its length runs between
the two main rail tunnels provides a safe means of emergency evacuation and access for tunnel maintenance there are also four
crossing points between the rail tunnels so that when maintenance work is being done on a section of one tunnel trains can
switch to the other

the system is directly linked to the british and french motorway networks with the folkestone and coquelles terminals the
departure and arrival points for vehicles using the shuttle services shopping and catering facilities are available to customers at
each terminal the system is also linked to the french and british railway networks in particular to their highspeed lines all rail
traffic in the system is controlled from railway control centres on the french and british terminals


the rail freight segment europorte
the holding company europorte sas groups all the rail freight transport subsidiaries europorte segment providing a wide range
of integrated rail freight services including national and international haulage local services for secondary lines and services to
industry individual junction management infrastructure maintenance and wagon loading and unloading

a company outside the eurotunnel group was responsible for the equipment and nautical management of the vessels on the sea
route between the ports of calais in france and dover in the united kingdom and which were marketed by the subsidiary
myferrylink sas

following the decision of the competition appeal tribunal of 9 january 2015 upheld by the supreme court on 16 december 2015
establishing the prohibition for the berlioz and rodin ferries to dock at the port of dover as of 9 july 2015 the group divested itself
of its maritime business and closed down the operations of the myferrylink segment on 29 june 2015 as a result this activity is

     62 crosschannel activities

     621 main markets

     the eurotunnel group operates in the transport market between continental europe and the united kingdom it offers i a shuttle
     service between calais and folkestone and which competes directly with ferry operators between dover and continental europe
     in the transport of passengers cars coaches and trucks and ii a railway network on which railway companies can run rail
     freight trains and highspeed passenger trains


     a freight market
     freight traffic between continental europe and the united kingdom is commonly divided into four distinct modes
      rollonrolloff accompanied trucks and trailers crossing the channel or the north sea on shuttles or ferries at the same time
        as the road tractor and driver mostly via the short straits
      rollonrolloff unaccompanied trailers crossing the channel or the north sea independently of the road tractor mostly via
        north sea routes
      rail freight conventional or intermodal trains running through the tunnel and
      liftonliftoff moveable containers or swap bodies loaded on liftonliftoff container ships mostly on the
        north sea routes

     the market is based on three corridors
      the short straits all routes from continental europe to dover folkestone and ramsgate including the tunnel
      the english channel all routes from continental europe to ports on the south coast of the united kingdom to southwest
        folkestone and
      the north sea all routes from continental europe to ports on the east coast of the united kingdom to the north of ramsgate
        including the thames estuary

     the modal distribution varies by geographic zone for accompanied trucks the long trip across the english channel or the even
     longer trip across the north sea is costly these routes are more suitable for rollonrolloff unaccompanied and liftonliftoff
     solutions

     by contrast the shorter crossing times of the short straits are more appropriate to timesensitive traffic and attract a much larger
     share of rollonrolloff accompanied traffic


     short straits
     in the freight market the truck shuttle service is in direct competition with ferry operators on the accompanied road transport
     route across the short straits

over the last 20 years there has been a marked shift towards the use of accompanied trucks in the freight market between
continental europe and the united kingdom the trend in favour of accompanied trucks has shifted and market shares between
the routes are now relatively stable

however the rollonrolloff accompanied mode on the short straits routes still continues to grow because it provides the
shortest and quickest route for crossing the channel

the short straits truck shuttles and ferries share of the freight market rose on the back of the success of the rollonrolloff
accompanied mode reflecting
 capacity increases and changes in pricing policies by the various operators and
 indirectly the absence of major development of the crosschannel railroad freight

the freight market continued to grow in 2015 at over 4 compared with the previous year reaching in the year 2015 a record high
for the overall short straits market despite the disruptions in the geopolitical scene in 2015

since 1st january 2015 pursuant to directive 200533ec of the parliament and the council of the european union which imposes
controlled emissions areas for sulphur covering the english channel the north sea and the baltic sea all ferry operators in the
north sea and the english channel must meet stricter limits on sulphur emissions and for that they have two alternatives
 the first solution is to choose a fuel with low sulphur content marine gas oil mgo and
 the second is to continue using fuels with high sulphur content such as heavy fuel oil hfo but to install equipment to clean
   pollutants from the exhaust gas exhaust gas separator filters or scrubbers the fall in oil prices over the 2015 financial year
   mitigated the impact of this directive for ferry companies


b passenger market
the international passenger transport market from and to the united kingdom grew steadily for several years after the return to
normality in 2008 the impact of the global economic environment largely reversed this trend between 2009 and 2012 since 2013
the passenger market has grown significantly year after year by 4 in 2013 compared to 2012 by 3 in 2014 compared to 2013
and with an estimated growth at end november 2015 of 7 compared to 20141

the passenger shuttle service carries passengers travelling with their vehicles between calais folkestone and dover it is in direct
competition with ferry operators in the short straits market the transport services for passengers travelling without their vehicles
provided by airlines or by highspeed passenger trains constitute a marginal and indirect source of competition to this service

eurostar services principally operate in the market for transporting passengers travelling without their vehicles between paris and
london and between brussels and london eurostars main competitors are airlines


short straits
while day trips have permanently declined following the end of dutyfree purchases and other economic benefits the number of
longstay five days and over and shortstay fewer than five days trips have increased as a result of
 the withdrawal of passenger services on other crosschannel routes which led to a transfer of traffic to the short straits
 the adoption of dynamic pricing by some operators particularly the eurotunnel group for its shuttle services
 airline pricing policies and an end to the steady fall in air fares and
 airport disruption and delays

in 2014 the short straits market rose by 15 compared to 2013 but in contrast to the international passenger transport market
as a whole the short straits market contracted by 27 in 2015 mainly in the second halfyear owing to problems arising from
intrusion attempts by migrants the impact of the terrorist attacks and the states of emergency declared in france and in belgium at
the end of the year


c competitive position in the short straits market
the shuttle services are in direct competition with the ferry services operated by po ferries and dfds seaways they compete
indirectly with airlines and to a lesser extent with eurostar


i   ferry operators
crosschannel ferry operators are using larger ships to handle greater volumes of traffic and to achieve economies of scale over
the long term looking for growth in the freight market rather than in the passenger market cars

     arrangements have been brought before the administrative court of justice by the eurotunnel group

     the port of dover plans to create a new terminal in the western docks to accommodate larger ferries

     following the withdrawal of hoverspeed in october 2005 speedferries in november 2008 ld lines in september 2010 the
     liquidation of seafrance in january 2012 and the end of the commercial operation of myferrylink in 2015 only two ferry
     companies operate on the short straits po ferries and dfds seaways the main competitors of eurotunnel groups shuttle
     services


     po
     po ferries po is a subsidiary of dp world a worldwide operator of port facilities

     po is the most important ferry operator on the short straits with six vessels and is in direct competition with eurotunnel group
     both in the freight market and in the passenger market

     po operates up to six vessels pride of kent pride of burgundy pride of canterbury spirit of britain spirit of france and
     european seaway two of which at 210 metres are the longest ships deployed on routes to and from dover


     dfds seaways
     dfds seaways is owned by the danish company dfds

     in 2015 dfds seaways operated three ships on the doverdunkirk link and two ships on the calaisdover link the contractual
     agreements on the operation of the ships the berlioz and the rodin are described in chapter 22 of this registration document


     myferrylink
     myferrylinks maritime service activity for the first half of 2015 is described in section 625 of this registration document the
     operational activity of myferrylink ceased at the end of june 2015


     ii shuttle services
     competitive advantages of the shuttle service
     the eurotunnel group considers that under normal operating conditions its shuttle service benefits from considerable
     competitive advantages over ferries even though certain market segments are inaccessible to it notably outofgauge vehicles
     and certain dangerous goods these competitive advantages are as follows
      speed the standard travel time between the french and british motorways is much shorter than via the ferries
      departure frequency the shuttle service runs more frequently than any of its competitors and it runs every day of the year
      convenience with the gsmp system shuttle services customers now have uninterrupted access to gsm and 4g services in
         the rail tunnel
      reliability the shuttle service unlike the ferries is unaffected by sailing conditions and is not dependent on the weather and
      environmentally friendly the electric power it uses for traction generates much lower greenhouse gas emissions than
         fossil fuels

     eurotunnels shuttle service also offers
      a freight service that is independent of the passenger service which has a peak tourist season
      more efficient management of loadingunloading and
      the direct management of its terminals in contrast to the ferries for which port operations are managed by third parties

under the terminal 2015 project described in section 521 of this registration document in 2015 the eurotunnel group enlarged
its freight terminals considerably in order to be able to cater to a larger number of vehicles


iii airlines
airlines and particularly lowcost airlines also have an indirect impact on the short straits market these companies serve many
destinations in continental europe and thus compete with operators in the short straits including the passenger shuttle service in
the shortstay leisure market many destinations in france are now served by lowcost airlines offering an alternative means of
transport between france and the united kingdom


iv eurostar
to a lesser extent eurostars highspeed passenger trains compete indirectly with the passenger shuttle service in the
leisure market


d geopolitical context in 2015
i  unprecedented migration crisis
the year 2015 in europe was marked by an unprecedented migration crisis from summer of 2015 the eurotunnel group noted a
sharp increase in the flow of refugees in the pasdecalais and had to cope with the substantial increase in intrusion attempts onto
the fixed link site

faced with these intrusion attempts and the risk of accidents on a railway site whose configuration and operation can be likened to
those of a major international airport the eurotunnel group launched a threepoint safety and security plan
 high security fencing 40 km of fencing including ground reinforcement for 10 km of existing fencing
 clearing following the request from the authorities clearance and thinning of hedges and bushes over 56 hectares around the
   concession site
 security staff staff numbers substantially increased

the governments of france and the united kingdom responded immediately with operational solutions to secure the fixed link
terminal in coquelles on 21 august 2015 the french minister for the interior bernard cazeneuve and his british counterpart
home secretary theresa may signed an agreement to handle the migratory pressure the joint contribution by the british and the
french governments financing of the reinforced security around the tunnel by the former and massive deployment of mobile
gendarme units around the clock by the latter helped improve the situation the mobile gendarme units virtually stopped
intrusions on the site using anticipatory manoeuvres in the areas leading up to the site where they intercepted migrants before
they could enter the concession area this provided the optimum security conditions to finalise the installation of the new high
security fencing

the fixed link now has a high level of protection following the major investment programme and the support of both france and
the united kingdom who are in charge of border controls in the long term it is intended to continue to reinforce the security
measures


ii terrorist attacks and threat in 2015
the year 2015 witnessed two major waves of fatal terrorist attacks in paris in january and november the terrorist threat in the
paris and brussels destinations is a determining factor when analysing the variance in passenger traffic for fixed link operations
in 2015

a state of emergency was declared in france in the night of 13 to 14 november 2015 following the paris attacks it was extended
until 26 february 2016 this change calls for the involvement of the entire border control staff and controls by the security
company have been reinforced


622 fixed link activities

the eurotunnel group operates and directly markets a shuttle service through the tunnel and also manages the safe and efficient
passage of highspeed passenger trains and of the train operators rail freight services on the railway network




                                                                        2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se              33

6    description of the eurotunnel groups activities

     a shuttle transport activities
     the eurotunnel groups sales marketing and operations strategy is focused on clearly differentiating its product from that of its
     competitors this strategy aims to ensure outstanding service quality and optimum security and involves the following
     key measures
      constant alignment of supply with demand to optimise revenue per shuttle
      commercial strategies providing a product offering even better suited to customers needs and
      cost control achieved through programmes to optimise maintenance and production management cycles and as well as the
        main subcontracting agreements the areas in which eurotunnel group uses subcontractors are described in section 1724
        of this registration document

     this business model focuses on operating margins and seeks to maximise profitability rather than to increase volume and
     market share


     i   truck shuttle service
     introduction
     the truck shuttle service carries trucks between france and the united kingdom on shuttle trains in each terminal drivers pass
     through dedicated checkin security and border control facilities other facilities for trucks are located close to the terminals
     drivers and their passengers do not remain in their vehicles during the crossing but travel in a separate carriage club car
     specially designed for this purpose these club cars were completely refurbished in 2014 cosy atmosphere more comfort and
     greater seating capacity

     the eurotunnel group has 15 truck shuttles six of which have capacity for 31 trucks and nine have capacity for 32 trucks thus
     enabling the group to operate up to six departures per hour in each direction

     on 15 january 2015 eurotunnel group announced the order of three new truck shuttles with a capacity of 32 trucks each the
     new shuttles benefit from the latest technical developments that not only enable energy savings but also make for greater
     sturdiness and reliability their delivery is scheduled for late 2016 to 2017 they will supplement the 15 existing shuttles this
     enhanced fleet will enable eurotunnel group to increase its capacity by 20 and move to a frequency at peak period of eight
     departures per hour compared to the current six


     strategy
     truck service marketing strategy
     the strategy is based on an optimisation of truck shuttle revenue and a pricing policy that reflects the value of the service provided
     by the eurotunnel group as well as its speed ease and reliability

     throughout the year the eurotunnel group gives priority to customers under contract only providing transport to occasional
     customers as available capacity allows as part of the project vision 2020 eurotunnel group is working on optimising the truck
     shuttle revenue with a project adjusting the pricing policy based on more flexible prices adjustable according to demand and
     available capacity in order to encourage an improved distribution of truck flows throughout the week and during the day so that
     capacity and occupancy rate can be optimised whilst maintaining service quality during peak days


     truck shuttle service market share
     the eurotunnel group estimates that its share of the truck shuttle service market on the short straits corridor has evolved
     as follows

                                                                            2015                                                   2014
                                                                                       market share
                                                                   vehicles              estimate                      vehicles            market share

          number of accompanied trucks transported by the truck shuttle service the market share percentages are derived by calculating the truck
           shuttle services accompanied truck traffic as a proportion of the total of such traffic on the short straits market as reported by irn services ltd


     ii passenger shuttle service le shuttle
     introduction
     the passenger shuttle service carries cars motor homes caravans coaches motorcycles and trailers between france and the
     united kingdom on shuttles tickets can be bought in advance at the website wwweurotunnelcom by telephone from the
     customer service centre from travel agents and on arrival at checkin customers remain in their vehicle throughout the crossing
     which normally lasts approximately 35 minutes from platform to platform each passenger shuttle has two sections a

doubledeck section mainly for cars and motorcycles and a singledeck section reserved for vehicles higher than 185 metres
mainly coaches minibuses and cars with roof boxes or towing caravans

the eurotunnel group has nine passenger shuttles able to carry up to 180 cars or 120 cars and 12 coaches the passenger shuttle
service can operate up to five departures per hour in each direction


strategy
the business model aims to optimise passenger shuttle revenue by increasing the average revenue per shuttle departure


pricing policy dynamic pricing
the groups pricing system calculates and adjusts ticket prices according to departure time and shuttle load factor this policy
optimises passenger revenue and the average ticket price for passenger vehicles cars motor homes caravans motorcycles
etc

currently le shuttle customer bookings made online represent more than 80 of bookings a new booking module for le shuttle
was deployed in november 2014 allowing for example smart phones applications and a new reservation module for tour and
coach operators that was deployed in the fourth quarter of 2015


adapting capacity to demand
the capacity of the passenger shuttle service is constantly adjusted to improve loading rates and reduce costs operational
changes that are made help to constantly improve this strategy such as better distribution of shuttle departures during the day
fewer passenger shuttles running at offpeak times and more during peak times and the optimisation of train crew management

over the medium term this policy has allowed the eurotunnel group to optimise the load factor which went from 45 in 2004 to
59 in 2015


customer experience
as a service business eurotunnel le shuttle puts the customer at the centre of its strategy and implements ways to enhance their
satisfaction and loyalty two main areas of progress are being developed
 realtime information for each customer at every stage of their experience with eurotunnel group and
 personalised service that is to say consideration of the specific needs of customer segments such as for example owners of
    electric vehicles and those travelling with their pets the eurotunnel group works constantly to improve the service launching a
    new online booking module for smartphones renovating the passengers building in the coquelles terminal world duty free
    lounge customer information centre etc enhancing realtime communication with customers through iboarding and
    installing tesla universal chargers and charging slots for customers

as part of the vision 2020 project described in section 624 of this registration document one of the themes is customer
information in realtime this is made up of three goals to provide any relevant information to each customer to refine knowledge
of customer expectations and to accurately measure the satisfaction of each customer the current geopolitical context puts this
project to the forefront


passenger shuttle service market share
the eurotunnel group estimates that its share of the car and coach passenger markets on the short straits were as follows

                                                                    2015                                                2014

     number of vehicles transported by the passenger shuttle service the market share percentages are calculated by converting the number of
      vehicles transported into car equivalent units ceu and determining the passenger shuttle services share of total ceu transported on the
      short straits as reported by irn services ltd
    number of vehicles transported by the passenger shuttle service the market share percentages are calculated by determining the passenger
      shuttle services share of the total number of coaches transported on the short straits as reported by irn services ltd


the car traffic segment for the eurotunnel group passenger shuttle service outperformed in the specific context of 2015 with the
number of vehicles transported remaining virtually stable down 06 in a market that declined 27 compared to 2014 due to
the difficulties arising from intrusion attempts by migrants and the paris attacks at the end of the year the market share for the car

     segment of the passenger shuttle service stood at 526 over the financial year showing a onepoint increase compared to 2014
     and a record for the fixed link since its opening


     b railway network
     in 2015 eurotunnel group earned 26 of its revenue 35 of fixed link revenue from the use of the railway network by
     highspeed passenger trains and train operators rail freight services the eurotunnel group does not operate these trains but
     manages their safe and efficient passage through the tunnel infrastructure

     the use of the tunnel by the railway companies is governed by the railway usage contract with the national railways which is in
     force until 2052 under this charging framework the railways are obliged to pay to the eurotunnel group fixed annual charges and
     variable charges according to the number of passengers on highspeed passenger trains the variable charges are determined
     according to a toll formula that applies throughout the life of the railway usage contract and which takes into account the effects
     of inflation to a certain extent in addition the railways are required to contribute to the operating costs of the system as well as to
     investment costs relating to the modernisation of equipment

     a simplified pricing mechanism for freight trains was put in place with charging per freight train instead of charging per tonne of
     freight this scale is published annually by the eurotunnel group in its network statement which sets out access conditions to its
     railway network implementing the charging framework of the railway usage contract for all railway companies for the operation
     of highspeed passenger trains and freight trains

     the eurotunnel groups revenue for its railway network depends solely on receiving variable charges payable according to the
     number of passengers transported by the eurostar highspeed passenger trains and the number of freight trains as well as the
     annual fixed charges as well as the contribution made by the railways to operating costs

     in 2015 the eurotunnel group generated e319 million of revenue from the use of its railway network


     i  highspeed passenger trains eurostar and new market entrants
     market developments
     the market for highspeed passenger train services eurostar and future new market entrants comprises business and leisure
     passengers travelling between the united kingdom and continental europe the market is geographically diverse and includes
     passengers travelling between london and paris or london and brussels as well as passengers travelling between other points in
     the united kingdom and france belgium the netherlands and germany eurostars highspeed passenger trains connect
     london with the centre of paris and brussels and compete directly with airlines on travel time frequency comfort and price for
     shortstay leisure travel eurostar also competes with lowcost airlines in terms of price capacity and choice of destinations
     eurostar operates a direct service to disneyland paris and to lyon avignon and marseille since may 2015 and a winter service to
     bourg saint maurice

     eurostars markets were marked in 2015 by the terrorist attacks and threats that led to a fall in demand in the middle of november
     followed by a gradual recovery in december rail traffic was also affected through summer to the beginning of autumn by the
     disruption caused by intrusions by migrants on the sncf tracks at frethun as mentioned in section 621di above this situation
     was brought under control as of 22 october 2015

    market share percentages are derived by calculating the volume of rail passengers as a proportion of the total volume of air and rail passenger
      traffic between paris and london and between brussels and london as provided by the caa brb and sncf

the share held by eurostar highspeed passenger trains in the passenger market for the parislondon route has reduced slightly
to 771 on average for 2015 compared to 784 for 2014 over the same period their market share over the same period on the
londonbrussels route fell slightly from 818 to 809


the competitive environment of highspeed passenger trains eurostar
in the business travel market eurostars highspeed passenger trains compete with the traditional and lowcost airlines that offer
regular flights between paris and london and between brussels and london in the leisure travel market eurostars main
competitors are the lowcost airlines not only on the routes served by eurostar but also to other destinations eurostar has taken
several successful initiatives in terms of marketing and special offers over the internet targeting the leisure travel segment the
subsidiary of sncf continued the schedule for the opening of new destinations in 2015 marseille and 2017 amsterdam

in the context of the liberalisation of the international rail passenger transport market on 1 january 2010 the eurotunnel group
responded by publishing in its network statement its efficient and nondiscriminatory conditions for access and offers new
entrants the option to operate crosschannel highspeed passenger train services in competition with eurostar and the airline
sector to existing or new destinations


highspeed passenger trains eurostar
eurostars highspeed passenger train services are jointly operated by eurostar international limited now 55owned by sncf
5owned by sncb and 40owned by a consortium of cdpq the caisse de dep               ˆ et placement du quebec
                                                                                        ot                      and hermes
infrastructure to which the british government sold its interest in eurostar in 2015

since 2007 when high speed 1 and the london terminal at st pancras international opened the eurostar highspeed passenger
train service has used a highspeed line between london and the eurotunnel groups uk terminal this line improves service
reliability and reduces the transit time between paris and london or brussels and london by around 20 minutes in addition
st pancras international station improves rail links with northern england due to the proximity of rail services from st pancras
kings cross and euston stations ebbsfleet international station located near the m25 london orbital motorway also allows
eurostar to expand its catchment area

in 2015 eurostar ran 14 to 18 departures in each direction between paris and london and seven to ten trains in each direction
between london and brussels on business days with adjustments depending on the day the season and the destination some
trains make intermediate stops at ebbsfleet or ashford international in the united kingdom and at calaisfrethun or lilleeurope in
france in may 2015 eurostar inaugurated a new direct service from london to lyon avignon and marseille operated all year long
with one to five roundtrips per week depending on the season however on the return trip passengers are required to disembark
at the lille station for border checks eurostar also runs a service to disneyland paris five days a week and a seasonal direct service
from london and ashford to bourg saintmaurice from december to april

in 2015 the number of eurostar passengers going through the tunnel increased slightly to 104 million source eurostar despite
the adverse market condition marked by the events of the year in particular the paris attacks calculated in accordance with the
railway usage contracts inflation linked pricing formula the toll per passenger paid by eurostar fell by 06 in 2015

     and in 2014 an additional seven more convenient with onboard wifi and individual sockets and faster than the present trains
     peak speed of 320 kmh they can accommodate 900 passengers 20 more than the initial fleet and are equipped with
     interoperable systems that are compatible with development of services to other destinations these trains will gradually phase
     out the existing trains after the test periods needed to eliminate any residual defects eurostar international limited has announced
     its plan to run a new direct service between london rotterdam and amsterdam from 2017

     additional opportunities exist for services to germany southern france andor switzerland

     deutsche bahn also stated in 2010 that it intended to launch ice passenger train services from london to cologne and frankfurt
     the schedule is yet to be confirmed given the announced delay in wagon manufacturing by siemens its operational outline for
     these services received approval from the igc in june 2013


     ii train operators rail freight services
     market developments
     train operators rail freight services compete with most modes of sea and road freight transport between continental europe and
     the united kingdom

     in 2015 this traffic was particularly impacted by the intrusion by migrants on the sncf tracks in frethun that caused major service
     disruptions and damage to goods from midjuly to the time when the authorities restored law and order on 22 october

     the freight volume transported by the train operators rail freight services is summarised below

     competitive environment of train operators rail freight services
     rail freight through the tunnel originally developed by staterun railways initially had a series of disappointing results and
     organisational difficulties which resulted in a drop in traffic from 3 million tonnes to 1 million tonnes between 1998 and 2007
     international rail freight is also held back by inadequate national infrastructure train gauge and length quality and availability of
     paths distortions that favour sea or road transport and excessive constraints whether regulatory social or technical

     in order to retain and relaunch train operators rail freight services since 2007 the eurotunnel group has pursued a
     comprehensive competitive strategy aimed at addressing the specific challenges in the crosschannel freight market through the
     implementation of certain measures in respect of openaccess rail development border restrictions and competitive pricing
     policies for rail freight services between 2007 and 2010 despite the revival of intermodal and conventional trains the demise of
     conventional single wagonload services in france and in greatbritain has resulted in the loss of more than a third of cross
     channel rail freight traffic marking a low of 2097 trains and 113 million of tonnes transported in 2010

     in may 2013 with the aim of promoting the development of the freight train traffic of railway companies in the tunnel eurotunnel
     group launched a program to help start new services etica extended in june 2014 following its positive results between 2010
     and 2014 the establishment of etica contributed to the growth in traffic of around 40 38 in number of trains and 46 in
     tonnage transported compared to 2010 pursued in the first half of the year 2015

     this growth dynamic was halted abruptly in the summer of 2015 by the intrusion of migrants on the sncf tracks in frethun leading
     to a protracted period of severe disruption of freight train services of rail companies until the situation was remedied by the end of
     october 2015 this resulted in the loss of half of the crosschannel rail freight services shifted either to unaccompanied services
     or to container transport via the north sea or more generally to transportation by road eurotunnel group is working with the
     british government to find ways and means of restoring the traffic

     train operators rail freight services
     the train operators rail freight services between continental europe and the united kingdom are run by railway companies
     including db schenker on behalf of brb sncf and its captrain subsidiaries europorte and gb railfreight and potentially any
     freight train operator in open access three different types of freight trains use the railway network
      intermodal trains composed of platform wagons transporting containers or swap bodies
      conventional trains carrying goods on pallets in enclosed wagons or bulk loads in adapted wagons such as tankers hoppers
         platforms etc making up a full train
      trains with specialised wagons for transporting new cars



38   2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se

                                     description of the eurotunnel groups activities                                                        6

rail freight trains are in competition with most modes of freight transport in operation between continental europe and the
united kingdom

in order to revive crosschannel rail freight the eurotunnel group has adopted a strategy that is based on three policies
i development of open access for all operators of rail freight trains ii dealing effectively with border restrictions and iii a
simplified and competitive pricing policy
 an average toll charge of 3000 e4500 per train in 2007 values for a train travelling at 120 kmh during an average
     busy period
 a simplified pricing structure one toll charge per train taking account of speed and peak and offpeak transit allowing
     operators to optimise their trainloads
 real and effective open access and the capping at e600 in 2007 values of essential crosschannel service costs dealing with
     border restrictions and specialised class 92 locomotives and
 competitive total costs compared with the road transport sector in order to encourage rail freight development

after 2010 with its repeated disruptions to rail freight and the end of single wagonload services the development of new services
between 2010 and 2014 resulted in an increase in traffic of 38 in terms of the number of trains and 46 in tonnage transported
compared with 2010 including the creation of new intermodal services and an increase in the transportation of steel aluminium
and vehicle parts

originally set up in may 2013 the success of the etica growth plan led in june 2014 to the intensification of initiatives to promote
rail freight with the expansion of the program for assistance to etica startups both over time opening extended until 2018 and
by expansion of eligible categories along with a 25 reduction of access charges during offpeak night periods for rail freight
services so that these growth efforts can produce their full effect eurotunnel group has also drawn the attention of authorities to
the need to address the barriers to development size length capacity etc on existing national networks which considerably
weaken the competitiveness and development of crosschannel rail freight

in 2015 these growth efforts suffered a major setback with the loss of half of the crosschannel rail freight services resulting from
major disturbances owing to intrusion by migrants on the tracks in frethun despite the 4 growth in the first halfyear traffic
declined sharply by 17 over the year 2015 eurotunnel group has already informed the european commission that the common
objectives of growth of the rail freight may not be met


c other income
the fixed link generated e16 million in other revenues in 2015 representing 1 of the eurotunnel groups total revenue 2 of
fixed link revenue these other revenues consist mainly of i revenue from thirdparty retail businesses in the terminals on both
sides of the tunnel ii revenue paid for telecommunication lines in the tunnel iii revenue related to the property business iv the
sale of travel insurance products in the united kingdom and v revenue related to ciffco training


i  revenue from thirdparty retail businesses
the eurotunnel group has built facilities for its customers on its two terminals in france and the united kingdom including shops
and other retail outlets

access to the shops bars and restaurants is available only to customers travelling on the shuttle services they are located inside
the terminals after checkin these facilities are operated by third parties under three to tenyear concession agreements on the
french side and under leases on the british side

the eurotunnel groups strategy is to offer travellers who choose to stop before making the crossing a choice and level of service
consistent with the overall quality and value of service offered by the eurotunnel group in 2013 the victor hugo passenger
terminal building in folkestone and the charles dickens building in coquelles were refurbished to the highest international airport
standards in order to welcome customers in a pleasant environment

in 1994 a contract was signed for 30 years for the operation of three petrol stations located at the entrance and exit of the
two terminals

the eurotunnel group also earns modest revenue from renting advertising boards on both terminals and around the terminal
exit routes


ii property business
the eurotunnel group owns and manages plots of land near its french and british terminals




                                                                           2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se                 39

6    description of the eurotunnel groups activities

     as an extension of its mission to design build and operate the fixed link the eurotunnel group was also given responsibility for
     local land development the fixed link is not just a transport infrastructure it was also designed as a platform for the future
     economic development of the kent and calais regions the eurotunnel group in the interests of sustainable development has
     restored the site of the former factory where the tunnel lining segments were made which was later used as a shelter for illegal
     immigrants red cross centre this restoration work has paved the way for a major commercial and tourism development
     project to stand alongside the cite de leurope shopping centre in coquelles

     eurotunnel group signed an agreement with the conseil gen        
                                                                    eral of the pasdecalais on 6 january 2009 covering measures to
     support this ambitious tourism development project

     as part of the responsibility for local land development given to it by the french authorities at the beginning of the fixed link
     project and in order to further boost the appeal of the pasdecalais region as a tourist destination euroimmo get a eurotunnel
     group subsidiary submitted a successful bid for the land development concession for the integrated seaside ecovillage and golf
     course project at the porte des deuxcaps the concession agreement was signed on 18 february 2013

     in general terms the development of the area entrusted to euroimmo get the project supervisor encompasses all the work
     relating to roads networks open spaces and various facilities designed to meet the needs of the future occupiers owners
     inhabitants and users of the new buildings the concessionaire will manage the assets acquired until they are transferred to the
     builders the concession will last for 10 years


     iii training activity ciffco the opal coast international railway training centre
     ciffco is a subsidiary 100 owned by eurotunnel group expert in railway operations ciffco is a training centre that is open to
     all rail operators infrastructure managers or industrial concerns for their staff training

     ciffco provides
      an experienced french and british team of specialists in railwaysrelated training
      a building entirely devoted to training located near the french eurotunnel terminal in coquelles
      powerful and modern driving simulators essential for learning to drive trains
      a distance learning platform and modern computer technology allow new teaching tools to be built developed and
        make available
      accreditations required to run its railway training centre activity ciffco has been approved for over 10 years by the french
        public rail safety authority epsf for training in rail security functions in the french railways ciffco is also approved as a body
        responsible for examinations of general professional knowledge related to train driving

     in 2014 the train driver training conducted by ciffco was officially registered in the french national directory of professional
                                
     certifications rncp repertoire       national des certifications professionnelles francais this will therefore allow it to issue a
     recognised professional qualification ciffco is now the first and only private training organisation with the capacity to deliver
     this qualification alongside the french public operator

     moreover since 20 november 2015 ciffco is the sole continued education provider in the railways sector whose train driver
     training has been recognised for its quality and its results in terms of employability through the label certification from itrans one
     of the leading worldwide competitiveness clusters in france and which has become a reference cluster for the railways at the
     national level


     623 fixed link capacities

     a the system
     i   the tunnel
     the number of trains or shuttles that can pass through the tunnel every hour is limited the tunnel capacity is expressed in terms
     of the number of standard paths per hour in each direction a standard path is defined as the time it takes a shuttle train operating
     at 140 kmh to cover that part of the system which under normal operating conditions is used by all other trains travelling through
     the tunnel

     one of the key factors determining the tunnels capacity is the signalling system at the date of this registration document the
     system permits 20 standard paths per hour in each direction under the railway usage contract trains belonging to the railways
     have the right to use up to 50 of the hourly capacity in each direction highspeed passenger trains and train operators rail
     freight services because of their faster or slower speeds relative to the eurotunnel groups truck and passenger shuttle services



40   2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se

                                     description of the eurotunnel groups activities                                                         6

use more than one standard path to travel through the tunnel at peak times speeds can be adjusted to maximise the number of
trains and shuttles travelling through the tunnel in 2015 the maximum number of standard paths used by passenger and truck
shuttle services was ten per hour in each direction

at the date of this registration document the tunnels capacity under normal operating conditions does not constitute a
significant constraint limiting growth in the different types of traffic

as part of its five year strategic thinking for the fixed link project vision 2020 and as indicated in section 624 of this registration
document the group is working on optimising tunnel availability itself notably by spending no more than one night per week
instead of the two at present on the maintenance of the two rail tunnels thanks to predictive maintenance tools a dedicated
tunnel measurement train will circulate each week to deliver a very accurate assessment of the condition of the track catenary and
other equipment eliminating long onfoot visual inspections

in the medium or long term the eurotunnel group believes that it will be possible to increase the tunnels capacity by the following
means
 setting uniform operating speeds for all trains which would allow more trains to run on the same number of standard paths at
    the date of this registration document goods trains travel in the tunnel at a speed of 100 or 120 kmh while highspeed
    passenger trains can reach a speed of 160 kmh in the tunnel these speed differentials use a large part of the system
    capacity because they require the eurotunnel group to leave greater intervals between trains than would be necessary if they
    all travelled at the same speed use of the systems capacity could therefore be improved by shifting slow or infrequent freight
    trains to offpeak times and by scheduling trains that travel at speeds higher 160 kmh or lower 120 kmh than the standard
    path 140 kmh so that they run in flights during peak hours
 increasing the power of the locomotives pulling the shuttles to allow the use of longer trains or reduce transit times
 the strengthening of the electrical power supply by replacing the boost converter
 reducing the headway between trains using the tunnel to 2 minutes 30 seconds instead of 3 minutes currently so as to raise
    system capacity to 24 standard paths per hour in both directions although this would mean improving the fixed
    equipment and
 improving the signalling system notably with ertms this initial phase creates no additional capacity

some of these measures require approval by the igc which has supervisory authority over tunnel operation

a dedicated optical relay system using 2g 3g and 4g telephone and gsmp mobile internet networks enables passengers on
shuttle services and highspeed passenger trains to use their mobile phones to make calls and access the internet this was put
in place in the north tunnel in 2013 and in the south tunnel in 2014


ii terminals
currently ten boarding platforms are in service at the french terminal and ten at the british terminal

both terminals were designed so that the number of boarding platforms could be increased to 16 in order to maintain traffic fluidity
and to increase the number of hourly truck shuttle departures capacity at the terminals will be expanded as stated in
section 624 of this registration document the terminal 2015 project notably enabled the development of a secure parking area
for approximately 370 trucks in coquelles and an increase in the number of toll booths and in the number of access lanes to the
checkin barriers

the terminals have self checkin lanes for all customers along with an automatic number plate recognition system these systems
improve traffic flow and reduce operating costs in a constant drive to improve the quality of service the coquelles and folkestone
terminal buildings have been refurbished in august 2015 the eurotunnel group opened a new building dedicated to welcoming
pets in coquelles bigger more friendly and safe a play area with a variety of play equipment and a digital display screen was
created in the charles dickens building in coquelles meanwhile the victor hugo building in folkestone was given awardwinning
sanitary facilities a prayer room and special facilities for severely disabled people


b rolling stock
plans to develop the shuttle fleet are described in section 624 of this registration document


c railway services passenger and rail freight
under the railway usage contract trains using the railway network are entitled to use up to 50 of the total capacity of the
tunnel that is allowed by the signalling system this currently amounts to ten standard paths per hour in each direction for
highspeed passenger trains eurostar and new entrants and train operators rail freight services goods trains currently
transport an average load of about 500 to 600 tonnes each although some of them can transport more than 1000 tonnes of



                                                                           2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se                  41

6    description of the eurotunnel groups activities

     freight and travel at speeds varying between 100 and 120 kmh an increase in the average load or the travel speed of goods trains
     would allow the railway companies to increase freight train traffic without additional use of the tunnels capacity similarly
     increasing unit capacity and occupancy on highspeed passenger trains those of eurostar and new market entrants and
     synchronising them so that they run in flights would enable more passengers to be transported without using additional tunnel
     capacity for both types of traffic the increased unit occupancy rate of the trains enables rail companies to increase the
     economic efficiency of their services thus creating a natural incentive to make optimum use of the tunnel capacity in this context
     the new e320 trains put into service by eurostar since november 2015 have a 20 increase in unit capacity compared to the initial
     fleet leading to a proportional increase in the tunnel capacity in terms of the number of passengers

     under the terms of the railway usage contract the eurotunnel group may use any surplus capacity not used by the railway
     companies if they have not confirmed their capacity requirement by the previous day use of this surplus capacity provides the
     eurotunnel group with additional flexibility in optimising the flow of traffic and scheduling passenger and freight trains and shuttle
     service departures


     624 fixed link system reliability

     a tunnel availability and maintenance
     scheduled weekly maintenance of the tunnel is planned and structured so as to promote efficient use of the tunnel and cause
     minimal disruption to commercial operations

     the eurotunnel group has set itself an objective of limiting service disruptions due to fixed equipment failure to less than 075
     despite continual traffic growth in 2015 tunnel availability was 9974 compared with 9977 in 2014

     the operational plan aiming to restrict fire risk salamander plan and the creation of firefighting stations safe contribute
     towards protecting the infrastructure in case of fire on board a truck shuttle this plan proved effective on 17 january 2015 when
     the teams had to deal with a small fire on a truck and a section of catenary that had fallen the implementation of the salamander
     plan enabled the fire to be rapidly contained and damage to be limited


     b rail replacement
     rails on the terminals are replaced as part of the routine maintenance programme without major disruption to commercial
     services the strategy implemented has reduced costs without harming the quality of the track this strategy aims to avoid
     systematically replacing both lines of rails but only those rails that are worn or that present defects

     the third in tunnel rail replacement campaign began in 2014 and will be completed early 2016 the first 73 kilometres were laid in
     2014 and 2015 and the laying of the remaining 27 additional kilometres will take place in 2016 this work is taken advantage of to
     inspect the sleeper blocks concrete parts on which the rail rests thirtythree kilometres of track will be replaced each year on
     friday saturday and sunday nights over 11 weekends at the start of each year


     c maintenance and availability of rolling stock
     the eurotunnel group has also set itself the objective of achieving better utilisation of its transport capacity by improving load
     factors on its rolling stock this is in addition to improving the availability of the rolling stock by modifying maintenance procedures
     in order to optimise periods of operation

     the repair and maintenance programmes implemented by the eurotunnel group have helped to improve the reliability of the
     electric locomotives and truck and passenger shuttles in planning its maintenance programmes the eurotunnel groups
     objectives are the following
      ensure that safety requirements are met
      avoid rolling stock being out of service for prolonged periods and
      maximise the number of shuttles available at peak hours

     the locomotives truck shuttles and passenger shuttles every 600 to 1200 days depending on the vehicle and the number of
     kilometres it has covered each component is taken out of service for one to six weeks to undergo an extensive preventive
     maintenance programme

     the departure cancellation rate for passenger shuttle services due to faults in rolling stock was 114 in 2015 compared to 14

eurotunnel group is implementing simplification and renovation programmes aimed at further reducing future maintenance
requirements and improving reliability

the goal of the lsm large scale maintenance programme is to
 meet safety requirements bogie brake coupling batteries etc
 restore and improve the reliability of systems that have reached about a third or half of their overall potential canopy sdl
   hydraulic etc
 extend the life of wagons breda floors arbel floors etc and
 ensure customer comfort air conditioning toilets interiors etc

in 2015 eurotunnel group also undertook works for reinforcing the catenary that provides the required traction for the shuttles and
the trains circulating in the rail tunnels


d maintenance strategy
the time tunnel infrastructure maintenance excellence programme has led to a reduction in overnight maintenance from three to
two nights per weekend since september 2012 as a result of reduced subcontracting costs optimisation of maintenance times
and efficient working methods this optimisation is ongoing and since early 2013 maintenance work on the terminals on friday
and saturday nights has been limited and is now transparent for commercial operation and all of the tunnels capacity is fully
available for customers

the process of optimising the rolling stock maintenance strategy has continued its aims are
 to improve the availability performance and quality of the shuttles
 to increase processing capacity and so minimise the total cost of maintenance and
 to rationalise technical choices and industrial resources

this process is based on several lines of work
 the extension of the light and indepth preventive maintenance cycles both for truck shuttles and for passenger shuttles
   which has a significant impact on the availability of shuttles and processing capacity
 the technical redesign of maintenance on systems with a high impact on performance and quality focusing on the relevance of
   maintenance instructions and the implementation of appropriate lsm programmes and
 the optimisation of key processes such as corrective maintenance reprofiling and axle replacement with improvement in the
   efficiency of human industrial and it resources


e projects
the eurotunnel group completed the terminal 2015 project for which works had begun in the summer of 2014 on both terminals

concerning the terminal on the french side the work first focussed on the creation before check in of a buffer storage area
equipped with five lanes from the entrance onto the site up to the tolls where the number of lanes was increased from four to six
the second major investment in the french terminal is the construction of a secure parking for 370 trucks

concerning the terminal on the british side the infrastructure developments separate the flow of trucks from that of the cars that
will run on the ten existing lanes the trucks have five new lanes before checkin

the eurotunnel group carried out an ambitious security plan in parallel at the coquelles site from summer 2015 to prevent
intrusion by clandestine migrants into the united kingdom under this plan notably security fencing and infrared cameras
were installed

various other initiatives should increase the reliability and efficiency of the system including notably the three third generation
truck shuttles ordered in early 2015 which will benefit from the latest techniques

more broadly as part of a collaborative dynamic the eurotunnel group decided to define and orientate the fixed link strategy for
the next five years identifying issues and challenges and deciding on goals to be achieved by 2020 project vision 2020

as part of this improved performance over the long term several working groups have been set up to bring together broad
transverse and collaborative themes including
 fluidity of the terminals the project aims to reduce transit times between the arrival of a customer on the site and their boarding
    a passenger or truck shuttle
 improving the availability of rolling stock the loss of capacity due to the departure on midlife maintenance of a passenger
    shuttle in 2017 will be offset by developments on the other eight passenger shuttles

a uk rail freight market
the uk rail freight market is valued at about 900 million with gb railfreight having a current market share of approximately 17
in the following sectors
 bulk coal construction petrochemicals steel and waste
 intermodal international and domestic
 automotive
 infrastructure network raillondon undergroundrail services

in the united kingdom the latest figures published in april 2015 for the year show railway freight traffic to be 2221 billion tonne
kilometres net the second highest in the last twelve years the year 20132014 has recorded the highest growth at 2271 billion
tonnekilometres net traffic increased by 30 since 20062007 and by 5 in the 20142015 period with new traffic types which
according to forecasts are expected to increase fourfold before 2034 these new markets are essential for railways freight to
replace the diminishing coal and steel traffic aggregates transport is yet another area of considerable growth up 17 in
20132014 and 10 in 201420154

in the united kingdom the sensitivity and behaviour of customers in response to environmental issues is already influencing
purchasing criteria and has led companies to pursue or prove their commitment in this field thus for example two large british
supermarket chains tesco and sainsburys are making increasing use of rail freight in their supply chains to reduce their carbon
footprint

the environmental advantages of rail freight are clear 26 of the uks co2 emissions come from transport 90 of this being road
transport while rail freight produces three to four times less co2 per tonne transported than road transport and up to ten times
fewer polluting emissions5

the uks main political parties are in favour of freight distribution by rail recognising its role as a green alternative to road transport
this support is obvious when we consider the following points
 promotion of the growth of rail freight  2007 white paper on rail transport6 which included the launch of the strategic rail
   freight network and supported a doubling in rail freight volumes
 promotion of the efficiency and capacity of the railway network as specified in the publication from the department for
   transport in september 2009 entitled strategic freight network the longerterm vision7 and
 the strategic funding of the freight programme through the transport initiatives fund the department for transport has
   contributed funding to network rail specifically for investments focused on rail freight


b french rail freight market
in the first three quarters of 2015 french rail freight volumes reached 2562 billion tonnekilometres up 57 compared to the
same period in 2014 2424 billion tonnekilometres europorte in france transported 12 billion tonnekilometres up 258

cover all rail freight service segments both short and long haul intermodal combined transport bulk traffic including coal
infrastructure equipment rail industry services construction materials petrochemicals and metals and general commodities

as a result of the business relationship established with energy suppliers drax power and more recently with eon energy gbrf is
the first company to transport biomass as an alternative to coal in the united kingdom it has also been a major supplier to the
crossrail project the suburban rail network of more than 100 km which will serve london and its environs from 2018

the company has longterm contracts in place for the majority of its customers during 2015 the company renewed several of its
existing contracts including drax power siniat and fcc waste services the company has also secured a major new contract
with tarmac for the transport of aggregates

scotland for the franchise operator serco the company also started the testing and delivery of the trains for the intercity express
programme iep for hitachi rail europe

the main sectors of gbrfs activity are summarised as follows
 bulk transport these services represented 45 of gbrfs revenue in 2015 the transport of coal between ports and power
   stations represents half of this activity and is complemented by the haulage of biomass aggregates and other hook and
   haul services
 intermodal transport the transport of containers is the second largest sector of activity for gbrf 21 of revenue after bulk
   transport and infrastructure this sector is largely concentrated on services out of the port of felixstowe the uks major
   container port and is particularly susceptible to the economic environment since it is linked to the level of imports and exports
   to and from the united kingdom the recent infrastructure investment at the port of felixstowe represents an opportunity to
   develop gbrfs container services

     641 euro carex

     the eurotunnel group is involved in the euro carex project via its subsidiary london carex limited paris charles de gaulle
     amsterdam schiphol lyon saint exupery       and liege    airports linked up with logistics companies including fedex tnt and la
     poste to try to encourage a transfer of air freight onto the european highspeed railway network london carex is part of this
     umbrella organisation the euro carex association tasked with developing the british end of the network the carex concept is
     similar to a cargo aircraft running on rail highspeed trains that have been modified to carry air freight containers a fullscale trial
     was carried out in march 2012 with a carex tgv carrying parcels from lyon saintexupery to london st pancras with a stop at
     roissycharles de gaulle the trial proved the concept to the satisfaction of all carex partners in 2013 london carex continued
     its studies into setting up a branched terminal on hs1 and under the aegis of euro carex coordinated the drafting of
     specifications notably examining the conversion of highspeed passenger wagons that have reached the end of their commercial
     life into freight wagons as is the case in the aviation industry in 2014 euro carex liege carried out a detailed survey financed by
     the european commission relating to terminal settings including air security euro carex lyon also published the results of a
     survey concerning handling on the terminal in 2015 the association entrusted a business plan validation task with customers to
     the vicepresident cargo of the schiphol airport in parallel the association appointed a former member of the european

     642 eleclink

     via its subsidiary get elec limited the eurotunnel group joined forces with european venture capital company star capital
     partners in 2011 to create eleclink limited a joint venture 49 owned by get se and 51 by star capital the eleclink project
     aims to lay a new electricity interconnector between the french and british grids by running two direct current cables through the
     tunnel the project fits in with the european policy to develop infrastructure between member states and will provide a completely
     secure way to optimise electricity transmission

     after having signed in 2013 the connection offers with the two electricity transmission public network the national grid in the
     united kingdom and the reseau        de transport delectricite in france the company obtained in 2014 from the regulatory
     authorities in both countries and from the european commission the regulatory exemption allowing it to trade for 25 years and
     offer longterm contracts of a 20year maximum duration eleclink therefore launched in november 2014 a phase of expression
     of interest during which almost 40 market players expressed interest in being awarded longterm interconnection capacity these
     long contracts represent up to 80 800 mw of the interconnection the remaining 20 will be marketed in the form of short
     term contracts to electricity transmission networks trading or investment companies the preferred supplier status was granted to
     qualified companies in the third quarter of 2015 the works are scheduled to begin in 2016 and operations are scheduled to begin

    rail freight services by train operators db schenker on behalf of brb the sncf and its subsidiaries and europorte using the tunnel


the eurotunnel group earned revenues of e319 million in 2015 from the use of its railway network by eurostars highspeed
passenger trains and by the train operators rail freight services

the number of eurostar passengers using the tunnel remained stable in 2015 compared to 2014 traffic at the beginning of the
year had been affected by the terrorist attacks in paris in january but then went on to benefit both from growth in demand and the
launch of a direct service from london to lyon and marseille in the third quarter of 2015 traffic was impacted firstly by the migrant
crisis and then more significantly from midnovember by the attacks in paris and the states of emergency in paris and brussels

the number of rail freight trains increased by 4 in the first half of 2015 mainly due to an increase in intermodal transport and to
the favourable impact of etica eurotunnel incentive for capacity additions the financial assistance scheme to start up new
services however the many incidents related to intrusions by migrants at the sncf site at calais frethun from june badly
affected the rail freight activity and forced railway operators to periodically suspend nighttime rail freight traffic as a result the
number of rail freight trains was sharply down by 17 for the year as a whole


b fixed link concession operating costs
the fixed link segments operating costs amounted to e392 million in 2015 an increase of 7 compared to 2014 this e26 million
increase was due mainly to

 a net increase of e32 million for the fixed link activity
 stable operating cash flows for the europorte activity and
 a net improvement of e18 million in operating cash flows from the myferrylink segments activity which reflects the termination
   of the activity at the end of june and includes the recovery of receivables in the second half of the year


1022 cash flow from investing activities

net cash flow from investing activities increased from e78 million in 2014 restated at the 2015 exchange rate to e106 million in
2015 in 2015 this included
 net payments of e74 million relating to the fixed link 2014 e40 million of which e19 million was spent on the terminal 2015
   project e15 million on rolling stock e8 million net of reimbursements received on the security reinforcements e7 million on
   replacing rails in the tunnel and e7 million on the gsmr project
 net payments of e59 million for europorte mainly as part of the acquisition of new locomotives in the uk and france to develop
   the activity expenditure of e26 million was subsequently refinanced by sale and lease back transactions and
 net receipts of e2 million including the reimbursement of a guarantee deposit relating to eleclink limiteds activity

     the financing structure of the eurotunnel group is set out in section 224 of this registration document




     104 restrictions on the use of capital resources

     the restrictions resulting from the financial covenants provided in the term loan are described in section 224 of this registration
     document




     105 sources of funds for future investments

     the main future investments for the fixed link are expected to be selffunded in 2015 the group used e135 million from the
     capex reserve account which is intended to finance longterm investment projects the balance of this account e35 million at
     the exchange rate at 31 december 2015 will serve to finance major investment programmes such as the purchase of the three new
     truck shuttles and the other projects described in chapter 5 of this registration document

     acquisitions of rolling stock for europorte may be funded by external loans or sale and leaseback transactions investments in
     respect of the eleclink project are described in paragraph 52 of this registration document




     106 debt service cover ratios

     pursuant to the terms of the term loan the eurotunnel group is required to meet the following financial covenants
      at each halfyear closure the debt service cover ratio must not be less than 110 for the purposes of this test the ratio is
        calculated on a rolling 12 month period on a consolidated basis taking into account i as regards the calculation of available
        cash flow for the servicing of debt the borrowers and guarantors in connection with the senior facilities and ii as regards the
        calculation of debt servicing the eurotunnel group failure to meet this financial covenant amounts to one of the events of
        default and accelerated payment as described in note v of the consolidated financial statements contained in paragraph 2031
        of this registration document

     at each sixmonthly test date after 31 december 2007 the ratio of operating cash flow to the total synthetic debt service on the
      term loan must not be less than 125 for the purposes of this test the ratio is calculated taking into account the hypothetical
      amortisation on the term loan and on the basis of a rolling 12 month period prior to the date of the test failure to meet this ratio
      on a sixmonthly testing date would lead to restrictions on the use of the groups excess available cash flow on the date of the
      next interest payment on the term loan until such time as the test is met once again these restrictions include in particular
      the ability of the eurotunnel group to pay dividends and to finance new activities failure to meet this test on three consecutive
      six monthly testing dates would trigger a prepayment event under which the groups excess available cash flow would have to
      be used towards prepayment of the term loan until the testing date on which the ratio is met once again

the debt service cover ratio and the synthetic service cover ratio for groupe eurotunnel se at 31 december 2015 were 183 and
164 respectively and thus the financial covenants for the period were respected

     111 research and development

     the high traffic volumes in the system have led the eurotunnel group to focus its research and development strategy on improving
     the performance of its rolling stock and the reliability of its infrastructure as well as the reinforcement of the safety of its customers

     the eurotunnel group has launched a programme of study for the design of a new generation of truck shuttles and for the
     redefinition of the passenger shuttles this comprehensive research programme builds on innovative projects such as the design
     of new superstructures on its truck shuttles wind deflectors combining the functions of the protection provided by the pagodas
     with energy savings by improving aerodynamics the design of new floors for the truck shuttles and of new fire doors in the
     passenger shuttles the purpose of this programme is to significantly increase the level of performance and reliability of the
     rolling stock

     moreover in order to deal with ever more intense operational issues specific to it the eurotunnel group has initiated a research
     programme in order to develop a new sleeper block a piece of concrete on which the rail is laid which is stronger in order to meet
     the demands of usage constraints and increased traffic this project uses internal resources and those of external partners whose
     railway and materials expertise provides a better understanding of the phenomena and the development of innovative solutions to
     overcome identified technical issues

     the teaching and research professorship for railway transport sciences set up by the eurotunnel group with the ecole nationale
     des ponts et chaussees whose purpose is to carry out research on evolutions in technical infrastructure analysis of its life cycle
     the design of intelligent rail systems and the understanding of the phenomena of density has been particularly occupied by
     this project

     the group has reinforced its fire prevention policy by developing a new solution for detecting and extinguishing a fire onboard its
     locomotives this project carried out with various experts in firefighting resulted in the completion of tests in the laboratory and
     on site in order to validate system performance

     the group is also a founding member of the railenium scientific cooperation foundations board of directors railenium is an
     institute for technological research in the rail industry selected within the framework of frances economic stimulus plan le grand
     emprunt it is composed of a foundation for scientific cooperation and a test centre raileniums mission is to provide a platform
     for rail infrastructure research and development testing engineering and training the foundation pools the work of research
     bodies and companies to develop research and development programmes in the field of rail infrastructure and systems which may
     go as far as industrial prototyping the foundations partners include seven research and training organisations 15 industrial
     companies involved in construction services and engineering and three infrastructure operators sncf reseau sncf and the
     eurotunnel group an agreement was signed between eurotunnel and railenium on 11 march 2015 which allows members of
     railenium to carry out stress testing of materials to characterise the mechanical demands on infrastructure and to validate new
     digital path models of the track on the eurotunnel network in order to carry out innovative projects

     the main trends relating to or affecting the eurotunnel groups operations are described in chapters 6 and 9 of this registration
     document

     the eurotunnel group has been pursuing a development strategy based on longterm value creation for several years now this
     strategy built into various competitiveness improvement plans is based on the major strengths of the group
      a unique expertise as concessionaire of the fixed link a factor that offers great credibility in front of partners
      a continuously improving service offer and
      an economic model based on solid foundations

     these major strengths are deployed in the context of a migratory crisis of an unprecedented scale in europe and the persistent
     terrorist threat in this new environment the eurotunnel groups strategy combines performance and quality of service and to that
     end the group has placed human capital at the heart of this strategy at the service of its customers

     according to the terms of the concession agreement it is the concessionaires task to operate the fixed link and the states task
     to implement the means required to ensure a continuous and smooth flow of traffic since 1994 this fast ecofriendly land link has
     become a vital link between the united kingdom and the continent to preserve the smooth flow of exchanges with the
     united kingdom that was upset in the autumn of 2015 by the impacts of the migration crisis the two states in their sovereign
     capacity contributed to putting into place a highlevel of protection for the fixed link which has ensured for several months now
     the sealing of the borders over the long term it is planned to continue to reinforce the security of the site

     the short straits truck market continued to grow in 2015 despite the disruptions in the geopolitical situation the eurotunnel group
     has set itself the goal to consolidate and in certain segments strengthen its position in this expanding market through investments
     intended to increase the number of truck shuttles and the availability of rolling stock and to improve traffic flows notably through
     the terminal 2015 project expansion works on the coquelles and folkestone terminals and the three new truck shuttles it has
     ordered have been carried out in order to be able by 2020 to cater for
      2 million trucks
      3 million cars and
      135 million highspeed train passengers

     the eurotunnel group shall focus on the groupwide strengthening of its growth drivers in 2016 such as the europorte segment
     that offers a vast range of integrated rail freight services across europe while at the same time reaffirming the priorities of safety
     and service quality and pursuing the projects to develop the tunnel infrastructure in promising markets such as eleclink a major
     project for laying an electrical interconnector between france and great britain

     the eurotunnel group will continue to prepare for the future by working on the second phase of its debt refinancing project
     particularly the floatingrate portions to minimise in the long term all things being equal the groups debt service cost

     the group has set itself the financial objective of e560 million in ebitda in 2016 which includes the potential consequences of
     further episodes of the migration crisis or terrorist acts and on the same assumptions e605 million in 2017 based on an exchange
     rate of 1e1375

     this objective is based on data assumptions and estimations deemed reasonable in particular they take account of the
     consequences of the geopolitical context and may change or be modified owing to uncertainties particularly in the economic
     financial competitive and regulatory environments in addition the occurrence of certain risks described in chapter 4 risk
     factors of this registration document would have an impact on the groups activities and its ability to achieve its objectives
     furthermore achieving the objectives implies the successful implementation of the strategy presented in chapter 6 description
     of the eurotunnel groups activities of this registration document the eurotunnel group does not therefore make any
     commitments nor does it give any guarantee that the objectives will be met and the forwardlooking information contained in this
     chapter cannot be used to make profit forecasts

151 remuneration policy for executive officers

the remuneration policy for the chairman and chief executive officer is decided by the board of directors based on the work and
recommendations of the nomination and remuneration committee

following the recommendation of the nomination and remuneration committee the board of directors wanted the remuneration
policy for the chairman and chief executive officer as well as as the case may be the other executive officers to be simple to
offer continuity over time and to be consistent with the groups remuneration policy including for the management the
remuneration for executive officers is linked to mid and long term growth to the intrinsic value of the company and to the share
performance it is set in line with the average remuneration per employee the dividend and the results

the board of directors decided that the remuneration policy should encourage longterm performance in all key areas of the
business whether they be strategic workforcerelated social or environmental and not only financial issues in line with the
european recommendation of 30 april 2009 the performance criteria for the executive officers variable remuneration have been
designed to encourage longterm performance

following a proposal of the nomination and remuneration committee the board of directors ensures that the remuneration of the
executive officers is consistent with the longterm interests of the company and its shareholders and that the different
components of the remuneration of the executive officers fixed and variable remuneration possible granting of additional
retirement benefits and share options or preference shares are commensurate and compliant with the principles set out in the
afepmedef code the board of directors wishes that the criteria do not create a risk to incentivise executive officers to favour
shortterm goals that could influence their variable remuneration and may have a negative influence on the company in a medium
and long term

in particular the board of directors strives to adhere to the following guidelines
 completeness all the elements that make up the remuneration of executive officers are reviewed each year the fixed and
    variable elements and share options or preference shares benefits in kind attendance fees and retirement conditions
 intelligibility of the rules and balance the rules are simple stable transparent and where possible enduring each element of
    the remuneration is clearly substantiated and is in keeping with the general interest of the business the variable part intended
    to reflect the actual contribution of the executive officers to the success of the group changes according to criteria representing
    the results of the group as well as the operational targets set for the year
    at the start of each financial year the board of directors on the recommendation of the nomination and remuneration
    committee defines each of the targets set for the executive officers for the year in question and determines what proportion of
    the overall variable part each of them may obtain after the close of the financial year the nomination and remuneration
    committee evaluates the achievement of the targets and based on that assessment the board of directors decides the
    variable part to be awarded to each executive officer the variable remuneration awarded for a given financial year is therefore
    paid in the following year
     the part based on the achievement of targets linked to the groups intrinsic annual performance is based on financial
        indicators determined according to group objectives
     the part based on the achievement of operational targets is based on criteria set taking into account the capacity to achieve
        certain strategic objectives
     the share options and preference shares include internal performance criteria ebitda target and payment of dividends
        andor as the case might be external performance criteria to ensure their financial alignment with the longterm interests of
        the shareholders
 measurement remuneration is determined taking into account the general interests of the business market practices and the
    performance of the executive officers in line with the groups remuneration policy the fixed part of the chairman and chief
    executive officers remuneration was not revised in 2015 in addition given that the overall performance of the business
    depends on good management of relations with all the stakeholders the csr performance criterion included in the calculation
    of the chairman and chief executive officers remuneration is calculated through the groups composite csr index
 internal and external consistency in its recommendations to the board of directors the nomination and remuneration
    committee ensures that the remuneration policy proposed is
     adapted to each individuals responsibilities
     consistent with the remuneration policy for the employees of the group
     in line with comparable groups and
     linked to the performance of the shares of get se in order to optimise the performance of committed capital and alignment
        of incentives between executive directors and shareholders

15 remuneration and benefits

        in order to consider the consistency of the remuneration of the chairman and chief executive officer with market practice the
        committee carried out its own analyses and to appraise the results also commissioned a specialised consultancy mercer to
        undertake a study of the positioning of the chairman and chief executive officers remuneration in relation to remuneration
        paid by other similar groups of companies

     the remuneration sums shown in this chapter 15 cover all remuneration due or allocated to the executive officers for all of their

  qualitative survey with both its internal and external stakeholders this approach identified four themes that are directly related
  to the groups activities healthsafety social climate greenhouse gas emissions and customer satisfaction indicators and
  targets have been determined for each of these items so as to calculate the level of achievement of the composite index in

 90 of the maximum if 95 of the target is achieved
 100 of the maximum if 100 of the target is attained
 110 of the maximum exceptional bonus if 110 of the target is achieved
 120 of the maximum exceptional bonus if 120 of the target is achieved

this scale enables the overperformance of some criteria to be taken into account without however the total amount exceeding
the maximum set by the board of directors for the variable part of the remuneration 120 the modulation scale for the

the 25 the committee also noted the full achievement of the objective relating to key strategic investments and of the
objective relating to the groups longterm growth prospects the committee also considered the figures of the composite
csr index the committee noted on the basis of the figures for 2015 as compared to the reference values that the objectives

155 alignment assessment of compensation against
performance

in order to assess the remuneration of the chairman and chief executive officer in line with the total return for shareholders the
nomination and remuneration committee referred to two comparative analyses prepared by an independent firm specialising in
executive compensation studies mercer

the first study was designed to measure the relative remuneration of the chairman and chief executive officer compared to
peers this study focused on the remuneration of chairmen and chief executive officers of an intersectoral panel of 23 french
companies in the sbf 120 with common characteristics to the group in terms of number of employees and revenue the
comparison of the remuneration of the chairman and chief executive officer with the practice of these companies showed that
 the annual base salary of jacques gounon e500000 is below the first quartile e625000
 the annual variable remuneration in 2014 for jacques gounon e500000 is between the first quartile and median market
 longterm sharebased incentives granted in 2014 to jacques gounon recalculated taking as a basis the valuation at the date
   of vesting market price less the exercise price is below the first quartile
 total annual compensation in 2014 for jacques gounon is less than the average of the panel and
 the structure of the remuneration of jacques gounon is in line with that of the panel 13 base salary 13 short term incentive and
   13 longterm sharebased incentive




                                                                         2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se               95

15 remuneration and benefits

     the second study was designed to assess changes in the remuneration of the chairman and chief executive officer in relation to
     that of the relative performance of the company compared to a historical panel of its peers consisting of twelve companies
     comparable in terms of nature of business

     the performance of these companies has been measured using three performance indicators revenue the total return on equity
     total shareholder return and net result the results of these three indicators were compared with changes in the remuneration of
     the chairman and chief executive officer of the eurotunnel group as presented in this chapter 15 given however that for this
     second study to take the method used by some analysts the instruments granted in the longterm compensation are not taken
     into account at the time they are vested that is to say when all the performance conditions related to the instruments have been
     met thus for option plans the value of options granted to executive officers was assessed when they may be exercised to the
     extent that the performance conditions have been met

     this analysis showed an absolute alignment of the total compensation of jacques gounon for the eurotunnel group with a
     correlation coefficient of 099 compared to an optimal alignment measurement of one

     the committee also considered the absolute measure of performance comparing the evolution of the remuneration of the
     chairman and chief executive officer of groupe eurotunnel se compared to the performance of an investment in get se shares
     over the last five years this showed that the evolution of pay is correlated with financial performance




     156 other remuneration policy considerations

     remuneration of the members of the executive committee
     as stated in chapter 17 of this registration document the eurotunnel groups remuneration policy is based on fair and transparent
     remuneration to ensure complete consistency between individual goals and business objectives the groups strategy is also to
     share its success with its employees in order to involve them in the groups growth the groups remuneration policy aims to
     promote the achievement of economic social and market performance enhance the growth of skills meet and outperform
     objectives and increase the commitment of employees and officers in the long term while strengthening employee ownership

     the members of the nomination and remuneration committee ensure consistency between the policy applied to executive
     officers and the policy applied to the senior managers of the group the members of the nomination and remuneration
     committee also examine the alignment of the managers remuneration principles

     the remuneration of the chief operating officers which is decided by the general management is made up of fixed annual
     remuneration supplemented by an incentivising variable part the criteria for which are largely based on the groups economic
     performance as is the case with the variable remuneration of the chief executive officer and deputy chief executive officer the
     variable financial part is accompanied by qualitative criteria to assess individual performance

     the members of the executive committee also receive remuneration made up of a fixed part the amount of which is proportional
     to each ones responsibilities supplemented by a variable part whose quantitative criteria depend on the groups results in order to
     improve the sense of solidarity

     the eurotunnel group adapts its corporate governance to the specific needs of the business in a bid to ensure continual progress
     in its governance structure get se has adopted the combined system which consists of the appointment of one person to serve
     as both chairman and chief executive officer the rationale behind the continued combination of the roles of chairman and of chief
     executive officer is justified to ensure a more efficient and reactive management linked to the specific history of the business and
     in difficult regulatory competitive and market environments this organisation promotes an active dialogue between the
     management and the board of directors

     this method of governance safeguards the prerogatives of the various corporate bodies and complies with the good governance
     rules to which get se has always adhered indeed the binational nature of the business was reflected early on by the
     implementation of exacting governance standards within the group which enable the preservation of the interests of all
     shareholders as well as a balance of power within the governance structures
      the size of the board of directors 11 members allows for real debate to take place and for clear and rapid decisionmaking
         particularly as board members are committed to their role are independently minded and bring to the business a wide range of
         skills in the 2015 selfevaluation of the board the directors confirmed their satisfaction as to quality of the discussions
         conduct of business by the chairman freedom of expression and time reserved for discussion
      the board of directors is very active 13 meetings in 2015
      the majority of board members are independent 82
      five board committees have been set up and each is very active in 2015 more than 22 committee meetings took place making
         a total of 35 meetings including full board meetings
      some of the committees including the audit committee and the nomination and remuneration committee are exclusively
         composed of independent board members
      so as to promote best ethical and governance practices within the group the board of directors set up an ethics and
         governance committee in 2013 the terms of reference for which can be found at paragraph 1623 of this registration
         document
      since 2014 colette neuville in her capacity as senior independent director is responsible for monitoring and managing any
         potential conflict of interest situations that may arise for the executive management and other board members for suggesting
         to the chairman of the board additional agenda items for meetings of the board of directors as required for ensuring that good
         governance takes place within the board of directors and committees and for managing each year the evaluation of the board
         of directors on the basis of an anonymous detailed questionnaire on the roles and competence of the board its functioning as a
         whole and the areas dealt with by the board and its committees

     board members and the executive management have built a strong tradition of transparency and dialogue the governance
     structure and the matter of the dissociation of roles are the subject of a specific item in the board selfassessment questionnaire
     for 2015 the current combined role chairman and chief executive officer in one person was also strongly supported

described in section 1623 of this registration document


independent board members
at least half of the board members must be independent within the scope of and in accordance with the criteria of the
recommendation 9 of the afepmedef code

the criteria for board members to be reviewed as independent are the following
 not to be an employee or executive director of get se or an employee or director of its parent or a company that the latter
   consolidates and not having been in such a position for the previous five years
 not to be an executive director of a company in which get se holds either directly or indirectly a directorship or in which an
   employee appointed as such or an executive director of get se currently in office or having held such office for less than five
   years is a director
 not to be a customer supplier investment banker or commercial banker
    that is material to get se or the group
    or for whom get se or the group represent a significant part of their business
   the evaluation of how significant the relationship is with get se or the group must be debated by the board of directors the
   significance or not of a business relationship is not only considered in terms of quantitative criteria the board of directors also
   considered other parameters for considering that such a relationship is not material and free of major conflict
 not to be related by close family ties to an executive director
 not to have been an auditor of the corporation within the previous five years
 not to have been a director of the corporation for more than twelve years

board members representing substantial shareholders of the company may be considered independent so long as such
shareholders do not participate in the control of the company however where the interest of the shareholder in question exceeds
10 of the share capital or voting rights the board of directors must consider the matter of the board members independence on
the basis of a report from the nomination committee taking into account the structure of the capital of the company and the
existence of potential conflicts of interest


board members who satisfy the independence criteria
the board of directors is required to verify at least once a year that board members satisfy the independence criteria set out above

after consideration of their individual position by the nomination committee the board of directors resolved on 17 february 2016
that the following board members met the independence criteria set out in the afepmedef code colette neuville patricia hewitt
perrette rey peter levene colette lewiner robert rochefort philippe vasseur tim yeo and since 31 may 2014 jeanpierre
trotignon whose term of office as deputy chief executive officer of eurotunnel group has ended for over more than five years on
31 may 2009

philippe camu a representative of gs global infrastructure partners the companys main shareholder and jacques gounon
chairman and chief executive officer are not considered to be independent board members

the board of directors on the recommendation of the appointments and remuneration committee has ensured that there are no
significant business relationships between group companies and other companies outside the group in which independent board
members of groupe eurotunnel se are also appointed as a director

the board considered a multicriteria analysis of the appointments and remuneration committee the board of directors referred to
a table summarising fund flows purchases and sales occurring during the financial year elapsed between
 group companies on one hand and
 group companies of which independent board members of the company are also a board member

these flows are considered in relation to the total weight of purchases and sales for each group to measure their significance for
2015 this table shows that the sum of sales of the companys group to any one of the groups concerned or of its purchases from
any one of those groups does not exceed 02 of the total sales or purchases of the companys group or of any one of the groups
concerned with the exception of two suppliers edf and colas a board member of which colette lewiner is also a member of the
board of groupe eurotunnel se




                                                                         2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se                105

16 board and management practices

      firstly the board of directors noted and confirmed the practice of initiating calls for tender the board of directors carried out a
      qualitative analysis of the parameters used to determine whether or not such a relationship is material and if it is exempt from
      conflicts of interest including but not limited to
       the period and continuity precedence history renewals
       the importance or the intensity of the relationship possible economic dependency exclusive relations or predominance in
          the sector in which the business relationship is established distribution of bargaining power etc
       the organisation of the relationship colette lewiner is not a member of the board of directors of the contracting companies
          france manche sa and the channel tunnel group ltd europorte and holds no direct deciding power over the contracts and
          agreements constituting the business relationship colette lewiner has received no compensation associated with the
          contract link or business relationship that may exist with edf and colas

      thus the board of directors on the recommendation of the appointment and remuneration committee confirmed the absence of
      any significant business relationship in 2015

      therefore as at 17 february 2016 there are nine independent board members out of a total of eleven representing 82 of the
      board members in office more than half of the board members are independent in accordance with the recommendations of the
      afepmedef code

      the table set out below indicates the situation of each board member in relation to the independence criteria referred to in the
      afepmedef corporate governance code

the high participation rate of board members throughout the year should be noted particularly in the context of the european
migration crisis of 2015 during which the board of directors led by a strong affectio societatis and with remarkable mobilisation
and strong cohesion faced with the chief executive officer this unprecedented situation this frequency and rate of participation

b definition objectives and scope of internal control and risk management
internal control is a system comprising a combination of means modes of conduct procedures and actions adapted to the
specific features of each company it contributes to the effective management of the companys business the efficiency of its
operations and the efficient use of its resources and should enable it to appropriately factor in all significant risks be they
operational financial or compliancerelated

specifically the system seeks to ensure
 compliance with the laws and regulations in force
 the implementation of instructions decided by the general management
 the proper functioning of the companys internal processes particularly those related to safeguarding its tangible and
  intangible assets
 the reliability of financial information

internal control is not restricted to a set of procedures or mere accounting and financial processes and it does not encompass all
the initiatives undertaken by corporate or management bodies moreover it cannot provide an absolute guarantee that the
companys objectives will be achieved

the internal control and risk management system extends throughout the group and its consolidated french and british
subsidiaries

as part of its continuous improvement approach in 2015 the group implemented the following actions to reinforce the internal
control and risk management system
 the body of procedures was structured updated and enhanced for the group and the business units
 the register of group risks based on a reference framework common to all subsidiaries and the individual registers for each
   subsidiary set up in 2013 were updated at the 2015 annual review




                                                                       2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se             117

16 board and management practices

      1692 comprehensive risk management and internal control process

      a risk management procedures
      the objective of the groups risk management process is to enable general management and the board of directors to
       have a complete consistent and structured view of all types of major risks to which the company is exposed and of their
         evolution and
       appreciate the appropriateness of the mitigating measures implemented by those responsible for managing each of the risks in
         the light of their potential impact on the companys strategic objectives

      risk management contributes to creating and preserving the companys value assets and reputation it provides greater security
      in the companys decision making and in its processes which promotes the achievement of its objectives it fosters consistency
      between the companys actions and its values and seeks to mobilise the companys employees around a common vision of the
      main risks and promote awareness among them of the risks inherent to their work


      i   identification and analysis of risks
      this first stage allows the key risks threatening the achievement of the companys objectives to be identified and consolidated a
      risk can be either a threat or a missed opportunity it is characterised by an event which has one or more sources and one or more
      consequences this identification will be followed by an analysis which involves examining the potential consequences of the key
      risks consequences that may be financial human legal or related to reputation and estimating the likelihood that they may come
      to pass this dual approach is a continuous process


      ii risk management
      the risk management system is monitored and regularly reviewed with a view to its ongoing improvement the aim is to identify
      and assess key potential risks and draw lessons from incidents

      the process includes a formal annual review presented to the audit committee and subsequently to the board of directors of
      get se at the end of the financial year under consideration the risk reviews are based on the strategic plan applicable at the date
      of the relevant review

      risk reviews are coordinated by the companys corporate risk manager these reviews seek to identify and quantify the risks
      facing the company and to identify and assess the mitigating measures put in place to manage them they make it possible to
      implement a risk map

      the process which consists primarily of formal interviews with directors and senior management across the company comprises
      two parallel approaches
       a topdown approach consisting of the identification of the risks linked to strategic initiatives both from the point of view of
         their direct effect on the companys business and the knockon effect that they may generate on preexisting risks and
         changes in the companys economic environment and
       the traditional bottomup approach which seeks to identify risks in each of the main business areas commercial
         technicaloperational financial staff safety and security environment and corporate governance

      the identification of new risks is based on the systematic review of external sources of information global conditions
      benchmarking trade bodies etc and internal information developments within the company interviews and lobbying of the
      management team

      the risk register contains the following information
       description of the risk
       residual risk assessment following consideration of mitigation measures based on criteria of probability of occurrence
         and impact
       identification of the risk manager and the degree to which that manager considers the risk is managed as at the date of the
         review with a view to improving this

      the risks are classified in order according to the degree to which they are critical all the eurotunnel group risks are grouped in
      categories and subcategories which are common to all subsidiaries to enable an appropriate and homogeneous point of
      comparison between them in addition a group register has been compiled to enable monitoring at a more global level

      thus the risks of each group subsidiary and the risks monitored at a corporate level are mapped in this manner this approach
      initiated in 2013 was completed and enhanced with the 2015 annual review



118   2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se

                                                                   board and management practices                                         16

this approach of identifying and analysing significant risks and processes strengthens the groups knowledge of risk by
formalising and consolidating work already done in this area as part of the exercise of the 2015 annual risk review the head of the
group financial control with the main business units and senior management have established a definition of the risk appetite
approved by the board of directors as the level of risk that the group is willing to take in a given area in order to achieve its
objectives risk appetite can also be expressed through quantitative and qualitative criteria the groups appetite for risk is
implemented by the executive officers and applied by the management of the various entities and functional departments
through
 governance bodies and decision mechanisms supervision and monitoring
 structure identifying key risks to watch risk management policies through limits and
 monitoring budget monitoring reporting


iii treatment and monitoring of risks
each risk has a level of control that corresponds to the systems of selection and implementation of the measures aimed at altering
it the company may envisage a number of measures reduction transfer deletion or acceptance of a risk the choice of how to
manage a risk will involve in particular weighing opportunities against the costs of risk management measures while also taking
account of their possible effects on the likelihood andor consequences of the risk occurring the controls to be put in place fall
under the scope of the internal control system in this way the internal control system contributes to the management of risks
incurred in the companys activities

the corporate risk manager and internal audit monitor major risks and new or emerging risks on an ongoing basis and any
significant changes are reported to the executive committee and to the audit committee


b components of internal control
internal control comprises of five closely related components as follows
 control environment
 risk assessment
 control activities
 information and communication
 monitoring

they are implemented by the group as follows


i  control environment
the control environment which is key to the internal control system and essential for good risk management and procedural
application is based on human behaviour and is the foundation for other internal control elements

the control environment of the eurotunnel group is based on the following elements
 a general human resources policy which sets out the groups values and operating principles as well as the key measures in
   place in relation to working conditions and practices staff training and development and standards of conduct for the group
   ethics and integrity are the surest guarantee of sustainable and responsible growth to that end the general policy is set forth in
   the charter of ethics and behaviour which was approved by the board of directors on 28 january 2013 and distributed to all
   employees with the coming into force of the bribery act in the united kingdom the group has reviewed its anticorruption
   policy and put in place various appropriate measures notably to remind employees and partners of the importance of this
   issue in this context the ethics compliance steering committee was specifically set up in 2015 to ensure the implementation
   of adequate procedures training and communication
 the board of directors keen interest in internal control and general managements express desire for continuous improvement
   of operational processes
 definition of responsibilities by means of a corporate organisation chart distributed via the intranet and job descriptions with
   responsibilities in addition to the implementation of delegation of authority and approval limits in key areas and formal

17 corporate social responsibility

      171 overview of eurotunnel groups csr procedure

      1711 origin of the csr procedure and eurotunnels commitments

      groups history and commitments
      from the very beginning as an innovative rail company and responsible infrastructure manager eurotunnel group has adopted a
      social responsibility policy which seeks to reconcile financial performance social equity and environmental protection within a
      framework of continuous improvement

      eurotunnel group has placed social responsibility at the heart of its business activities and in its interactions with the various
      internal and external stakeholders clearly demonstrating its commitments to its partners such as employees customers
      suppliers shareholders investors regional government bodies local authorities associations and communities


      overview of the csr policy
      eurotunnel group has set up a formal csr policy supported and sustained at the highest level of the organisation by the chairman
      and chief executive officer and the board of directors in particular this policy which entered into force in 2015 dictates the
      groups principles challenges and commitments the csr objectives are defined each year and are included in the objectives
      assigned to the directors and the heads of the various entities of the group

      true to its principles the group has implemented for over twenty years now a policy that is both demanding and concrete to
      promote corporate social responsibility mainly in three main areas that represent the strategic priorities in its business
       people ie each of the 3992 men and women employed by eurotunnel group
       region ie all communities the group is connected to everywhere in france in the uk and in europe
       nature ie the environment and ecosystems with which its growing operations interact

      eurotunnel groups csr policy is in line with the observance of fundamental rights as defined in the major international principles 
      the 1948 universal declaration of human rights the ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work oecd
      guidelines for multinational companies and the principles of the united nations global compact eurotunnel group supports
      adheres to and actively participates in the world forum for a responsible economy and the values it promotes


      1712 materiality and dialogue with stakeholders

      group teams in each of their respective areas are listening to their stakeholders and primarily to their clients in order to ensure a
      correlation between their expectations and the groups longterm goals constructive dialogue based on trust is clearly
      established with the various stakeholders to go even further the group aims to formalise the results of the dialogue at different
      levels of its organisation

      in 2015 eurotunnel group conducted a materiality analysis to determine its most significant ethical social or environmental
      challenges both internal and external to the company in light of the potentially major impact on its stakeholders its environment
      or its economic performance this analysis was conducted in a context that was not yet affected by the migration crisis and its
      impacts in terms of security brand image and customer service the procedure included consulting with the main stakeholders
      within and outside the group to identify and establish the hierarchical order of the groups primary csr challenges both internal
      and external it also allowed the group to identify present and future opportunities and risks that could have a significant impact on
      its stakeholders its environment or its economic performance


      methodology
      materiality analysis consists in identifying the main csr challenges for the group and establishing their hierarchical order based
      on its operations and its stakeholders expectations this analysis was conducted by kpmg in three main steps

      step 1  identification 57 challenges were identified through internal and external documentary review of eurotunnel group
      groups publications and publications by companies in the same sector analysis of media coverage and repositories
      specifications

      step 2  assessment by the stakeholders 25 internal and external stakeholders were polled by an independent third party based
      on a questionnaire the top 25 csr challenges were identified

step 3  prioritising of challenges this is represented as a materiality matrix that reflects the importance given by the respondent
stakeholders and the impact that each challenge has on the groups business


results
by establishing this hierarchical order it identified a list of challenges arranged in their order of priority top priority very important

                    5    environmental performance                          general policy governing environmental management


eurotunnel group assessed all the policies procedures and means adopted for each of the challenges in order to determine the
actions to be conducted to consolidate or step up its performance as part of a continuous improvement process

with this procedure the primary values of the group were singled out according to its stakeholders safety and security service
employees environment innovation

most of these priority challenges were deemed by the stakeholders to be adequately addressed by the group safety of
employees travellers and goods general policy governing environmental management safety in particular comes across as both
a priority challenge and a core value for the group the stakeholders also emphasised the importance of the groups role as a
promoter of rail freight with low environmental impact compared to transportation of goods by road eurotunnel groups actions
in the field of energy are foremost among those cited when discussing the groups csr procedure

       safety of employees travellers goods and sites as well as the efficiency and reliability of the equipment and infrastructures
       wellbeing at work and balance between private life and professional life
       implementation of efficient forms of dialogue with employees

      1721 health and safety

      groups challenges and policy
      site safety and security safety of employees travellers and goods as well as the efficiency and reliability of equipment and
      infrastructures were identified by eurotunnel group stakeholders during the materiality analysis as being the priority challenges for
      the group safety is also a part of the groups values and is considered by the stakeholders to be adequately addressed by the
      group several mechanisms and procedures which are reinforced on a regular basis are used within eurotunnel group and its
      entities to ensure and reinforce work safety and security

      additionally the group makes a distinction between two areas of its activity namely safety and security
       the group defines security as protection against external risks resulting more specifically from deliberate malicious acts
       safety involves the protection against risks arising from faults damages errors and hazards of a physical emotional or
        psychological nature etc

      employee health was also identified as a major issue for the group in the materiality analysis conducted in 2015 for the eurotunnel
      group health is a comprehensive state of physical mental and social wellbeing that is promoted in the company by monitoring
      employees being attentive to them and conducting preventive actions with the department of occupational health monitoring of
      aptitudes interviews with medical staff psychological help vaccination campaigns improvement of working conditions
      recognising hardship etc

      safety is an absolute priority for eurotunnel group within the board of directors the safety and security committee oversees the
      safety of customers employees subcontractors and all stakeholders performance in matters of safety is monitored regularly as
      part of the continuous improvement process with appropriate corrective actions taken as needed the group has adopted policies
      and procedures to ensure the health safety and wellbeing of its staff safd and oenv

      fundamental to the fixed link design safety has remained a core operating principle and a key challenge across the group the
      transportation system has reached a safety level that is recognised as good and supported by the feedback gathered right from
      the beginning of eurotunnels operation with the health and safety mechanisms set up by eurotunnel group employees are
      guaranteed working conditions in compliance with the governing laws in each location of the groups sites and the human
      resources policy of each subsidiary in order to test response plans for the emergency services and good coordination in the event
      of an accident in the tunnel eurotunnel and the authorities organise an annual major fullscale safety exercise the binat as in
      binational held in january 2016 the latest binat was the 25th since the construction of the tunnel and the 19th since the opening
      of services in 1994

      eurotunnel commends the enhancement of appropriate behaviours and has established a set of procedures to ensure that the
      infrastructure and equipment are used efficiently the control over all of these risk areas provides the foundation for overall safety
      performance

      like safety health has always been a major concern for the group its policy in this area is based on transparency discipline and
      discussion at all levels in the company it is sent to everyone and reviewed in light of the experience gained

      in france a charter on the handling of workrelated psychosocial risks has been in force since april 2009 for esgie employees
      this establishes the procedure adopted by the company to deal with cases of suffering at work in keeping with this charter a
      commission was set up to anticipate and address workrelated psychosocial risks and a psychological unit was created in
      july 2015 with the members of the committee on hygiene safety and working conditions chsct the commission whose

actions and means implemented
organisation
within the board of directors the safety and security committee ensures that the mechanisms and procedures designed to
ensure the safety of customers employees subcontractors and all stakeholders are implemented additionally each segment of
the group has its own safety and sustainable development department whose main task is to define the companys safety
objectives and to guarantee the implementation and application of all the safety rules it is also in charge of measuring
performance within the various departments with the objective of steadily establishing a safe and healthy work environment all
safety performance are regularly monitored by each of the entities as part of a programme for continuous improvement and any
corrective actions are taken as necessary

the main security expenditure to ensure system security in 2015 stood at a net amount of approximately e29 million e12 million
in 2014 and e113 million in 2013 for the fixed link


safety of facilities
the safety management system of europortes french and british entities licensed as rail companies is mandatory under the
legislation of the different countries in which they operate

the operating system for the shuttle was designed under the supervision of the intergovernmental commission igc and the
safety and security committee each phase of the initial design was examined by the igc and formally acknowledged by way of a
noobjection statement

igc and the safety and security committee were created under the treaty of canterbury and the concession agreement igc and
the safety and security committee are charged with supervising the construction and operation of the system on behalf of the
united kingdom and france in addition epsf the french rail safety authority carries out audits under a specific mandate from
the french delegation of the safety and security committee

safety features and procedures are updated regularly and are part of the safety management system which ensures the validity of
the operating certificate issued by igc in accordance with laws and regulations resulting from the transposition of the european
unions railway safety directive 200449ec of 29 april 2004

the system has detailed safety security and policing features meeting the requirements of the united kingdom and french
authorities the security measures that were taken for the protection of the system include access control to the perimeter of the
terminals and cctv monitoring

safety and security measures for highspeed passenger trains and for freight train operators have been developed by the
operators after discussion with and with the approval of the united kingdom and france the train operators work with
eurotunnel group as the infrastructure manager to implement and continuously improve these safety measures

in the course of the year 2016 icg is expected to transfer its economic regulation authority to two regulators in france and the
united kingdom arafer and orr from the time the transfer is made checks and terms of operation of the user rail companies
will be handled by arafer and orr


safety the utmost priority for the link
the channel tunnel has a team of 48 rescue mission specialists who patrol the service tunnel round the clock since 2011 four
safe stations are operational in the intervals in the centre of tunnel so that in the event of a fire on a truck shuttle the 800 metre
long train can rapidly reach one of these stations the channel tunnel is the only infrastructure of its type in the world equipped with
a system of this kind


site safety
intrusion attempts on the coquelles site in the nordpasdecalaispicardie region rose sharply in 2015 to remedy the situation
eurotunnel group set up a major investment programme with the support of the united kingdom and france who are in charge of
border controls this multiyear action plan notably includes the construction of 37 km of highsecurity fencing the threefold
increase in the number of guards the installation of scanners to detect intrusions and check points as well as the close

      coordination with sncf reseau     in charge of the calaisfrethun site safety and security these actions have helped to
      considerably reduce intrusion attempts and forestall disruption in operations


      health and safety in the workplace
      all safety events are recorded and analysed in order to issue recommendations and produce action plans additionally various
      safety indicators are monitored continuously and systematically notably by the safety and security committee with the board of
      directors in order to ensure improved overall performance this is particularly true of the indicators of the safety of employees and
      subcontractors and of the transportation system

      prominence is also given to feedback that is implemented routinely in the groups subsidiaries after a full year or following a
      significant event this feedback brings the lessons to be learned for the future and helps alter organisational methods effectively
      with a view to making them more efficient

      the group takes special care to ensure that its safety and security rules and procedures are enforced by its subcontractors that
      are required to sign a contractual agreement on compliance with labour laws and regulations

      each subsidiaries deploys procedures and action programmes to limit and prevent the major risks inherent to the activities of its
      employees and to improve their quality of life at the workplace


      a committee dedicated to the improvement of working conditions
      in france eurotunnel group has set up a committee on hygiene safety and working conditions chsct whose task is to ensure
      the protection of the health and safety of employees and the improvement in their working conditions this committee that is
      composed notably of staff representatives analyses occupational risk and ensures  through means including surveys and
      inspections  compliance with the regulations in place it is consulted prior to any major modification in working conditions

      in the united kingdom the occupational health service plays a key role in preventing occupational illnesses through the
      education and the promotion of health issues and through the suitable control measures that are set up to improve working
      conditions

      from a medical standpoint employees have regular medical checkups with the occupational healthcare professionals and can
      request a medical examination independently of these checkups for esgie in france and esl in the united kingdom the group
      has appointed an occupational healthcare professional and two nurses to monitor employees health

      particular care has been paid in the last few months to the concession staff who have had to cope with situations of suffering
      owing to the migration crisis and the numerous intrusion attempts in the site by migrants this difficult context largely explains the
      deterioration in certain safety indicators

      in 2015 eurotunnel group also continued its actions in favour of health and safety by conducting awarenessraising sessions and
      training for its employees
       170 managers and team leaders of fixed link attended the twoday safety excellence workshops that dealt with the values
          principles risk analyses and the impact of every persons behaviour on safety
       25 staff representatives managers and senior executives of eurotunnel participated in a day organised at the alstom transport
          premises in valenciennes where they discussed and shared their experience in matters of safety and continuous improvement
          of processes
       europorte organised the 4th edition of the safety week on healthy lifestyles and their repercussions on work which included
          68 site visits

17 corporate social responsibility

      group partnerships for the development of the railways
      eurotunnel group offers its expertise in managing transport infrastructures and rail activities to research to training and to different
      public bodies at the european national and regional levels

      in research and development eurotunnel group is a founding member of railenium the european institute for technological
      research in rail infrastructure located near valenciennes and chosen by the french state as an investment programme of the
      future since 2015 eurotunnel hosts railways tests in connection with railenium to accelerate the typeapproval of civil
      engineering structures the tests are intended to measure the durability of tracks and equipment and will enable preventive
      maintenance and possibly selfreparability the group is therefore actively participating in the design of a rail infrastructure which
      is more sustainable economical intelligent and safer

      the eurotunnel group also provides support for the works of the european committee for standardisation as part of the working
      group responsible for drafting a proposed standard for calculating the greenhouse gas emissions of transport services

      the eurotunnel group is a founding member of the fer de france association which was created in 2012 to bring together the
      leading players in the french railway industry the works presided over by the group led to proposals for the french state to
      recognise different professions in this developing sector

      the eurotunnel group is also an active member of itrans the global competitiveness cluster and the reference cluster for railways
      in france the groups human resources director participates as the controller in the capfor training project management and
      coordination circle operational group that aims to make existing training more consistent with the industrys expectations creating
      a pool of expertise in the region and developing highquality higher education with international influence


      1733 regional development

      groups challenges and policy
      the development of local employment and local economy are listed among as important challenges in the materiality analysis

      the eurotunnel group has carved a niche for itself in its environment and has shaped that environment in a positive manner as an
      employer it participates directly and actively in local economic development and pursues its mission as developer in consultation
      with stakeholders as a committed partner in its economic and social environment eurotunnel group has always been a leading
      economic player and local employer its mission is fully in line with the regional foothold approach iso 26000 defines as an
      organisations proactive outreach to the community aimed at preventing and solving problems fostering partnerships with local
      organisations and stakeholders and adopting civic behaviour towards that community

      the eurotunnel group considers its commitment to regional matters to be crucial especially as it contributes to improving the
      overall performance of the company internal climate and social cohesion and to enhancing employee loyalty

      to meet these challenges the eurotunnel group endeavours to establish links with all the local communities by providing active
      support to the associations schools universities and organisations with which it works closely on both sides of the fixed link
      this commitment notably relies on its dialogue with all its stakeholders


      actions and means implemented
      development of local employment
      for over 20 years now the tunnel is a vital link between great britain and continental europe since the tunnel came into
      operation it has created 8100 direct and indirect jobs in the kent and pasdecalais regions and led to the building of largescale
      associated infrastructure notably new motorways highspeed railway lines and international railway stations

      pursuant to the regeneration agreement signed in 2006 with the french state eurotunnel group continues to contribute financially
      and through its expertise to calais promotion the pasdecalais development agency this contribution is earmarked primarily for
      supporting job creation similarly the group provides financial support and actively participates in the crossborder job fairs a
      local initiative that facilitates the professional mobility of young people between france the united kingdom and belgium

      through its commitment to fondation agir contre lexclusion face which provides assistance to those most in need eurotunnel
      group encourages its employees to get involved in and initiate humanitarian and charity projects several parttime work contracts
      were signed as of 2013 between the subsidiary esgie and a person assisted by face calais a recent contract concerned an
      environmental protection assignment totalling 400 hours of work

other subcontracting and service partnerships were signed between esgie and local companies to develop employment and
guarantee the regional foothold for the groups activities these partnerships represented about 380 fte in 2015 for various works
and especially services provided


development of local economy
in connection with its role as a developer the eurotunnel group through its subsidiary euro immo get was chosen in
january 2013 by the municipality of sangattebleriotplage to develop the seaside ecovillage and golf resort at porte des
deuxcaps this project will involve building an internationalstandard golf course a luxury hotel and an ecofriendly residential
development of 500 housing units

the groups land banks at coquelles pasdecalais were gradually transformed into a 700hectare mixed development zone
zac that now includes a shopping centre drawing 6 million visitors per year on average

in france the europorte companies as a whole are developing their rail freight haulage activities which enable disused
marshalling yards and railway lines as well as lines with restricted traffic to continue operating or to be brought back into service
however without political will on the part of the actors responsible for developing transport infrastructure the progressive
deterioration or eventual disappearance of the feeder networks could have as described in chapter 4 of this registration
document a major impact on the income of epf which obtains a third of its business from the transportation of grain

under an agreement similar to a publicprivate partnership the eurotunnel group alongside the french state the
nordpasdecalaispicardie region the cci cote dopale and the urban community of dunkirk and sncf reseau is financing
feasibility studies on the modernisation of the frethuncalaisdunkirk railway line which would involve its electrification and an
increase in rail freight path availability


solidarity actions
a key player in the natural economic and human environment the eurotunnel group fulfils its social responsibility through
concrete commitments and solidarity actions for community support

this organisation aims to promote a responsible global economy by sharing the best business practices of responsible companies


1734 best business practices being fair and responsible

groups challenges and policy
the setting up of the code of ethics and the responsible purchasing policy were identified as an important challenge in the
materiality analysis the eurotunnel group is committed to building a climate of trust and fair relations with all of its stakeholders
within or outside the group as a signatory of the united nations global compact eurotunnel group endorses its fundamental

      principles including the tenth principle which states that businesses should work against corruption in all its forms including
      extortion and bribery


      actions and means implemented
      ethics
      in its charter of ethics and behaviour approved by the board of directors in 2013 eurotunnel group sets out the common rules
      regarding respect for people fair competition internal controls and environmental protection

      the group operates as a collection of entities in various sectors of activity and geographical areas these principles and guidelines
      for action apply to all the employees of the group and its subsidiaries as well as to their subcontractors and suppliers failure to
      abide by these ethical rules by employees of the group can lead to disciplinary action


      relations with suppliers
      the relations between eurotunnel group and its suppliers go beyond the mere purchasing of goods and services in compliance
      with the principles set down by the charter of ethics and behaviour the acha 0019 procedure professional ethics code set out
      the groups ethics standards these standards not only ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but beyond legal
      criteria they make for the building of a climate of trust in exchanges between group representatives and third parties each group
      buyer or other collaborator undertakes to abide by the professional ethics code and to seek suppliers who share these
      commitments the tender process is designed to guarantee the fair treatment of suppliers during consultations

      in representing the groups csr values and engagements the procurement divisions of the various entities have taken actions
      that beyond referring to the eurotunnel groups charter of ethics and behaviour in all new contracts require their suppliers to
      comply with its fundamental principles and to sign the compliance policy article 23 article 2321 requires that suppliers comply
      with the french regulations on corruption as well as uk corruption laws notably the bribery act 2010

      the sustainable development aspect is included by concessionaires as part of their tendering process for subcontracted work on
      their fixed link sites subcontractors are required to commit contractually to respecting labour laws and regulations as europorte
      operates mainly on its customers sites as regards the management of port infrastructure it integrates on the port authorities
      requirements into its own subcontracting contracts

      in january 2012 the eurotunnel group signed the charter for responsible supplier relations this charter includes ten
      commitments for responsible purchasing ensuring a genuine partnership between customers and their suppliers with due regard
      to their respective rights and obligations it is committed in particular to ensuring financial equity towards suppliers to respecting
      the principle of transparency to incorporating the environmental dimension or even to ensuring the territorial responsibility of its
      company it thereby represents a measure to prevent corruption

      the eurotunnel group is also a member of steering committees for the responsible supplier relations charter and certification
      and has clearly demonstrated its wish to be a part of this certification process as an extension of the implementation of the
      charters ten engagements




      174 nature

      overview of the groups policy
      in a world of limited natural resources to ensure their sustainability companies must make constant efforts to have full control over
      their energy consumption and reduce the impact of their operations on the environment for the eurotunnel group this is a
      obvious there can be no success in the long term without strict control over ones environmental impact


      the most material challenges
      the groups environmental commitment is focussed on the challenges that have been deemed the most material in the materiality
      analysis
       the general policy for environmental management and in particular training of employees in environmental issues
       the management of energy consumption and the increased use of renewable energies
       the circular economy policy and waste management

      the tunnel and its rail transport system provide certain intrinsic environmental advantages
       the tunnel runs entirely underground and does not interfere in any way with the marine environment and

   the use of electric power 90 of which is of nuclear or hydraulic origin for haulage produces minimal atmospheric pollution
    and much lower greenhouse gas emission levels than fossil fuels

spurred on by the group europorte has stepped up its environmental procedure alongside the implementation of the transparent
reporting on abstraction from and discharge into the environment an environmental impact assessment of the activities of
europortes french entities was completed in 2013 resulting in various measures being taken to mitigate this impact
 energy consumption optimised to reduce contributions to the greenhouse effect
 environmental criteria taken into account when planning maintenance programmes for its shunting engines oil leaks and
   particulate emissions at the end of 2015 17 of the socorail site is now equipped with newgeneration engines
 appropriate mechanisms set up for segregatingcollecting and treating the various types of waste produced
 environmentally friendly products chosen
 green areas created for the parking and maintenance of machines
 improved management of hazardous situations involving customers
 awarenessraising among staff about civic environmentalism practices

in 2014 europorte and its longstanding customer malteurop frall set up a reflection cell to deal with csr best practices the
objectives of this working group are to boost the csr procedures of each of the companies and promote synergies whenever
possible


1741 general environmental policy

in the materiality analysis the general policy for the environment was classified amongst the priorities and environmental training
for employees was included amongst the important challenges for the eurotunnel group


governancesteering
above and beyond compliance with the legal and regulatory constraints for which a review is conducted and published each
month esgie true to its constant commitment to the environment created a safety and sustainable development department
in 2006

the general policy of europorte subsidiaries on both sides of the channel lays down environmental considerations that require
europorte to be involved in controlling its environmental impacts particularly as regards energy consumption progress on the
resulting environmental action plans is monitored monthly by the europorte safety committee chaired by the europorte chairman
on the french side and by gbrfs executive safety committee on the british side the deployment and the implementation of this
plan are handled within the french subsidiaries by europortes central safety quality and environment department and more
specifically the environment quality service taken up by the regional safety and quality management and coordination and in the
united kingdom by the gbrf safety department


certifications and labels
as early as 2002 the concessionaires installed an environmental management system based on the requirements of the
iso 14001 standard and put in place trained environment correspondents and internal auditors an environmental
requirements clause has also been introduced into agreements with its subcontractors each year targeted audits are carried
out in france and the united kingdom by the safety and sustainable development department in 2015 thirteen internal audits
were carried out  five in the operational divisions and eight on subcontractors

in the united kingdom environmental risk management is at the core of gbrfs operations where any new flow or any
modification to existing flows are subject to analysis of risks including environmental risks with this environmental risk
management system gbrf received the iso 140012004 accreditation without interruption since 2006 the company is audited
on a halfyearly basis by the british standards institute which ensures gbrf implements its environmental risk management
system

with the sqas rail safety and quality assessment system assessment procedure every three years since 2014 for the entire
scope of its french subsidiaries europorte implements a continuous improvement procedure this assessment supplements the
mase and iso 9001 certifications mentioned in section 426 of this registration document

within the framework of the regulatory developments arising from frances grenelle environment round table programme in
september 2013 socorail obtained ecophyto certification for weeding activities conducted on the rail networks of certain ports
and industrial sites the system implemented is intended to limit the use of crop protection products and better control
their impact

17 corporate social responsibility

      risk prevention
      pursuant to french law no 76663 of 19 july 1976 relating to installations classified for the protection of the environment icpe
      both terminals in coquelles and sangatte are designated icpe sites due to the potential dangers and risks that their activities may
      pose to the surrounding area and to health safety nature and the environment such as refrigeration airconditioning storage and
      use of flammable liquids workshops and paints these activities are set out in a list which on the basis of the severity of the
      dangers or risks that they may represent requires eurotunnel group to either report to or request authorisation from the prefecture
      of the pasdecalais in respect of them these activities are monitored by the regional authority for the environment planning and
      housing dreal similarly pursuant to french law no 923 of 3 january 1992 on water the concessionaire fm must request the
      authorisation from the relevant administrative authority for any proposed construction works or activities to be carried out outside
      of the icpe area which may pose a danger to public health and safety endanger the free flow of water reduce the availability of
      water substantially increase the risk of floods or seriously damage the quality or diversity of the marine environment

      regarding the costs undertaken to prevent the environmental impact of the companys activities these were incurred during the
      tunnels construction the system notably includes separate networks for collecting rain and waste water retention ponds and
      treatment plants

      the group has made no provisions against environmental risks nor did it pay out any courtordered compensation for
      environmental damage during the course of the year the obligation to establish a financial guarantee as defined in article l 5161
      of the french environmental code against any environmental damage does not apply to the groups activities

      no fine of any nature has been imposed nor the group not has it been reported for noncompliance of its operations


      employee awarenesstraining
      as part of their induction to the company every new employee learns about the companys environmental policy its targets and
      the organisation put in place to minimise the environmental impacts of its activity


      1742 climate change and energy policy

      groups challenges and policy
      the materiality review identified the management of energy consumption and the increased use of renewable energies as very
      important and important priorities respectively

      as part of its commitment to lowcarbon transport the group pursues an ambitious strategy combining the development of its
      core activity crosschannel transport with external growth in its two main businesses and areas of expertise other than the fixed
      link infrastructure management and railways operations in line with this strategy the eurotunnel group and the europorte
      subsidiaries are developing a broadbased offering of rail freight transport and associated logistics services throughout france
      and the united kingdom


      actions and means implemented
      emission level measurement
      the eurotunnel group is developing a policy for monitoring and managing the greenhouse gas emissions of its subsidiaries in
      anticipation of the publication of the implementing regulations of article 228  ii of the grenelle 2 law regarding the disclosures
      required from any entity providing transport services or organising the provision of transport services on the quantity of carbon
      dioxide emitted by the modes of transport used to carry out that service

      the eurotunnel group is certified as carbon trust standard since 2009 in 2011 the groups management of greenhouse gas
      emissions was audited by this independent organisation that set the baseline level of greenhouse gas emissions for the whole of
      the groups activities at 2010 levels in 2015 for the fixed link scope eurotunnel groups carbon trust standard certification was
      renewed in recognition of its carbon footprint reduction policy for the period 20132014

      furthermore the eurotunnel group is the sole crosschannel operator to have conducted and published a carbon footprint
      assessment in france and the united kingdom an exhaustive carbon footprint assessment of the fixed link was performed in
      2007 itself using the method developed by ademe this carbon footprint assessment identified the fixed links primary sources
      of greenhouse gas emissions this was followed by the implementation of an action plan focused on two factors that accounted
      for 80 of the emissions namely the use of energy provided by electricity and fossil fuels and refrigeration fluid leakages

in the united kingdom the concessionaires as managers of infrastructure of major importance to the british economy were
asked by the british department for environment food and rural affairs defra in line with the 2008 climate change act to
carry out a study of its infrastructures ability to withstand the foreseeable effects of climate change

in 2015 gbrf ordered a full energy audit as part of the energy saving opportunity scheme regulations esos by independent
experts to prepare for its accreditation in 2016 this procedure identifies the main risks and opportunities for the company as
regards energy savings and environmental impacts and provides a benchmark for measuring the outcome of its programme to
enable continuous improvement

in keeping with the 1992 montreal protocol actions were implemented to reduce emissions of all gases leading to ozone layer
depletion by the same token halon will be phased out in 2016 from the fixed link infrastructures and rolling stock also the
refrigerants used in the cooling ducts in sangatte and shakespeare cliff will be replaced by new cooling units that are more energy
efficient and have no negative impact on the environment


customer offer
the group is committed to leading the way in environmentally responsible transport and makes its expertise and leadership
available to its subsidiaries and customers to help them reduce the carbon footprint of their activities

an ecocomparison tool is available on the fixed link website and can be used by customers to calculate the average savings on
co2 emission levels in using the passenger shuttles

since 2015 eurotunnel group provides passengers with electric cars with a fast recharge facility free of charge at the fixed link
site in coquelles pasdecalais and in folkestone kent  in thirty minutes they can charge 80 of the battery capacity
universal battery chargers with a range of over 250 km there are sixteen dedicated spots that can be used simultaneously at the
two terminals of the channel tunnel these are the only sites in europe to provide such a comprehensive offering the number of
customers using the passenger shuttle in electric cars increased from 40 in 2014 to 800 in 2015 this number is expected to reach
2000 in 2016

in 2014 europortes french subsidiaries applied for the tk blue label established by the european tk blue agency this label is
used to produce the tkblue index that measures technical economic environmental and social performance of its transport
services


energy policy
comprehensive energy audits spanning the full range of energy consumption for the concessions operations  going beyond the
regulatory requirements  were conducted in 2015 by an external auditor the conclusions will be made known during the
year 2016

in connection with the purchase of three shuttles energy savings certificates were allocated in 2015 to edf other initiatives are
underway notably the purchase of electronic variable speed drives for system engines as explained in chapter ii of this
registration document wind tunnel studies were also carried out on the rolling stock with a view to replacing the pagodas with
reflectors to improve penetration specific data sheets to be validated by the regional authority dreal at the end of 2015 the
fleet of 100 electric vehicles operating on the concession terminals reached 35 units  31 in coquelles and 4 in folkestone

europorte france has set up an ecodriving initiative to increase awareness among highspeed train drivers regarding the impact
of their driving behaviour on fuel consumption this initiative will also include the installation of technical equipment to cut down
fuel consumption by locomotives as well as driver assistance systems depending on the railways network and the train so that
drivers can adopt a more environmentallyfriendly driving behaviour in 2015 europorte france also commissioned  a first in
france  seven medium horsepower locomotives in a new model vossloh de18 which for an equivalent level of use provide a
15 to 20 reduction in fuel consumption

      the eurotunnel group constantly strives to limit the impact of its activities on the environment this year however the groups
      ghg emission levels rose 11 compared to the previous year an increase largely due to a growth in activity

      it is noted however that efforts are continuously being made to reduce the energy consumption of the group and consequently
      reduce co2 consumption thus for example actions were undertaken during the year 2015 and should continue in 2016
      particularly in the fixed link including the replacement of halon with less polluting gas an investment of more than e40000 was
      also made to replace certain refrigerants moreover tests have been carried out since 2015 to equip the onboard air conditioning
      systems with gsm datacards that will take readings every two hours of the pressure and temperature of the generators this will
      minimise leakage by detecting them more easily and quickly

      from the time the truck shuttles were put into service eurotunnel has enabled savings of nearly 34 million tonnes of co2
      compared to ferries and since 2006 the groups carbon footprint and ghg emission levels have fallen by 55

      as mentioned in the introduction to this chapter the eurotunnel group was selected in december 2015 by euronext to join the new
      version of the low carbon 100 europe index in recognition of its commitment in the area of climate change

      water consumption taken from the public network has increased slightly compared to the previous year 3 mainly due to
      increased work on the terminal 2015 project in france consumption taken from the underground water table rose 9 across the
      group this is mainly due to the emptying and refilling required as part of the valve replacement cycle which uses a significant
      amount of water

      in addition water offtakes respect the relevant legal constraints

1743 circular economy and waste management

groups challenges and policy
according to the findings of the materiality analysis the circular economy policy and waste management were included among the
important challenges for eurotunnel group the group has a waste collection and treatment strategy that prioritises recovery or
reuse most waste products come from industrial activities and vary in type and quantity from year to year depending on the
projects being undertaken


actions and means implemented
in france the fixed link segregates nonhazardous industrial waste 96 of which is recycled as briquettes used in industrial
boilers this process could be implemented following the emergence of new solidrecovered fuel srf sectors there are three
ways of recovering waste  improved segregation waste buyback and outlets recycling or free takeback

for europorte almost all the waste produced comes from the maintenance of rolling stock and rail infrastructure at industrial
sites waste management procedures are generally the responsibility of the customer europorte applies its own waste
management procedures to its port rail infrastructure services at dunkirk nantessaint nazaire and le havrerouen and
europorte proximites locomotive maintenance workshop at arclesgray in both these activities waste is sorted internally and
passed on to a waste service provider for treatment besides the measures to prevent soil pollution were strengthened at the
europorte proximite workshop by setting up a system for drywashing locomotives similarly in the case of gbrf most of the
waste is generated by the maintenance of rolling stock which is handled by subcontractors gbrf monitors the subcontractors
waste disposal slips

the noise of commercial activities and maintenance is also closely monitored around installations a study in 2009 showed that the
activities of the fixed link breached no noise standards either at the edge of the property or in regulated surrounding areas during
the day or at night measurements were taken in compliance with i the technical annex to the ministerial order dated
23 january 1997 on limiting environmental noise by installations classified for environmental protection icpe without derogating
from any of its provisions and ii standard nf s 31 010 of december 1996 on the characterisation and measurement of
environmental noisespecific measurement methods

by the nature of its activities the subject of raw materials consumption and improving the efficiency of their use is one that is not
relevant for the group

1744 protection of biodiversity

groups challenges and policy
in the area of biodiversity eurotunnel group complies with the letter and the spirit of the convention on biological diversity whose
main goals include the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of its elements


actions and means implemented
the concessionaires have large land reserves in france and the united kingdom and have since the tunnels construction
created several dozen hectares of nature reserves for the conservation and development of biodiversity in france nature reserves
are located within the concession perimeter and therefore not open to the public in france the jardins ordonnes with their
sevenhectare lake are a muchused haven for migrating species and an essential nestbuilding site for many birds




                                                                         2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se               155

17 corporate social responsibility

      in the united kingdom the samphire hoe site is a concrete example of the groups determination to take measures to develop
      biodiversity and protect the environment samphire hoe a nature reserve spanning about thirty hectares at the foot of the dover
      cliffs was created using 5 million cubic metres of blue chalk and marl extracted from the channel subsoil when the tunnel was
      bored this strip of land reclaimed from the sea was gradually transformed into a nature reserve the white cliffs countryside
      partnership in charge of the daytoday management of this protected space is supported by many volunteers living in and
      around kent the partnership between the concessionaires and wccp was awarded its eleventh successive green flag award
      in 2015 recognising the high ecological quality of this nature reserve

      samphire hoe attracts over 80000 visitors each year since 2014 a new reception centre financed jointly by eurotunnel and
      heritage lottery fund provides a fullyequipped educational centre for school groups all year round

      in another partnership with wccp the concessionaires are also involved in the upkeep and conservation of the dolls house hill
      site the steep slope overlooking the folkestone terminal facilities whose wildlife and country belong to a site of special scientific
      interest sssi

      the soil and plant life in biggins wood were lifted when the folkestone terminal was built and replanted close by to safeguard this
      remnant of britains primary forest

      the whitemoor marshalling yard in eastern england is managed by gbrf on behalf of network rail this site which is home to a
      large number of protected animal and plant species is classified as a site of special scientific interest sssi

176 csr policy principles challenges and
commitments

csr at the heart of the group plan
corporate social responsibility csr requires companies to integrate environmental and social issues into their business model
and plan a selfregulation initiative which in its early days was adopted on a voluntary basis csr has been enshrined in a
regulatory framework initiated in france since 20012002 by the law on new economic regulations ner the verification of
sociological social and environmental data by an independent third party has gone on to become obligatory for french businesses
following the publication in 2012 of the decree implementing article 225 of the grenelle 2 law and subsequently the ruling of
13 may 2013 eurotunnel group has exceeded this obligation and its initiative goes beyond simple verification

the eurotunnel group places social responsibility at the heart of its activities and in its interactions with its various internal and
external stakeholders and provides clear information about its commitments to its partners employees customers suppliers
shareholders investors territorial collectivities governments associations and communities true to its principles it has operated
a policy for more than twenty years which is both challenging and supportive of corporate social responsibility which it applies in
three main areas the strategic areas of focus linked to its activities
 people ie each of the 3992 eurotunnel group collaborators
 nature in other words the environment and the ecosystems with which its increasing activities interact
 region or all communities with which the group has a relationship particularly in france the uk and europe

the eurotunnel group has developed a csr policy which is based on the respect of fundamental rights as defined by the major
founding international texts the universal declaration of human rights and the international labour organizations declaration on
fundamental principles and rights at work

the eurotunnel group board of directors and its chief executive officer fully support the principles stated in these international
codes and standards the object of this policy is to translate this support into a set of operational procedures defining a common
approach for all group entities

compliance with this policy will be continuously monitored under the close scrutiny of the groups board of directors supported by
the committee for sustainable development stakeholders shall also be informed of the policy via the groups various
annual reports

the csr targets will be defined each year and will form part of the targets set for the directors and managers of the various group
entities they shall be monitored and evaluated during individual annual reviews

each manager shall be charged with ensuring that the stated principles are communicated to all employees and are further
understood and observed by them


challenges
the eurotunnel group has identified five major challenges which correspond to core issues set out in the major founding texts and
the various international frameworks and standards global compact grl iso 26000 these challenges can be split into several
categories social regional environmental economic and ethical
 social challenges respect the rights of employees
 regional challenges develop close links with the region
 environmental challenges reduce the impact of the business activity on the environment
 economic challenges manage relationships with customers
 ethical challenges continue with policy development and value sharing within the group in connection with stakeholders

answering these challenges has been and remains a priority for eurotunnel group which since its inception has been committed
to a social responsibility policy reconciling economic performance social equity and environmental protection as part of a
programme of continuous improvement


social challenges
for the group responding to the social challenges involves a commitment to fully support a work environment which fosters the
personal development and growth of its workers the human resources policies are developed on the basis of criteria which
support truly equal opportunities and treatment for all employees in its charter of ethics and behaviour eurotunnel group has
effectively committed itself to combating all forms of discrimination in the same charter it strongly reasserts its adherence to the




                                                                         2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se                165

17 corporate social responsibility

      principles and values of the universal declaration of human rights 1948 and to the fundamental conventions of the international
      labour organization as well as to the principles of the united nations global compact

      in order to reinforce the development of its workers and to guarantee a stable and safe working environment for them eurotunnel
      group has made the issue of improving security and health at work a major concern with the renewed and expressed target of zero
      accidents mindful of the progression of its employees performance the group considers the individual annual review to be an
      essential management tool for human resources and has therefore set a target for all managers in the company of 100 reviews

      the group invests heavily in young people and is developing its relationships with universities and schools with the aim of fostering
      a better understanding of its business and of better integrating young people into the world of work this is why an agreement was
      signed in january 2013 with the ecole nationale des ponts et chaussees creating for a period of 5 years an education and research
      chair for the science of railway transport dedicated to the study of railway activity the aim of this chair is training and research on
      the topics associated with infrastructure transport service this initiative attests to eurotunnel groups willingness to share its
      expertise in order to advance science and innovation and position the railway sector as a forwardlooking business

      the eurotunnel group also is also strongly focused on training for careers in the railway sector created by the group in 2011 the
      international railway training centre ciffco contributes to the creation of skilled jobs and professional integration it plays a
      leading role in the development of railway transport and its associated businesses and more generally plays a part in the
      economic development and influence of the nordpasdecalais region


      regional challenges
      as a committed partner in its economic and social environment eurotunnel group has always been a leading economic actor and
      local employer as part of its mission it fully subscribes to a logic of community involvement understood as defined by
      iso 26000 proactive outreach work undertaken by an organisation within the community with the aim of preventing and solving
      problems fostering partnerships with local organisations and stakeholders and being a good citizen of the community

      the eurotunnel group has contributed to the creation of several thousand direct indirect and induced jobs in kent and the calais
      region and has as part of its role as a developer strongly contributed to the growth of the local economy at either end of the tunnel
      and to the positive transformation of the environment in which it operates

      the eurotunnel group is conscious of the fact that community involvement is not limited to responsibility for the impact of its
      activities on the environment but involves responsible behaviour and good citizenship it is also constantly seeking ways to
      strengthen its integration into its immediate environment by means of firm commitments and actions of solidarity geared towards
      the community the group also supports education and culture and is conscious that sharing knowledge is a factor which
      promotes more equal opportunities

      the eurotunnel group estimates that its regional commitment is essential as it contributes to the companys overall performance
      to the internal climate and social cohesion and to the loyalty of its employees

      in order to meet these challenges eurotunnel group is committed to strengthening links with local communities by actively
      supporting associations schools universities and organisations with which it closely collaborates on both sides of the fixed link


      environmental challenges
      in a world with limited natural resources companies cannot ensure their continuity without making constant efforts to control their
      energy consumption and reduce the impact of their activities on the environment for eurotunnel group it is clear it is impossible
      to have success in the long term without better control of environmental impacts

      committed to lowcarbon transportation the group is pursuing an ambitious strategy which combines developing its core
      activity  crosschannel transport  and external growth beyond the fixed link in its two major disciplines and areas of expertise
      the management of infrastructures and railway operations

      prior to the construction of the tunnel expense was incurred in order to prevent the harmful consequences of business activities
      for the environment there are two separate sewer systems for storm water and waste water retention ponds treatment stations
      etc furthermore an environmental management system based on the requirements of standard iso 14001 was put in place by
      the concessionaires in 2002

   consumption increasing its fleet of electric vehicles and optimising waste management

 to strengthen actions which support the protection of diversity

in addition to these commitments the eurotunnel group will pay special attention to the environmental approach of its suppliers
and will ask them to implement actions which would support the protection of the environment


economic challenges
the eurotunnel group places a focus on each individual customer at the heart of its development plan quality of service is both an
everyday and a strategic priority and expectation for its teams within all of its subsidiaries

rooted in a binational culture where the concept of customer prevails the eurotunnel group is continually investing in adapting
its offer the quality of customer services punctuality smoothness comfort and security around a central objective to constantly
increase the high level of quality of service which forms the basis of its economic growth a golden rule is applied every innovation

we compared the csr information presented in the management report with the list provided in article r 2251051 of the french
commercial code

article r 225105 paragraph 3 of the french commercial code

we verified that the csr information covers the scope of consolidation ie the company its subsidiaries as defined by
article l 2331 and the controlled entities as defined by article l 2333 of the french commercial code within the limitations set
out in the methodological information presented in the chapter 17 of the management report


conclusion
based on the work performed and given the limitations mentioned above we attest that the required csr information has been
disclosed in the management report


2 conclusion on the fairness of csr information
nature and scope of our work
we conducted ten interviews with the persons responsible for preparing the csr information in the departments in charge of
collecting the information and where appropriate responsible for internal control and risk management procedures in order to
 assess the suitability of the guidelines in terms of their relevance completeness reliability neutrality and understandability
    and taking into account industry best practices where appropriate
 verify the implementation of datacollection compilation processing and control process to reach completeness and
    consistency of the csr information and obtain an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures used
    to prepare the csr information

we determined the nature and scope of our tests and procedures based on the nature and importance of the csr information with
respect to the characteristics of the company the labour and environmental challenges of its activities its sustainability strategy
and industry best practices

regarding the csr information that we considered to be the most important and presented in appendix
 at parent entity level we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information
  organisation policies actions performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified using sampling
  techniques the calculations and the consolidation of the data we also verified that the information was consistent and in
  agreement with the other information in the management report
 at the level of a representative sample of entities1 selected on the basis of their activity their contribution to the consolidated
  indicators their location and a risk analysis we conducted interviews to verify that procedures were followed correctly and to
  identify potential undisclosed data and we performed tests of details using sampling techniques in order to verify the
  calculations and reconcile the data with the supporting documents the selected sample represents 78 of headcount and
  between 56 and 81 of the quantitative environmental information published

for the other consolidated csr information we assessed its consistency based on our understanding of the company

we also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any information that was not disclosed either in whole or in part

we believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes used based on our professional judgement were sufficient to provide a
basis for our limited assurance conclusion a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive
procedures due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control systems the
risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the csr information cannot be totally eliminated


conclusion
based on the work performed no material misstatement has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the csr
information taken as a whole is not presented fairly in accordance with the guidelines

      as at the date of this registration document the get se share capital comprised 550000000 shares as at 31 december 2015
      the get se share capital comprised 550000000 shares and the theoretical number of voting rights to be used to determine the
      thresholds was 638741746 the total number of exercisable voting rights in general meeting was 627891019

      the difference
       between the theoretical number of voting rights and the number of exercisable voting rights at general meeting is not
         significant it arises from the treasury shares held by get se as part of its share buyback programme described in
         section 2118 of this registration document and the voting rights for which have been suspended and
       between the number of shares comprising the share capital and the theoretical number of voting rights is not significant it
         arises from double voting rights granted to shareholders holding their shares in registered form as indicated in section 2125 of
         this registration document

international financial reporting standards as adopted by the european union

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel groups assets
      and liabilities financial position and results


      notes to the financial statements
      groupe eurotunnel se is the consolidating entity of the eurotunnel group whose registered office is at 3 rue la boetie
      75008 paris france and whose shares are listed on euronext paris and on nyse euronext london the term groupe
      eurotunnel se or get se refers to the holding company which is governed by french law the term group or the eurotunnel
      group refers to groupe eurotunnel se and all its subsidiaries

      the main activities of the group are the design financing construction and operation of the fixed links infrastructure and
      transport system in accordance with the terms of the concession which will expire in 2086 as well as the rail freight activity the
      maritime activity was discontinued in 2015 see note a1 below


      a important events
      a1 cessation of the maritime activity
      in july 2012 eurotunnel purchased three ferries the berlioz the rodin and the nord pasdecalais as part of the asset disposal
      procedure conducted by the french tribunal de commerce following the liquidation of seafrance and subcontracted the
      operation of the ferries to an independent company scop seafrance

      following the decision by the competition appeal tribunal on 9 january 2015 to uphold the prohibition for the eurotunnel group to
      operate any vessel out of the port of dover from 9 july 2015 the group announced its intention to withdraw from its maritime
      activity and to find a buyer for its three ferries the decision of the competition appeal tribunal was upheld on 16 december 2015
      by the supreme court

      during 2015 the process of the groups withdrawal from its maritime activity was as follows
       on 10 june 2015 the eurotunnel group reached an agreement with the dfds group in relation to two of the ferries the berlioz
         and the rodin due to the condition imposed at the time of their purchase in 2012 prohibiting the sale of the ferries for a period
         of five years the agreement provides for the rental of the two ferries from the date of their definitive delivery to dfds with an
         option for their subsequent sale the eurotunnel group is studying the possibility of requesting the paris tribunal de commerce
         to lift the prohibition to sell
       on 1st july 2015 myferrylink ceased commercial operations following the nonrenewal of the contracts between the
         eurotunnel group and scop seafrance
       having been occupied by staff of the scop seafrance until the beginning of september the rodin and the berlioz were only
         handed over to dfds on 15 september 2015 since then the two ferries have been undergoing rehabilitation works and were
         finally delivered to dfds on 9 and 11 february 2016 respectively on which dates their finance leases began
       as a result of the decision by the supreme court in december 2015 the group has been forced to definitively cease its
         maritime activity and has announced its intention to dispose of the nord pasdecalais

      taking into account these events the group believes that during the second half of 2015 the conditions were met for the
      application of ifrs 5 noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations to the maritime activity the activities of the
      myferrylink segment are presented in the financial statements as follows
       the ferries berlioz rodin and nord pasdecalais are treated as assets held for sale and are presented on a separate line of the
         statement of financial position as at 31 december 2015 with no reclassification of the comparative statement of financial
         position as at 31 december 2014
       the net result of the maritime segment for both the current and the comparative financial years is presented on a single line in
         the income statement entitled net loss from discontinued operations
       net cash flows from operating investment and financing activities arising from these discontinued operations for the current
         and the comparative financial years are included in the groups consolidated cash flow statement

      financial information relating to the myferrylink segment is presented in note d below


      a2 simplification of the debt structure
      on 24 december 2015 the eurotunnel group reached an agreement that simplifies the structure of its long term debt by removing
      two of the three monolines ambac and fgic as guarantors of the channel link entreprises finance clef notes the structure
      that securitised the groups debt that was put in place by the lenders in 2007 the consequences of this operation on the term
      loan are set out in note v1 below

                     and liabilities financial position and results


the costs incurred which amount to e123 million will be offset by a reduction in interest rates of 06 on some of the tranches of
the debt

this operation which has not led to a substantial modification of the conditions of the term loan has been treated in the groups
financial statements at 31 december 2015 as follows
 costs that are directly attributable to the operation have been accounted for as an adjustment to the carrying value of the a
    tranches of the term loan and will be amortised over the remaining period to maturity of these debts
 consent fees of e175 million which are not directly attributable to the modification of tranche a of the term loan have been
    accounted for on the income statement at 31 december 2015 under other financial charges
 the part of the transaction fees paid in 2015 amounted to e42 million e175 million of which were consent fees


a3 migrant impact
in the context of the high concentration of migrants in the calais area the group with the support of the french and british
authorities has taken and continues to take the measures necessary to ensure the continuity of its services and the availability of
its installations these measures have incurred substantial capital expenditure and additional security costs for the fixed link
segment during the 2015 financial year the resources involved are either supplied directly by the governments themselves or are
financed by the eurotunnel group and partly reimbursed by the governments the net impact on operating costs for the 2015
financial year is e7 million

the group has also submitted a claim to the two governments via the intergovernmental commission relating to revenue lost as a
result of the disruptions caused by the intrusions by the migrants during the year no revenue has been accounted for this during
the 2015 financial year

      ii use of estimates and judgements
      the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported
      amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period the board of directors
      periodically reviews its valuations and estimates based on its experience and various other factors considered relevant for the
      determination of reasonable and appropriate estimates of the assets and liabilities carrying value

      the actual results could differ significantly from these estimates depending on different conditions and hypotheses the use of
      estimations concerns mainly the valuation of intangible and tangible property plant and equipment see notes n and o the
      evaluation of the groups deferred tax situation note l and certain elements of the valuation of financial assets and liabilities
      note w


      b3 significant accounting policies
      i  business combinations and goodwill
      business combinations are recorded in accordance with the acquisition accounting method as set out in revised ifrs 3 under this
      method the assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value

      goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price over the fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and contingent
      liabilities acquired it is valued in the functional currency of the entity acquired and is accounted for in the statement of financial
      position

      where the fair value of assets liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired exceeds the acquisition price a negative goodwill is
      immediately recorded in the income statement

      costs directly attributable to business combinations are accounted for in the periods operating result


      ii interests in equityaccounted companies
      interests in equityaccounted companies include investments in entities in which the group has significant influence and jointly
      controlled entities these investments are initially recognised at cost of acquisition including any goodwill arising their carrying
      amount is then increased or decreased to recognise the groups share of the entitys profits or losses after the date of acquisition
      should the losses be greater than the value of the groups net investment in the equityaccounted entity these would only be
      recognised to the extent that the group has entered into a commitment to recapitalise the entity

      should there be an indication that an investment is impaired its recoverable value is tested and impairment losses are recognised
      as a deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding investments

      the eurotunnel group presents its share of the net result of equityaccounted investments whose operational nature is an
      extension to the groups activity on a specific line of the income statement between the operating profit and operating profit
      after share of result of equityaccounted companies lines

measured as a whole at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell

costs specifically incurred in the context of the cessation of the activity are presented in the income statement within the net
result from discontinued operations


iv intangible assets relating to commercial contracts
intangible assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the commercial contracts


v tangible property plant and equipment and depreciation
items of property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses property plant
and equipment is depreciated on a systematic basis in order to write down the costs of assets over their expected useful lives
as follows

     the concession expires in 2086
    the depreciation period has been determined for each ferry based on an expected useful life of 30 years from their first date of entry into service

the expected useful lives of the assets are kept under review and revised when necessary according to experience

concession property plant and equipment whose useful life is greater than the duration of the concession is depreciated over the
life of the concession on a straight line basis depreciation on assets whose useful life is less than the duration of the concession
renewable assets is calculated on a straight line basis

as all property plant and equipment will be written down to nil at the end of the concession depreciation of the final renewal cost
of renewable assets will be based on the residual duration of the concession




                                                                                    2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se                        189

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel groups assets
      and liabilities financial position and results


      the calculation for depreciation of the ferries took account of their estimated residual value at the end of their useful lives
      determined on the basis of their scrap value

      subsidies on capital expenditure received during the year have been allocated to the asset to which they relate


      vi impairment of tangible property plant and equipment
      in accordance with ias 36 the carrying amounts of assets and groups of assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to
      determine whether there is any indication of impairment

      in the eurotunnel group each activity segment represents a cashgenerating unit cgu although in certain circumstances the
      cgu may be made up of a single operating legal entity

      if any indication of impairment exists an impairment test is carried out the net book value of the asset is compared to its
      recoverable amount the recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and their value in use the net selling
      price is determined by reference to studies carried out by independent experts

      the value in use of cgus is calculated by discounting operating cash flows after taxation and capital expenditure incurred to
      replace assets as forecast in the cgus business plan and validated by the groups management as part of its operational
      management the period covered by the business plan is three years for concession assets cash flows are extrapolated on the
      basis of an assumption of growth over the residual duration of the concession for nonconcession assets the extrapolation is
      complemented by a terminal value which is calculated on the basis of infinite free cash flows that continue growing at a moderate
      rate below inflation the discount rate retained is the wacc calculated per cgu at each year end an impairment loss is
      recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount

      goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test the recoverable value is calculated for the cgu to which the goodwill belongs


      vii retirement liabilities
      the group provides for its legal and contractual obligations for retirement indemnities of employees under french contracts and
      for the defined benefit retirement schemes of employees under uk contracts operated by ctg and esl and gbrfs retirement
      scheme the liability for defined benefits recorded in the statement of financial position is the present value of the obligation
      under defined benefit plans at the end of the financial year less the fair value of plan assets these liabilities are valued using the
      actuarial method of projected unit of credit on the basis of actuarial valuations made at the end of each financial year the current
      service cost of the period and the interest on the obligation are accounted for in the staff benefit expense line of the consolidated
      income statement valuation of the liability for defined benefit plans in respect of i actuarial gains and losses ii the actual return
      on plan assets and iii changes in the effect of the asset ceiling benefits are recognised in the consolidated statement of other
      comprehensive income


      viii provisions
      provisions are recognised when there exists a legal or constructive obligation stemming from a past event and when the related
      future cash flows can be reliably estimated


      ix financial instruments
      financial assets
      in accordance with ias 39 the groups financial assets have been classified in one of the following four categories
       financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
       loans and receivables
       heldtomaturity investments
       availableforsale financial assets

      the classification defines the accounting treatment of these instruments the classification is designated by the group at the date
      of initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired the purchase and sale of financial assets are
      accounted for on the transaction date being the date on which the group has contracted for the purchase or sale of the asset


      financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
      these are financial assets held by the group for the purpose of generating a shortterm profit or assets designated to this category
      at inception

  financial information concerning the eurotunnel groups assets                                                                               20
                     and liabilities financial position and results


these assets are measured at their fair value with changes in the carrying amount being taken to the income statement

these financial instruments include shortterm treasury investments which are classified as current assets in cash equivalents


loans and receivables
loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not listed on an active market and that are
not held for trading purposes and are not available for sale

these assets are initially measured at their fair value and subsequently at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method for shortterm receivables that do not have a contractual rate of interest the fair value is assimilated to the original
invoiced amount except where the effective interest rate has a significant impact

these assets are subject to impairment tests if there is an indication of impairment losses an impairment loss is recognised
whenever the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount

receivables arising on shares and trade receivables are included in this category they are shown as financial assets and as trade
receivables


heldtomaturity investments
heldtomaturity investments are financial assets other than loans and receivables with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturity that the group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity at the end of the reporting period the group has not
designated any financial asset to this category


availableforsale financial assets
all financial assets that are not classified in another category are classified as availableforsale they are measured at their fair
value unrealised gains and losses are recognised in equity until the assets sale or derecognition however when there is objective
evidence that an availableforsale asset may be impaired the cumulative net loss is recognised in profit or loss impairments on
equity securities cannot be reversed in subsequent accounting periods the impairment criteria defined by the group for securities
and shares securities with variable returns correspond to a prolonged or significant loss for debt instruments the impairment is
only charged to the income statement when impairment is indicated that is related to a counterparty risk

fair value for listed securities equates to the market price for unlisted securities the fair value is determined by reference to
recent transactions or by using valuation techniques incorporating reliable and observable market data however when no reliable
estimate of the fair value of a security can be made it is measured at historical cost these assets are subject to impairment tests
to establish their recoverability

this category includes shares in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and other financial assets


financial liabilities
financial liabilities include in accordance with ias 39
 loans and bank overdrafts
 derivative liabilities


borrowings
borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs and subsequently at amortised cost according to the
effective interest rate method

for financial liabilities that are at a fixed interest rate interest costs are recognised at a constant interest rate until maturity of the
debt using the effective interest rate method the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts all of the contractual cash
flows due on the debt until its maturity these cash flows are calculated on the basis of the estimated cash flows due on each
instrument constituting the debt the calculation takes into account the transactionrelated costs and all other premiums
and discounts

for financial liabilities that are at a variable interest rate cash flows are periodically reestimated to reflect changes in market
interest rates thereby changing the effective interest rate




                                                                            2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se                  191

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel groups assets
      and liabilities financial position and results


      for financial liabilities that are at a fixed interest rate indexed to inflation cash flows are periodically reestimated to take account of
      actual fluctuations in the inflation rate thereby changing the effective interest rate

      a substantial change in the terms of all or part of an existing financial liability is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original
      liability and the recognition of a new financial liability the terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the
      cash flows under the new terms including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted using the original effective
      interest rate differs by at least 10 of the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability if a
      modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment any costs or unamortised fees are recognised in the income
      statement on the extinguishment if the modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment of debt all costs or fees incurred
      adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability


      interest rate hedging instruments
      all the derivative instruments are designed to hedge exposure to interest rate risk they are measured at market value and are used
      as cash flow hedges

      cash flow hedges the derivative instruments designed to hedge the floating rate element of the debt are accounted for as cash
      flow hedges the portion of the gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value that is deemed to be an effective hedge is
      taken directly to equity until the underlying transaction is recognised in the groups financial statements the portion deemed
      ineffective is accounted for in the income statement for the period the gains and losses included in equity are recycled to the
      income statement in the period when the hedged item affects the income statement the interest rate hedging instruments
      described in note v on financial liabilities meet the criteria set out in ias 39 and are therefore accounted for as cash flow hedges


      x sharebased payments
      share options are accounted for in accordance with ifrs 2 the options are valued at their fair value at the date on which they are
      granted see note b4 below and any variations in value occurring after the grant date are not taken into account the value is
      charged to employee benefits expense on a straight line basis between the date of the grant and the maturity date the vesting
      period with an equal and opposite entry directly to equity


      xi treasury shares
      get se shares held by the group are accounted for at cost as a reduction in equity subsequent disposals are taken directly to
      equity and no profit or loss is recognised


      xii foreign exchange
      transactions in foreign currencies are converted into the reporting currency of each individual company at the rate of exchange
      ruling at the date of the transaction assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than those mentioned in
      note b2i above are translated at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting period exchange differences are dealt with in the income
      statement


      xiii revenue recognition
      revenue comprises the value of sales of services in the normal course of business revenue is recognised on the date the service
      is rendered that is to say when the transport occurs therefore when travel tickets are issued for the shuttle activity they are
      accounted for in deferred income


      xiv net gains or net losses on each category of financial instrument
      interest income and charges recognised in profit or loss include
       interest on the financial assets and liabilities accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method the
          calculation of the effective interest rate includes all commissions and margins payable or receivable between the contracting
          parties which are an integral part of the effective interest rate and all transaction costs and all other premiums and discounts
          the transaction costs are the marginal costs directly attributable to the acquisition issue or disposal of a financial asset
          or liability
       changes in the fair value of derivatives categorised as hedges for the ineffective portion


      xv income tax
      income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax income tax is recognised in the income statement
      except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity in which case it is recognised in equity

                     and liabilities financial position and results


current tax
current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
end of the reporting period and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years

additional tax payable on the distribution of dividends is accounted for when the dividends are recognised as a liability


deferred tax
deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes except as provided by ias 12 income taxes

the tax rates used are those in effect at the end of the reporting period

net deferred tax is determined at the level of each tax group

deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future
taxable profits will be available against which the differences can be used at the level of the tax entity

deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses are recognised according to the likelihood of their recoverability assessed on the basis
of the groups budget and mediumterm plans the assumptions in these plans used are the same as those used for testing the
value of assets


b4 measurement of fair value
the groups accounting policies require the measurement of its financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities at their fair value
the fair value has been measured both for their valuation and for the presentation of information in the notes to the accounts in
accordance with the following methods when necessary more detailed information relating to the assumptions used in the
measurement of fair value is given in the notes on the asset or liability concerned


non financial instruments
tangible property plant and equipment
the fair value of tangible property plant and equipment acquired following a business combination is measured by taking the
higher of the net selling price or the value in use


intangible assets
the fair value of intangible assets acquired following a business combination is measured using the present value of forecast future
cash flows after taxation to be generated by the assets concerned


sharebased payments
the fair value of stock option plans is measured by applying the binomial black  scholes model and the monte carlo approach
the basis of calculation includes the share price on the grant date the exercise price of the options expected volatility of the
underlying shares expected period before exercise expected dividends and share yield and the expected turnover of
beneficiaries performance conditions which are not related to the market are not included in the fair value measurement


financial instruments
financial assets accounted for at their fair value are classified in accordance with the following levels of fair value
 level 1 fair value using quoted prices unadjusted observed in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
 level 2 fair value using data inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 which are observable for the asset or
   liability either directly in the form of price or indirectly determined from the price
 level 3 fair value from valuation techniques which rely completely or in part on non observable data such as prices on an
   inactive market or the valuation on a multiples basis for non quoted securities


cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents include cash and shortterm investments with maturities less than or equal to three months from date
of acquisition which do not carry a significant risk of variation in value and which are used by the group to manage short term
commitments money market funds are evaluated at their market value at the end of the reporting period




                                                                         2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se               193

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel groups assets
      and liabilities financial position and results


      trade and other receivables
      the fair value of trade and other receivables is measured on the basis of their expected recoverable value this fair value is
      measured for the purpose of the information in the notes to the accounts as part of the receivables acquired following the business
      combinations


      derivative instruments
      the fair value of hedging instruments is measured on the basis of valuations supplied by the financial counterparties integrating the
      credit risk cva or the counterparty risk dva


      b5 financial indicators
      the main financial indicators used are the following


      i  ebitdaoperating margin
      ebitda or operating margin as used by the group is calculated by adding back depreciation charges to the trading profit


      ii distinction between the trading result and the operating result
      the group considers that it is helpful to include an additional result line in the presentation of its income statement within the
      operating result in order to understand better its financial performance this line is called the trading result and excludes
      income or charges which are nonrecurrent in terms of their frequency and nature and for which the amount is significant the
      group therefore applies recommendation number 201303 of the french national authority for accounting standards the autorite
      des normes comptables


      c basis of consolidation
      companies acquired or formed during the year are consolidated as from their date of acquisition or formation

      for the purposes of consolidation get se comprises the following companies at 31 december 2014 and 31 december 2015

      concession property plant and equipment
      the impact of taxation on property plant and equipment corresponds mainly to the conditions relating to the deductibility of the
      fixed links depreciation costs in the french tax group reintegration of impairment costs and in the british tax group profile of tax
      deductions in respect of depreciation including capital allowances

      deferred tax resulting from temporary differences on property plant and equipment will reverse over the period until the end of the
      concession in line with the profile of the groups depreciation charges and taxable results


      profit arising from restructuring
      the financial restructuring in 2007 gave rise to profit in the consolidated accounts of e3323 million at 31 december 2015 the
      taxation of e1364 million of this amount remains deferred within the french tax group the taxation of this residual profit is
      dependent upon the repayment of a loan between the concessionaires fm and ctg and groupe eurotunnel se which in turn is
      subordinated to the term loan which matures in 2050


      deferred tax in respect of tax losses
      deferred tax assets recognised in respect of carried forward tax losses within the french and british tax groups amount to
      e300 million at 31 december 2015 e51 million for the french tax group and e249 million for the british tax group

      the recognition of these assets for each of the tax groups is based on
       the forecasts of taxable profits derived from the groups threeyear business plan for its different activities this plan is based
         on the same assumptions as those used in the impairment test of assets see note o below on the basis of these forecasts in
         respect of taxable profits the group has recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of carried forward losses which are
         expected to be utilised in the next 3 years for both the french and british tax groups
       the forecasts for use of carried forward losses to cover the reversal of temporary differences on the british tax group

      other temporary differences notably those relating to deferred tax assets on hedging contracts and retirement liabilities are
      recognised on a threeyear horizon

      n intangible assets and goodwill
      n1 intangible assets
      intangible assets represent mainly the estimation of the fair value of the main commercial contracts held by gbrf on the date of its
      acquisition by the group 28 may 2010 this value was calculated on the basis of the discounted future cash flows generated by
      these contracts after deduction of general costs and taxation and using inflation and contract renewal assumptions these
      intangible assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over 12 years being the estimated remaining duration of the contracts
      used in the valuation

      in other operating charges at 31 december 2015 the group accounted for additional depreciation of e1727000 following the
      nonrenewal of one of these contracts

      n2 goodwill
      the goodwill of e19308000 at 31 december 2015 is attached to the cgu represented by the company gbrf

      the group performed a test of value in use of this cgu at 31 december 2015 on the basis of a discount rate of 977
      31 december 2014 95 and a growth rate of 2 the calculations show that the value in use is higher than the carrying value of
      the goodwill

      the group also carried out a sensitivity analysis on reasonably possible changes to key assumptions discount rate and growth
      rate of plus or minus 1 this analysis did not reveal a likely scenario which could lead to an impairment of goodwill

     including f3065 billion of exceptional depreciation on tangible fixed assets


at 31 december 2015 eurotunnel did not identify any indication of impairment of its tangible concession assets but nevertheless
carried out a valuation in order to ensure that the recoverable value of the assets remained higher than their net accounting value

the valuation carried out at 31 december 2015 confirmed that the recoverable value of assets remained higher than their net
accounting value on the basis of a discount rate of 653 31 december 2014 677 and on the basis of revenue growth of
approximately 2 for the period after the three year plan

the group also carried out a sensitivity analysis on reasonably possible changes to key assumptions discount rate and revenue
growth rate of plus or minus 1 as well as changes in the exchange rate between sterling and euros of plus or minus e010 this
analysis did not reveal a likely scenario which could lead to an impairment of concession assets

      expected cash outflows and risks associated with pension liabilities
      the investment strategy for managing the assets of the pension schemes is defined by the trustees of the pension fund the
      maturities of the contributions and the level of funding of schemes are negotiated between the group and the trustees on the basis
      of actuarial valuations carried out every three years contributions are intended both to recover the deficit related to rights acquired
      in the past and to cover the service costs in future years

      the group estimates that contributions to be paid into the defined benefit schemes in the 2016 financial year will be e11 million of
      which e8 million will be in respect of current service costs for the period and e3 million will be in respect of the recovery of the deficit
      in the channel tunnel group pension fund the weighted average duration of both the esl plan and the gbrf plan is 22 years

v1 description of the loans
i  term loan
during its financial restructuring in june 2007 eurotunnel put in place longterm loans of 15 billion and e2 billion collectively
known as the term loan this loan comprised tranches indexlinked to inflation tranche a fixed rate tranches tranche b
and variable rate tranches tranche c with maturities varying between 2041 and 2050 in august 2007 all the tranches of the loan
were purchased by a debt securitisation vehicle created for the purpose by the lenders channel link entreprises finance clef
certain of the notes issued by clef as part of this securitisation were guaranteed by three monolines who in return for their
guarantee received a commission over the life of the loans

the financial operation concluded on 24 december 2015 led to the withdrawal of two of the three monolines from their roles as
guarantors of the clef notes this operation led to changes to the structure of the term loan and to certain of its terms
 the gbp indexlinked tranche totalling 750 million formerly tranche a1 was divided into three new tranches tranches a1 a2
   and a3 with nominal values of 300 million 150 million and 300 million respectively
 the eur indexlinked tranche totalling e367 million formerly tranche a2 was divided into three new tranches tranches a4 a5
   and a6 with nominal values of e73 million e147 million and e147 million respectively
 the contractual interest rate of the three new tranches a1 a2 a4 and a5 was reduced by 06

the fees incurred to the renegotiation of the a tranches as described above totalled e123 million of which e25 million was paid on
24 december 2015 e19 million will be paid in 2016 and e79 million will be paid over the remaining life of the tranche a loans

as the new conditions of the indexlinked tranches of the term loan do not constitute a substantial change in their terms this
operation has been accounted for as a renegotiation of the existing loan and the associated costs have been added to the carrying
amount of the loan and will be spread over its remaining life

undertakings and prohibitions under the term loan
the term loan provides for a number of undertakings and prohibitions which are customary for this type of financing these
relate to
 the creation of new or the continuation of existing guarantees on the assets of the eurotunnel group
 to the transfer of the assets of the eurotunnel group and to the acquisition by the eurotunnel group of new assets
 to the granting of loans guarantees or warranties to third parties and
 the amendment of contracts which were conditions precedent for utilisation of the loans under the term loan including
    inter alia the railway usage contract

in relation to the term loan the eurotunnel group must respect two financial ratios only the first of which see section on event of
default and acceleration below if not met would constitute an event of default the second ratio is the lower of the ratio of
operating cash flow to the total debt service on the term loan including the additional margin applied to tranche c of the debt
since 2012 and the ratio of operating cash flow to the total debt service on the term loan taking into account the hypothetical
amortisation on the term loan and on the basis of a rolling 12 month period prior to the date of the test get se is required to
ensure that at each sixmonthly test date since 31 december 2007 this ratio is not less than 125 for the purposes of this test the
ratio is calculated failure to meet this ratio on a sixmonthly testing date would lead to restrictions on the use of the groups
excess available cash flow on the date of the next interest payment on the term loan until such time as the test is met once again
these restrictions include in particular the ability of the eurotunnel group to pay dividends and to finance new activities failure to
meet this test on three consecutive six monthly testing dates would trigger a prepayment event under which the groups excess
available cash flow would have to be used towards prepayment of the term loan until the testing date on which the ratio is met
once again

in accordance with ifrs 13 the group takes into account credit risk dva and counterparty risk cva in the valuation of financial
instruments in practice this recommendation particularly affects the valuation of derivatives to the extent that they are measured
at fair value including a probabilistic weighting of estimated cash flows

in the case of a default by the eurotunnel group counterparties to the hedging contracts have priority over all holders of debt and
securities and guarantees granted to holders of debt under the concession contract and the intercreditor deed in this respect

      on 28 june 2007 eurotunnel took out the term loan for 15 billion and e2 billion with a spread of 139 basis points on
      28 june 2012 the margin on the c1 and c2 tranches of the term loan changed to 339 basis points this debt is accounted for at its
      amortised cost

      the term loan is not quoted or traded on an active financial market and it is particularly difficult to identify any observable market
      equivalents taking into account the specificities and characteristics of the eurotunnel groups debt and in particular its 30 to
      40year maturity profile see note x2 below

      the groups estimate of the fair value of the longterm loan is based on a level three fair value

      the modelling techniques used involve the discounting of future cash flows determined at the calculation date the discounting
      parameters are derived from a zerocoupon curve and an estimated credit spread based on a sample of comparable bbb rated
      companies the eurotunnel groups rating has remained unchanged since 2007 with an adjustment to take into account the
      particularly long maturity of the groups debt

      on this basis the eurotunnel group estimates the fair value of the term loan to be e5189 million compared to a carrying value at
      31 december 2015 of e4017 million as an indication if the rate used including the credit spread was 100 basis points higher the
      fair value of the term loan would be approximately e630 million lower with regard to the methodology used the eurotunnel group
      does not prejudge the conditions that may be obtained on the market furthermore the characteristics of the current funding
      agreements govern any prepayment or refinancing operations on the term loan and the resulting gains that may arise for
      the group

approximately half of the eurotunnel groups revenues are denominated in sterling whereas more than half of its operating
expenses and capital expenditure are in euros the term loan is denominated in sterling for a total of 1452 billion and in euros for
a total of e1909 billion at 31 december 2015 all the external financial instruments are denominated either in sterling or in euros as
a result no exchange gain or loss can arise on revaluation of the external financial instruments the residual foreign exchange risk
relates to the revaluation of intragroup balances the residual value of which at 31 december 2015 is e22 million a 10 change in
the eurosterling parity would result in unrealised exchange gains or losses of approximately e2 million

the eurotunnel group has and will continue to make every effort to closely match the currencies in which its revenues and costs
are denominated and will use currency hedging transactions to manage its foreign exchange risk where necessary groupe
eurotunnel se prepares its consolidated accounts in euros fluctuations in the value of the sterlingeuro rates have an impact on
the value in euros of revenues costs and financial income and costs as well as on elements of the groups reported assets and
liabilities by way of example and all else being equal and on the basis of accounting information at 31 december 2015 the table
below presents the effect that a change of plus or minus 10 in the exchange rate would have on the main financial indicators

     tranches a1 and a2 are indexed with inflation and are presented in the liquidity table on the basis of the groups medium and long term budgetary
      assumptions
    tranches c1 and c2 are at a variable rate of interest and are presented in the liquidity table on the basis of forecast longterm interest rates


the credit agreements allow on condition that the debt service cover ratio is not less than 125 to apply for i a renewable credit
line of up to e75 million and ii a structurally subordinated additional credit line of up to 225 million or equivalent in euros


x3 interest rate risk exposure
the risk of an unfavourable movement in rates during the duration of the term loan is covered by the fact that tranches b1 and
b2 are at a fixed rate of interest the a tranches which are indexed on inflation are at a fixed rate of interest and tranches c1 and
c2 are at a variable rate of interest but are covered by fixedvariable rate hedging contracts shortterm receivables and debts are
not at risk from interest rate exposure

the contractual cash flows associated with the swaps are paid simultaneously with the contractual cash flows of the variable rate
loans and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period where the interest on the debt affects
the result

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel groups assets
      and liabilities financial position and results


      an increase of 1 in rates would lead to a change in the portion accounted for in equity relating to the derivative instruments of
      e368 million a decrease of 1 in rates would lead to a change in the portion accounted for in equity relating to the derivative
      instruments of e348 million

      the notes in other financial assets carry a variable rate of interest and a change of 1 in rate would lead to a change in
      financial income on the income statement of e18 million


      x4 inflation risk
      the inflation risk relates to the interest and the repayments of principal on the indexed tranches a1 to a6 denominated in pounds
      and euros by way of example a variation of 1 in the inflation rate would have an impact of e17 million on the amount of the
      principal of these tranches


      x5 credit risks

      fails to honour its contractual obligations


      i   trade receivables

      following exceptions
       the groups main customers the railways accounted for 26 of the groups revenue in 2015
       passenger shuttle car customers pay for their tickets in advance in particular via the internet consequently the credit risk in
          relation to these customers is very limited

      the group applies a credit policy which requires that every new customer is subject to a credit check before being able to benefit
      from the groups standard credit terms the groups credit risk exposure to account customers is managed by means of
      continuous monitoring of their financial situation and of their outstanding debt in regard to their credit limits and payment terms


      ii investments

      of 6 months with counterparties with a minimum shortterm rating of p1 from moodys or ii in monetary sicavs the french
      equivalent of mutual funds and money market funds with a minimum longterm rating of aaa from moodys or aaa from sp

      funds invested by the group in any one monetary sicav or money market fund should not exceed 100 million per sicav or fund
      in pounds sterling or e120 million per fund or sicav in euros investments in short term deposits or certificates of deposit should
      not exceed 75 million or e100 million with any one bank group

      a important events
      cessation of the maritime activity
      in july 2012 eurotunnel purchased three ferries the berlioz the rodin and the nord pasdecalais as part of the asset disposal
      procedure conducted by the french tribunal de commerce following the liquidation of seafrance and subcontracted the
      operation of the ferries to an independent company scop seafrance

      following the decision by the competition appeal tribunal on 9 january 2015 to uphold the prohibition for the eurotunnel group to
      operate any vessel out of the port of dover from 9 july 2015 the group announced its intention to withdraw from its maritime
      activity and to find a buyer for its three ferries the decision of the competition appeal tribunal was upheld on 16 december 2015
      by the supreme court

      during 2015 the process of the groups withdrawal from its maritime activity was as follows
       on 10 june 2015 the eurotunnel group reached an agreement with the dfds group in relation to two of the ferries the berlioz
         and the rodin due to the condition imposed at the time of their purchase in 2012 prohibiting the sale of the ferries for a period
         of five years the agreement provides for the rental of the two ferries from the date of their definitive delivery to dfds with an
         option for their subsequent sale the eurotunnel group is studying the possibility of requesting the paris tribunal de commerce
         to lift the prohibition to sell
       on 1st july 2015 myferrylink ceased commercial operations following the nonrenewal of the contracts between the
         eurotunnel group and scop seafrance
       having been occupied by staff of the scop seafrance until the beginning of september the rodin and the berlioz were only
         handed over to dfds on 15 september 2015 since then the two ferries have been undergoing rehabilitation works and were
         finally delivered to dfds on 9 and 11 february 2016 respectively on which dates their finance leases began

      as a result of the decision by the supreme court in december 2015 the group has been forced to definitively cease its maritime
      activity and has announced its intention to dispose of the nord pasdecalais

      get se financed the acquisition and rehabilitation of the three ferries in 2012 and assured the financing of this activity until it
      ceased in july 2015 with an intragroup loan to its subsidiary eurotransmanche holding sas

      on 2 december 2015 get se increased the capital of its subsidiary eurotransmanche holding sas by e80 million in partial
      compensation for this loan see note e1 below

208 legal and arbitration proceedings

as indicated in section 427 of this registration document the eurotunnel group is or may be involved in administrative or legal
procedures presented in chapter 4 of this registration document the more material of which are detailed below


2081 competition and markets authority

in 2012 the group arranged to purchase certain assets including three ferries belonging to former maritime company seafrance
on 8 november 2012 the french competition authority authorised this purchase subject to certain commitments risks to
competition in the passenger market were ruled out for freight transport the eurotunnel group agreed for a period of five years
not to offer any discounts on its crosschannel rail freight transport rates that would be contingent on the customer also using its
maritime transport service specifically it may not base annual rate negotiations on the volume of freight transported by
myferrylink the eurotunnel group has also agreed not to discriminate in any way against customers who do not use myferrylink
for their crosschannel maritime freight transport to make sure it honours these commitments the prices charged to freight
customers will have to be negotiated by different sales teams for each mode of transport and are covered by separate contracts
an independent trustee is in charge of monitoring these commitments

the matter was referred to the uk competition commission which has since become the competition and markets authority or
cma on 19 february 2013 the cma revealed the results of its preliminary analysis finding that the entry of a new operator
myferrylink would substantially lessen competition and that the sale of seafrance assets to another operator would have been
better for competition in the crosschannel market the group challenged this analysis on 6 june 2013 the cma announced its
decision to ban groupe eurotunnel se or any related entity from directly or indirectly operating ferry services from the port of
dover for a period of ten years using the berlioz or rodin or for a period of two years using any other vessel

following an appeal by groupe eurotunnel se and the scop seafrance on 4 december 2013 the competition appeal tribunal
quashed the cmas decision of 6 june 2013 the tribunal found that the cma by failing to demonstrate that the eurotunnel group
had acquired an enterprise rather than individual assets had not demonstrated that it had jurisdiction in the matter the tribunal
therefore remitted to the cma the question of whether the eurotunnel group had acquired an enterprise

on 27 june 2014 the cma reaffirmed its jurisdiction considering that eurotunnel had taken over seafrance and that this takeover
was within the uk merger rules enabling it to examine the operation the cma concluded that myferrylink must cease its



                                                                              2015 registration document  groupe eurotunnel se        247

      and liabilities financial position and results


      activities in a period of six months from the date of the order being issued by the cma giving its decision the eurotunnel group
      and the scop appealed this decision to the competition appeal tribunal

      to consult with stakeholders the cma issued on 23 july 2014 the draft ruling to ban the eurotunnel group from serving the port of
      dover with its ferries in this context the eurotunnel group made a number of observations to the cma

      on 18 september 2014 the cma issued a final order dismissing all of the observations of the eurotunnel group this order
      prohibits myferrylink continuing its activity and would apply six months after a possible decision rejecting an appeal by
      eurotunnel against the decision of the cma

      on 9 january 2015 the cat recognised the validity of the arguments presented by the group but felt that they were not of a nature
      to quash again the position taken by the cma on 18 september 2014 the cat has obliged the group to withdraw from this
      activity faced with the ban to operate within six months and to value the work done the eurotunnel group decided to seek a
      buyer for the myferrylink company

      on 27 may 2015 the eurotunnel group notified scop seafrance that it would not renew the contracts between the parties with
      effect from 1 july 2015

      on 10 june 2015 the eurotunnel group concluded an agreement with the dfds group for a bareboat charter of two ferries the
      berlioz and the rodin this agreement provides for the rental of two ferries from the date of their final delivery to dfds with an
      option for their subsequent sale the eurotunnel group is considering the possibility of asking the paris commercial court to lift
      the clause which forbids it to sell the ferries

      at the beginning of july 2015 the commercial activity of the myferrylink segment ceased following the nonrenewal of contracts
      between eurotunnel and scop seafrance

2225 assignment and substitution by lenders

the concession agreement provides that each of the concessionaires has the right to transfer the concession agreement or the
rights it confers with the agreement of the states

and payable under the terms of the finance documents ii the concessionaires do not have and cannot procure sufficient funds to
finance the forecasted operating costs of the fixed link and the related finance charges iii it appears that the date of full and final
payment of all claims of the lenders must be postponed for a significant length of time or iv in the event of the fixed link being
abandoned suspension of payments liquidation enforcement of security by other creditors or similar events

with the concessionaires furthermore in accordance with article 19 of the concession agreement as a matter of principle the
concessionaires share equally between ctg and fm at cost price all expenses and all revenues from the fixed link for the period
during which they operate it to this end the consequences of any indirect taxation on the supply of goods or services levied only
on one of the concessionaires will be taken into account in the costs to be shared any equalising payment made between fm and
ctg will be treated as a capital expense or a revenue payment as determined by the tax legislation of the two states

with respect to the period between 2052 and 2086 the concessionaires will be obliged to pay to the states a total annual sum
including all corporate taxes of any kind whatsoever equal to 59 of all pretax profits

22 material contracts

      223 railway usage contract

      the railway usage contract was entered into on 29 july 1987 between the concessionaires and the brb and sncf rail networks
      it sets out the basis on which the railways undertake and are authorised to use the fixed link the railway usage contract
      specifies the conditions under which the concessionaires allow the trains of the railways to use the fixed link from the date the
      railway usage contract came into force until 2052 and the conditions under which the railways undertake to supply certain
      railway infrastructure to the concessionaires and develop certain services

      the railway usage contract also sets out the obligations of the railways with respect to the railway infrastructure and the rolling
      stock utilised to ensure a sufficient level and quality of traffic in the tunnel likewise the concessionaires subscribe to a number of
      commitments relating to maintenance of the fixed link pursuant to the railway usage contract the railways are authorised to
      use up to 50 of the capacity of the fixed link per hour and in each direction up until 2052

      under the terms of the railway usage contract the railways are obliged to pay the concessionaires fixed annual charges and
      variable charges depending on the number of passengers travelling on passenger trains and the freight tonnage carried through
      the fixed link adjustment mechanisms for annual charges are set out in the event that the fixed link is unavailable finally under
      the railway usage contract the railways must pay a contribution to the concessionaires operating costs to this end the
      railways make monthly provisional payments to the concessionaires against operating costs for the current period payments are
      subsequently adjusted to take account of real operating costs with the final amount of the contribution determined in accordance
      with the formula set out in the railway usage contract and agreements reached for its implementation

      the railway usage contract is governed by french law

      in addition the strategy for the relaunch of freight services offers a simplified pricing structure mechanism for goods trains with a
      toll per freight train rather than per tonne of freight based on a charging regime published annually by eurotunnel in its network
      statement

      a substantial majority of the eurotunnel groups revenues emanating from its rail network see chapter 6 is made up of the annual
      fixed and variable charges as referred to above

      in the context of the privatisation of the british railways brb entered into backtoback contracts with certain entities including
      network rail db schenker rail uk formerly ews and eurostar international ltd formerly eurostar uk ltd under the terms of
      which brb delegated to them operational execution of some of its obligations to the concessionaires as part of the agreement
      with the british and french governments regarding the extension of the concession agreement until 2086 the eurotunnel group
      undertook under certain conditions to work with the entities to which execution of these obligations had been delegated to
      ensure the development of passenger train services and goods train services

      in accordance with eu directives governing the liberalisation of the international rail transport market the eurotunnel group
      publishes its network statement annually offering equivalent conditions of access to its rail network as those set out by the
      railway usage contract for other railway companies

      225 master intragroup debt agreement

      intragroup debts existed between the various companies of the group some of them were expressed in contracts concluded
      between 2007 and 2009 for the financial restructuring or simplification of the structure of the group intragroup debts certain
      of these intragroup debts for which contracts were concluded in 2007 were reorganised in 2009 as part of the transactions prior
      to the merger of tnu sa into get se which gave rise to the conclusion of new contracts for intragroup loans

      the intragroup debts because they were concluded over a period from 2007 to 2009 and partly reorganised in 2009 had
      different characteristics as to interest rate and maturity which complicated the financial and accounting management of group
      companies

      group companies have therefore concluded a contract entitled the master intragroup debt agreement the principal object of
      which is the harmonisation of i the rules for current accounts between group companies ii the interest rates of the various
      intragroup debts and iii where possible the other conditions of these intragroup debts in order to facilitate the financial and
      accounting management of group companies and to reflect the financial policy between the groups companies

      further information and methodological limits of the indicators collected
      the methodologies used for some workforce and environmental indicators may in practice be limited by
       a lack of harmonisation in nationalinternational definitions and legislation
       the representativeness of the measurements taken or limited availability of external data needed to calculate the indicator
       the qualitative and therefore subjective nature of some data
       the practical methods used to collect and input this data

      the calculation of emissions of greenhouse gases is based on the methodology developed by the carbon trust

      waste generated by operations on customers sites in respect of monitoring of the activities of contractors is excluded from the
      scope of reporting

      the sites for which natural gas consumption data was not available for all or part of the reporting period have been estimated on
      the basis of average consumption using the ademes bilan carbone method

      water consumption for unmetered sites was extrapolated by applying a ratio of water consumption in m3 per employee present on
      site this ratio was calculated from sites which are metered

      as none of gbrfs sites are equipped with metres europorte frances ratio has been applied as their activities are similar

      gbrfs electricity consumption was limited to sites equipped with a meter however this covers more than 97 of the staff
      attached to a site ie the total number of staff less mobile and home working staff

      a readjustment was made in the year 2015 to integrate the european subsidiaries in the reporting scope of the total wage bill also
      training costs were adjusted following the increased reliability of data for the subsidiary gbrf

      some data which was not available for all or part of the reporting period and which was necessary for the calculation of
      absenteeism frequency rate and the management to staff ratio has been estimated in accordance with the methodologies
      described in the reference sheets

      in the calculation of the rate of absenteeism for the four french europorte entities the number of scheduled hours is obtained by
      multiplying the number of full time equivalent staff by the number of theoretical hours

      the training budget is the sum of logistics costs when available external costs and the related staff costs this last component
      has been estimated in 2013 and 2014 for the entity gbrf on the basis of gross payroll divided by the number of hours worked and
      then multiplied by the total number of training hours conducted by the subsidiary the data for gbrf in 2015 shows the total
      external training costs


      external audit
      in order to ensure that it provides reliable information each year the eurotunnel group requests the opinion of independent third
      party regarding the quality of its workforce and environmental information collection and reporting procedures in 2015 the audit
      was carried out by kpmg the 2015 assurance report expresses reasonable assurance for three environmental and seven social
      indicators information marked  and limited assurance for all other information presented in chapter 17 of this registration
