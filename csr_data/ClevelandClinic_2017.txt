stakeholder engagement

by virtue of our scope and operations cleveland clinic engages many stakeholder groups our stakeholders

and national philanthropic foundations media outlets community groups citizens and others

our stakeholders are directly affected by our operational decisions including individuals and groups with an interest
in our social economic and environmental performance as a community anchor and an economic engine our
operational decisions have far reaching impacts and we interact with these stakeholders to ensure that we address
the needs of our local communities employees and patient base

our stakeholders to attend facility openings addresses by cleveland clinic executives and other clinichosted
events open to the public and other officials we also periodically travel to the seats of federal state and local

materiality

while all sustainability topics discussed in this report are important to our leadership our stakeholder engagement
process has helped us determine what sustainability topics matter most or how material they are to our
operations and where they matter most within our organization and externally beyond our walls this materiality
process has enabled us to prioritize the topics that require the most focus for our longterm success

all interviewed stakeholders were given a list of sustainability topics based on the global reporting initiatives
aspects list and engaged in open dialogue on all topics the internal interview team ranked each topic discussed on
a low to high scale of 1 to 7 and then the mean of all stakeholder answers was utilized to generate vertical and
horizontal points on the graph the opinions of our patients and caregivers were weighted with additional
consideration

the verticalaxis of the chart corresponds to the ranking or importance of a topic to our external stakeholders and
the horizontalaxis corresponds to the importance to our internal stakeholders

the chart is divided into three distinct groups topics to manage topics to set goals and manage and topics to set

goals manage and provide robust discussion in our reporting




several topics emerged that were ranked highly by both our internal and external stakeholders they are the indirect
economic impacts of our operations our engagement with the communities we serve population health research
and innovation access to care quality of care and the inherent link between human health and the health of the
environment other highly ranked topics internally were caregiver engagement clinical transformation patient and
caregiver safety and transparency one important topic that was discussed extensively by our external stakeholders
was the health impact climate change poses to our patients and communities and cleveland clinics mitigation and
resilience efforts

generally the most important topics discussed internally concerned our patients and caregivers and our external
stakeholders cared most about our community and environmental impacts where available we have included
robust discussion and reporting on the topics our stakeholders consider to be the most material to our operations in
this years report because 2016 was the first year we completed a materiality assessment no significant changes to
our material topics have occurred since the last reporting period we will continue to use this materiality process to
guide our reporting and data collection in the future

boundary

the disclosure aspects included in this report are material to our north american operations that are wholly owned
and operated unless noted otherwise we have designed this report specifically with stakeholder boundaries in
mind so that the topics metrics and stories that matter most to our stakeholder groups are prioritized within their
respective sections each group showed the most interest in areas of the report with which they had a direct
connection

  patients are most interested in patient safety and quality of care indicators

  caregivers are most interested in caregiver demographics and caregiver engagement stories

  local community stakeholder groups are most interested in our contributions and impacts on our local
  communities

  national environmental groups are most interested in our environmental performance and commitment to
  transparently reporting our progress

        population health describes when a healthcare provider is responsible for delivering care to a
        predefined group of people  either with the same disease or condition or within the same
        geography population health is affected by many factors including socioeconomic status
        environmental health access to quality healthcare and health behaviors population health
        management has the potential to reduce waste in healthcare delivery and help patients remain
        healthier and out of the hospital

        information technology to better capture the value of data and establish a model for health
        system transition to population health the new technology implementation is designed to enable
        efficient analysis of data from electronic health records ehr information from administrative
        claims and social determinants of health allowing for both personalized clinical care and broader
        populationfocused management for example data analysis could help predict if diabetes
        patients are resistant to certain treatments and whether similarities exist within a group of
        diabetes patients that could help medical providers better tailor patient engagement to address
        specific needs such as notifying of recommended treatments or actions to take

        prediction models

carepaths

        a key component of valuebased care care paths are multidisciplinary plans of care that limit
        variation in care and optimize outcomes by following a care path providers base treatment on
        documented evidence or shared experience to deliver consistent value for a patient or population
        of patients cleveland clinic caregivers across the enterprise are creating care paths for
        delivering care during particular clinical procedures such as total hip replacement or treatment of
        cancer

        the care path initiative focuses on three main objectives

            standardizing physician clinical management with a focus on valuebased patientcentered
            care

            integrating work flows and algorithms into the electronic medical record when appropriate

            tracking patientreported outcomes to improve care quality


        as of 2016 131 care paths have been developed with 35 piloted and 17 fully embedded in the
        electronic health record our complete care program is a team approach that includes the
        patient the surgeon and a specialty care coordinator this bundled treatment plan along with a
        bundled payment plan provides efficient care for the patient



distance health

        technology is transforming where and how we practice medicine through distance health
        cleveland clinic is improving quality and bringing our care to more patients in more locations
        leveraging technology in innovative ways we are expanding the reach of our world class service
        and reducing costs patient entered data apps partnerships and data interrogation tools are
        revolutionizing the practice of medicine and cleveland clinic is at the forefront in bringing these
        capabilities to life in 2016 we increased our telemedicine presence and opened more urgent
        care walkin clinics throughout our community

        among the examples of successful use of health enabling technologies are our mobile stroke
        unit and telestroke services ehospital inpatient critical care monitoring concussion app
        mychart mycare online virtual visits express care online remote image upload and remote
        monitoring for chronic disease management



patientcentered medical home

        a patientcentered medical home might sound like a place or somewhere you would go but it is
        not it is a longterm teambased approach for your primary healthcare patients are engaged
        with their care team across the continuum and have a direct relationship with their provider who
        coordinates a team of caregivers and arranges appropriate treatment as needed

       in 2013 the joint commissions surveyors evaluated us on how effectively primary care
       clinicians and interdisciplinary teams work in partnership with patients to provide comprehensive
       coordinated and patientcentered care the primary care medical home certification was
       launched for hospitals in february 2013 to help improve outcomes reduce healthcare costs and
       ensure patients receive timely and appropriate treatment as an outcome of the joint
       commissions survey 39 medicine institute practices at 29 sites  involving 230 primary care
       physicians and advanced practice nurses  received primary care medical home certification at
       cleveland clinic



shared medical appointments

       shared medical appointments smas offer an innovative interactive approach to healthcare that
       brings patients with common needs together with one or more healthcare providers while an
       individual appointment typically lasts 15 to 30 minutes a shared appointment is 90 minutes long
       allowing participants to spend more time with the healthcare team

       we piloted smas more than 10 years ago and now offer them at several cleveland clinic
       hospitals and family health centers they are quickly evolving as a key component of
       transforming healthcare patients enjoy the opportunity to relate to other patients who are dealing
       with similar health issues they share stories learn from one another and create a kindred bond
       especially for those dealing with chronic conditions like asthma diabetes and hypertension

caregivers
cleveland clinics caregivers work hard to put patients first and maintain our high standards of care every day our
more than 51000 caregivers are our most important resource and cleveland clinic works equally hard to care for

and change lives  beginning with their own that is the power of the
cleveland clinic team and the power of every one we believe people do their best in a workplace where they

active role in support of their own health our policies and programs are designed to make healthy choices easier
for our caregivers as well as offer recovery resources for those whose wellbeing is compromised

employee wellness is not only focused on individual employees but on programs designed to impact the health of
both our caregivers and our patients for example gentle yoga and relaxation therapy are offered to nursing and
medical staff in liver transplant units to reduce stress we encourage all of our caregivers to take advantage of
these programs

and willingness to embrace their roles as caregivers new employees join our caregivers at every level of the
organization throughout their career each individual has the opportunity to work in different departments and hold a
variety of positions our goal is to create an environment where caregivers develop new skills and hone their
expertise as they continue down the career path of their choice many of our caregivers have worked with us for
decades and we are committed to valuing their contributions and developing their careers

persuaded him to allow the police and ambulance to bring him to the hospital to get the care he desperately
needed pam informed the police and physician team of the plan the patient was safely transported to the

professionalism and nursing excellence contributed to saving the husbands life

ecocaregiver

clinic to reduce cost waste and emissions while providing the
highest quality medical care in 2014 we launched an enterprise
wide ecocaregiver training energy savings  you this
mandatory training on energy demand management is required for all caregivers and continued throughout 2016
nine months postlaunch more than 50000 caregivers across the enterprise have completed the training this 15
minute module will be updated and reassigned annually for all caregivers including staff it reinforces an
organizational expectation for an environment of energy conversation and emphasizes the importance of individual
caregiver contribution to our energy demand reduction goals in addition to the training we have developed a
robust communications campaign to prompt desired workplace behaviors

caregiver safety

environmental health and safety

within cleveland clinics enterprise quality we have a formal environmental health and safety ehs team
charged with the implementation and monitoring of ehs management activities at cleveland clinic main campus
and our family health centers in addition each community hospital maintains written management plans that
address the environment of care based on management structure and individual needs

enterprise safety leadership members regularly review regulations and assess the need for changes to general
safety policies equipment procedures training and other activities ultimately the responsibility for environmental
health and safety at cleveland clinic extends through the entire supervisory force to every caregiver only through
a cooperative effort by supervisors and caregivers can an effective accident prevention program be established and
preserved

cleveland clinic also protects our caregivers and patients through risk control efforts related to serious diseases
for example occupational health promotes the health and safety of our caregivers through new hire pre
placement assessments urine drug screenings annual compliance tuberculosis testing audiograms as well as
required immunization and flu vaccinations in addition we established a work restriction policy for caregivers with
communicable diseases a safety event reporting system and postexposure guidelines and support for those
exposed to bloodborne pathogens employees are encouraged to report all exposures and nearmisses and
aggressive postexposure followup procedures are followed



ehs data

cleveland clinics recording and reporting of accident statistics is in accordance with the requirements of the
occupational safety and health administration osha and the bureau of labor statistics bls an injury or
illness is considered to be workrelated if an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or
contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a preexisting condition our injury data presented
below represents the majority of caregivers reflecting our ohio facilities injury rates are listed as the number of
injuries per 100 fulltime employees 2016 includes caregiver data for the newlyacquired akron general health
system aghs

in 2016 cleveland clinic experienced a year similar to 2015 our osharecordable injury rate of 346 and a lost
time injury rate of 056 are well below the us hospital average for 2015 the bureau of labor statistics indicated
the average hospital had an osharecordable injury rate of 60 and a losttime injury rate of 140

there were no workrelated fatalities in 2016 injuries by gender relate closely to our overall malefemale
employment ratios




cleveland clinic absenteeism as measured by unscheduled paid time off upto dropped from 10 percent in
2010 to 067 percent in 2015 but then increased slightly in 2016 when aghs data was included absenteeism can
be used to indicate caregiver health and wellness engagement job satisfaction and workplace effectiveness

bloodborne pathogens




bloodborne pathogen exposures are the most frequent injury type our caregivers experience

in 2015 cleveland clinic adopted a strategic initiative to minimize or eliminate occupational exposures to human
blood blood products and other potentially infectious materials the initiative continued in 2016 reduction
activities include creating 30 hospital and institute bloodborne pathogen exposure teams developing an
implementation guide producing an exposure prevention video evaluating new products distributing personal
protective equipment especially eye protection sharing best practices formalizing incident investigations
developing a data dashboard and chartering a bloodborne pathogens steering committee

with emphasis on reporting bloodborne pathogen exposure event reports have increased approximately 36 since
2015 to approximately 1500 per year ohio locations we expect event reports to plateau and begin to decline in
2017 work will focus on central reporting of bloodborne pathogens exposure events robust use of data incident
investigations best practice sharing and policies and procedures



osha recordable injuries

cleveland clinic also works to reduce the two most expensive injury types that caregivers experience on the job
ergonomic injuries and slip trip and fall injuries ergonomic injuries in healthcare are most likely associated with
patient handling and movement in addition to these we monitor and evaluate injuries associated with moving
objects and those associated with personmachine interfaces such as keyboard activities

in 2016 cleveland clinic published its mobility with safe patient handling msph care path this care path is
intended to provide evidencebased patient care to reduce or eliminate the adverse effects of immobility while
providing caregivers with the tools and techniques to provide care safely all of our medicalsurgical rns take a
msph class as part of their ongoing education

this process and the results it can achieve are highlighted in this video

as you can see from the above graph osharecordable ergonomic injuries dropped significantly throughout the
year the program was also highlighted in our june 2016 connection

starting in 2015 and continuing through 2016 and beyond walking and working surfaces are being evaluated to
reduce the potential for caregiver patient and visitor falls northeast ohio can be treacherous in the winter months
and fall data is somewhat seasonal we see an increase in outdoor falls between november and march each year
however our trend for the year was a nice downward line as indicated in the graph below




our main campus which includes our regional operations facilities such as our family health centers and
ambulatory surgery centers is a magnet hospital indicating it has achieved excellence in nursing practice as part
of our sustained commitment to our rns continuous improvement efforts work to improve caregiver and patient
safety

when we look at just rn data for ergonomic and sliptripfall injuries we see reductions in each of the four quarters
of 2016 as the graph below indicates fewer injuries means less harm to our caregivers and less interruption of
care to our patients

alice

with the sudden rise in active shooter incidents in the united states providing our caregivers with training to
survive such an incident is a top priority at cleveland clinic the protective services department adopted the
alice active shooter response model that was developed by the alice training institute thirtyfive
caregivers from various disciplines across the cleveland clinic health system received alice instructor training
to help facilitate enterprise wide training

the emergency management department in conjunction with the cleveland clinic police department developed a
healthcareoriented alice training module that is used by all of our certified instructors to provide consistency in
the delivery of the material the training is delivered through various media as a module that is embedded in the
annual mandatory online emergency management training as lunchandlearn live training sessions during
monthly department meetings and as wholehouse inservice training

mobile food pantry

stephanie tubbs jones health center stjhc sponsors a
mobile food pantry in east cleveland on the 4th saturday of
each month in collaboration with the greater cleveland food
bank the mobile food pantry operates like a farmers market
but the food is given away to community members for free

the east cleveland community is a food desert lacking easily
accessible grocery stores that provide fresh produce this
disparity impacts the community through high rates of obesity
diabetes and hypertension the mobile food pantry provides healthy meal options for families promotes healthy
eating and improves health outcomes in 2016 we maintained the mobile food pantry year round moving the

ways and the exercise class incorporates normal household items into a routine that can be done at home without
any special equipment

research has shown that adding just two servings of fruits and vegetables a day to your diet can help to combat
most chronic illnesses which makes access to food is not just a social concern but also a medical one said alicia
richardson former stjhc patient navigator dedicated to the mobile pantry and its purpose most importantly

when someone is hungry accessing food becomes their primary concern and their healthcare is put on the back
burner

feed 100150 families in 2016 stjhcs mobile food pantry served 1375 families and 3310 individuals the

came out of it with the knowledge of how to pursue my interests and continue to
better the world i now love the idea of working on public health outreach and i
know that i will use the skills that my mentors taught me of entrepreneurism

not receive elsewhere i met with cleveland clinic executives sat in on city

importance to northeast ohio received such attention opioid abuse continues to be a focus for the
department and our efforts align with the campaign dr murthy discussed

turn the tide rx is a national campaign based on the concept of prescribers talking to prescribers it aims
to educate prescribers about the opioid epidemic and mobilize them to change the cultural perceptions of
addiction so that it is not seen as a moral failing but as a chronic illness that must be treated with skill
urgency and compassion while in cleveland dr murthy discussed appropriate opioid prescribing practices
as well as use of naloxone as a rescue medication

the grand rounds attracted more than 200 participants from not only cleveland clinic but providers and
agencies throughout greater cleveland dr adrienne boissy cleveland clinic chief patient experience
officer joined panelists from the ohio state medical board and a cleveland clinic patient in recovery to
discuss how providers can help to disrupt the crisis of prescription and street opioid addiction in ohio and
across the country

former vice president joe biden visited cleveland clinic langston
hughes community health  education center on june 28 2016 for
an invitationonly event to meet and speak with members of the fairfax
neighborhood

working together with case comprehensive cancer center cccc
partners case western reserve university cwru and university
hospitals uh the clinics monthslong efforts to encourage the
obama administration to include prevention and community outreach as part of its cancer moonshot initiative
culminated in two significant engagements with vice president joe biden first in late june dr cosgrove
participated in the national cancer moonshot summit hosted by vice president biden in washington dc
joining other clinical leaders and stakeholders committed to working towards a cure for cancer and second
the next day brian bolwell md chairman of the taussig cancer institute and the cccc partners welcomed
the vice president to the cleveland clinic langston hughes community health and education center where
he gave his first speech of the moonshot initiative highlighting the importance of community outreach relative
to cancer screening and prevention most importantly the cleveland event with vice president biden was a

recognition of the collaboration between the clinic cwru and uh in the name of cancer research and
prevention

the former vice presidents visit was a particular honor for cleveland clinic and the langston hughes facility
as it recognizes the importance of prevention as well as early detection and intervention in successful cancer
outcomes as championed by cleveland clinic langston hughes provides wellness programming as well as
health screenings including mammography for residents in the fairfax neighborhood being embedded
within a traditionally underserved community helps break down access issues and addresses the health
needs of a population unduly burdened with health inequities



habitat for humanity volunteer day

in july 2016 habitat for humanity volunteers and more than
45 cleveland clinic caregivers painted planted cut cleaned
and mulched flowerbeds for residents on east 87th street in
cleveland thanks to the great work of our caregivers and
the habitat staff 15 homes received attention and were
significantly improved




power washers

the influenza virus was striking schools across the country
during flu season last year forcing several to close their doors
here in northeast ohio teachers called on a band of hygiene
superheroes to help keep their students healthy

power washershelped my students understand the
importance of hand washing says anita giusto a third grade
teacher at andrew j rickoff school in cleveland and they
made the learning fun

water woman super soap and touchy towel  the hygiene
superheroes known collectively as power washers  were
developed for cleveland clinics civic education department by
2008 creative learning intern and beachwood high school
student gabriel firestone the characters star in a series of
online educational resources including a webby awardwinning
music video in which the heroes battle the likes of evil e coli
mr mycosis and sally salmonella and a video game in which
they help players virtually wash their hands

the children loved playing the power washers game says
giusto they especially loved moving the magnifying glass over the hands to see the germs and to hear the
characters say eeeeewwwwww

giustos third graders applied what they learned from both the game and video and put their creativity to the
test developing acrostic poems about the power washers team for water women students came up with
creative phrases such as we like to be clean eat hot dogs but before you eat wash your hands and n o
more germs the students produced some great poems and according to giusto they loved describing a
character through the letters of his or her name

karen straub art teacher at gesu catholic school in university heights also enlisted the help of the power
washers calling on the germfighting trio to assist in teaching her students in prek kindergarten and first
grade about the importance of hand washing

the power washers program engages students right from the start of the video straub says adding
the bios and the game help enforce the concept of hand cleanliness

in the art room straubs students brought the hygiene superheroes to life by creating their very own power
washers puppets students based their puppets on one character straub says and were then able to
use their puppets to say the lines as the video played

water woman super soap and touchy towel may have their own theme song and video game but they
arent the only heroes when it comes to promoting hand hygiene this flu season teachers like giusto and
straub are finding fun creative ways to help keep their students healthy and their classrooms open and that
is nothing short of super



stroke 101

matilda wentz is a lucky woman her grandson is a lifesaver
her lifesaver while matilda was making breakfast for her
grandson sean 14 he noticed that something was off with
his grandmother she was calling things the wrong names
and getting stuck on words

sean remembered the stroke 101 program at claggett
middle school in medina presented by cleveland clinic
community relations this program educates middle school
students to recognize the signs of a stroke and encourages
rapid care to achieve the best outcome matilda had no
telltale signs but her grandson noticed what clinicians call
expressive aphasia

although matilda said she was fine as did another adult in the house sean insisted that something was
wrong matilda was taken to the medina hospital emergency department where clinicians determined she
was having a stroke the ed physicians said that the symptoms were so slight it was amazing that an
untrained person could identify them following treatment and rehab matilda is doing very well thanks in part
to her grandsons attentiveness and persistence

worldwide classroom

the worldwide classroom connected learning program kicked off in
september 2016 and houry gebeshian a physician assistant from
fairview hospital was one of our featured caregivers houry was a
gymnast in this past summers rio olympics civic education was
thrilled that her energetic presentation aligned to the programs new
researchbased emphasis on engaging middle and high school
students through stories they will find relevant humorous gross
inspiring shocking or even a little weird

houry engaged more than 250 students from 11 schools during her
hourlong session sharing her rio experience and how her desire to
be an olympian shaped her journey in becoming a physician
assistant she also lead the students through an activity on how to tie
a surgical knot using her tennis shoe and showed a clip showing how she uses the surgical knot to stitch up
after a csection the most fascinating aspect of the connected learning session came during her q  a with
the students every single question the students asked was focused on her responsibilities as a physician
assistant  not a single question was about the olympics

hourys presentation also leveraged the programs new online polling system at the beginning and end of
each worldwide classroom session students answer three quick questions on their smartphones providing
a snapshot of their pre and postsession understanding of the featured topic or career in the case of hourys
presentation 76 of students answered the postsession questions about the physician assistant profession
correctly compared to only 34 of the students answering correctly beforehand

environment
we understand that environmental health and human health are inherently linked and that we have a responsibility
to take a precautionary approach to environmental stewardship with a built environment portfolio of more than 20
million square feet and more than 51000 caregivers the impact we make on our community and ecosystem both
positive and negative is substantial as a result of our scale we have the opportunity and responsibility to set an
example for other hospitals and businesses even small changes applied broadly can provide significant
opportunities




energy conservation

cleveland clinic was named 2016 energystar partner of the year by the
environmental protection agency our energy conservation program is designed to
enhance patient outcomes and the patient experience while reducing operating
expenses we have committed to reducing our energy intensity by 20 percent by
2020 from our 2010 baseline and at the end of 2016 we were over halfway there at
13 as our model of healthcare evolves we are firmly committed to reducing our environmental economic and
human impact by reducing our energy intensity



climate resilience

climate change has been recognized by the world health organization as one of the greatest threats and
opportunities facing public health this century cleveland clinic is committed to improving our institutionwide
initiatives to prepare for climate change in 2016 we increased our scope 1  2 emissions 05 from 2015 which
is a 7 reduction from our 2012 baseline




waste reduction

we are committed to reducing waste across our healthcare system by engaging our caregivers to minimize the
waste we send to our landfills we are protecting the environment reducing costs and improving land air and water
quality in our communities our goal is to reach 50 landfill diversion or more by 2018

healthy buildings

we recognize that people living in a healthy environment will be healthier people our buildings support the health
of our caregivers patients and communities we continue to grow and set new standards for our buildings and
development we have 4 leed gold and 8 leed silver projects and many new construction projects seek to be
leed silver or higher



responsible procurement

we purchase thousands of different products each year that are utilized throughout the care of our patients we are
working to reduce unnecessary packaging and evaluate our purchasing decisions based on their environmental
impacts so that we can eliminate items that may be toxic to our patients and caregivers



innovative leadership

our involvement at multiple levels from global to local has made us a veritable leader in sustainable healthcare
we work in collaboration with governments nongovernmental organizations ngos and communities to support
strategies for mitigation and adaptation we engage with these groups and provide leadership in both thought and
practice



water stewardship

freshwater resources such as lake erie and the cuyahoga river represent an invaluable local asset that has
shaped clevelands identity both in the way that the city has perceived itself and how it has been recognized
outside the region as stewards of our communitys health we see preservation of our communitys natural
resources as a vital part of our health mission cleveland clinic is actively protecting our water supply through
conservation measures such as condensate recovery and storm water management

energy conservation
cleveland clinics energy management work is an outgrowth of our sustainability commitment to our patients
community and caregivers as population health payment models proliferate the link between energy
pollution and human health intensifies energy efficiency is more aligned to our core mission than ever before

in 2016 cleveland clinic continued implementing a 12m enterprise energy demand reduction strategy to
improve our energy efficiency and become less resourceintensive by decreasing energy intensity cleveland
clinic is providing value for our patients and leading the industry in responsible healthcare operations



reduction progress

energy use intensity or eui measures the energy consumed by a building relative to its size cleveland
clinic uses weather normalized source eui or the total amount of raw fuel used this includes transmission
delivery and production losses of that fuel as it is used as energy our goal is to reduce our eui to 400 by
2020 as of december 2016 we have reduced our eui by 13 from our 2010 baseline our reduction curve
remained flat due to a hotter than average year and our energy reduction measures offset an expected 23
increase

green fund

as a leader in healthcare we are continually looking for ways to improve the health of the communities we
serve and reduce our operating costs in order to make care more affordable for our patients in may 2016
cleveland clinic announced the establishment of a 75 million green revolving fund grf which is the
largest established fund of its kind in the healthcare industry green revolving funds invest in energy efficiency
projects to reduce energy consumption while reinvesting the money saved into future projects as projects
pull money from the fund it is replenished by reinvesting tracked savings from reduced energy consumption
in addition to any rebates received

several projects funded by the grf were key to cleveland clinics early improving the energy efficiency of its
existing buildings they included optimizing building automation systems making targeted reinvestments
utilizing energy starrated lighting appliances and equipment implementing an industryleading led
lighting retrofit strategy and numerous other energy reduction projects and programs listed below

for more information visit the sustainable endowments institutes billion dollar green challenge


progress highlight

cleveland clinics twinsburg family health  surgery center
implemented a variety of energy reduction strategies that
contributed to its overall eui reduction in 2016 twinsburg
fhc reduced its energy intensity more than 23 from year
end 2015 and has reduced its eui nearly 36 from its 2012
baseline the department of energy recently showcased the
project on the better buildings challenge website




light emitting diodes led retrofit

just keeping our lights on accounts for 16 percent of our total energy use the cost of leds has reached the
point where the payback makes sense even in ohio where electricity prices are low relative to other regions
in 2016 cleveland clinic continued standardizing 100 led for new construction and replacing
approximately 400000 fluorescent tubes some of the benefits from this initiative include


  cutting our electric consumption by 28600000 kilowatts each year  roughly the same as removing
  approximately 2600 houses off the electrical grid  for a total annual savings of 2 million

  reducing our carbon footprint by nearly 19400 tons of co2 annually  equivalent to taking 3600 cars off
  the road

  decreasing our waste because led lights last nearly 25 times longer than fluorescent lights  and they
  are mercuryfree which translates into safer disposal

  creating nearly 20 new jobs in our community between 510 in manufacturing and 10 in installation

operating room or setbacks

heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac is the single most energyintensive component in our energy
profile 51 there are 215 operating rooms ors across our health system 86 on our main campus
running multiple cases per day because of the ors requirements for air changes per hour strict temperature
and humidity parameters pressure relationships and energyintensive and often heatgenerating surgical
lighting systems or hvac systems came into sharp focus as our largest strategic priority for energy demand
reduction

in 2016 in collaboration with the surgical operations executive committee the facilities department
continued implementing our or setback plan to reduce energy while maintaining state and federal
regulations for air exchange




lighting setbacks  behavior

building setbacks and caregiver education offer significant energy reduction opportunities we have
programmed our lighting systems to reduce usage during unoccupied periods for administrative areas and
are creating a culture of conservation through an enterprise wide ecocaregiver training initiative



chiller optimization  replacement

in partnership with gardiner trane we implemented several chiller optimizations on main campus and
several other hospitals chillers are machines used for cooling our facilities and contribute a significant
portion of our hvac costs we anticipate savings of 650000year based on internal studies and an external
study performed by a third party



filter optimization

we initiated a filter optimization program to replace highefficiency particulate arrestance hepa filters with
14 high efficiency filters for nonsurgical spaces and utilize a more energy efficient filter package across the
system the conversion is projected to save approximately 23 in fan power for all affected air handling units
with variable speed drives and deliver almost 1 million in savings



retrocommissioning

we optimized equipment condition controls and programmed operating conditions to achieve a 40 savings
at our strongsville family health and surgery center additional facility retrocommissioning is planned in
future

integrated building management system ibms

                                    we integrated meter installations and developed energy
                                    dashboards to provide detailed building by building energy
                                    metering and monitoring this resulted in caregivers
                                    competing to control their respective buildings at the lowest
                                    energy use per square foot

climate resilience
cleveland clinic recognizes that the healthcare sector will be directly and indirectly affected by the impacts of
climate change children the elderly and the disadvantaged will be most at risk and we are likely to see increases
in heatrelated disorders respiratory disorders infectious diseases food insecurity and mental health issues

as a leader in healthcare we understand we have an important role to play and our response to these challenges
will guide the evolution of our organization in the coming decades we will continue to lead our sector and explore
creative solutions to environmental challenges that benefit our community and support economic health our efforts
are strategically aligned with those of our community providing opportunities to collaborate innovate and form
meaningful shared goals



carbon mitigation




cleveland clinics 2016 scope 1  2 carbon footprint totaled 464556 metric tons of co2e this is a 05 increase
from 2015 and a 7 reduction from 2012 76 of our footprint is from purchased electricity 22 is from direct
usage of fuels in assets owned by cleveland clinic and 2 is from anesthesia gases more than 96 of our carbon
footprint is located in northeast ohio in our hospitals family health centers medical office buildings and
administrative facilities

cleveland clinic calculated its scope 1  2 carbon footprint using the ghg protocol for electricity natural gas fuels
used by generators and vehicles and anesthesia gases energy stars portfolio manager was used to calculate
the electricity carbon footprint since it utilizes site specific egrid factors for each location for locations not tracked
in portfolio manager a system average factor was applied to the electricity usage natural gas footprint was
calculated using fuel usage for our owned fleet of patient transport vehicles vans and cars was drawn from our
central fleet management group anesthesia gas emissions were calculated based on purchased cylinder volumes
and intensity factors from carbon footprint from anesthetic gas use study published by uks sustainable
development unit in 2012



energy efficiency

in 2016 cleveland clinic continued implementing a 12m enterprise energy demand reduction strategy to improve
our energy efficiency and become less resourceintensive by decreasing energy intensity cleveland clinic is
reducing our carbon footprint providing value for our patients and leading the industry in responsible healthcare
operations as of december 2016 we have reduced our eui by 13 from our 2010 baseline



sustainable transportation

cleveland clinic is a member of the university circles sustainable transportation action committee stac this
committees mission is to support university circles economic viability visitor experience environmental health and
quality of life by increasing the utilization of sustainable transportation options among all travelers in the university
circle area

in 2016 we conducted a transportation survey among caregivers who commute to work at our main campus
located in university circle we discovered that our drive alone rate was 82 and that there is significant
opportunity to increase our caregivers use of other sustainable modes of transportation this survey serves as a
baseline and will help influence our organizational strategy to achieve its goals

in order to incentivize our caregivers to shift away from singleoccupancy motor vehicle commutes we offer rta
commuter advantage discounts green vehicle rebates and carpool preferred parking and discounts

in 2010 our transportation department implemented an enterprise fleet vehicle savings program in 2016 we saved
over 4111 metric tons of co2e as a result of this program  a 27 increase over 2015



climate action fund

 cleveland clinic was a founding member of the cleveland climate action fund alongside the city of cleveland
cleveland foundation george gund foundation and the greencitybluelake institute at the cleveland clinic
museum of natural history the fund was founded as the first communitybased openaccess carbon reduction
fund in the united states with the goal of improving residents lives while mitigating carbon emissions

since inception in 2008 the fund has invested thousands of dollars towards climate resiliency projects in cleveland
neighborhoods such as kinsman detroit shoreway and glenville cleveland clinic is proud to support this initiative
and work with the city of cleveland on climate resiliency and adaptation for our communities



tree planting

                               in the late 1800s the city of cleveland was
                               nicknamed the forest city however according to
                               the cleveland tree plan cleveland has lost nearly
                               50 of its street trees from 1940 to today and has
                               retained only 19 of possible canopy coverage
                               each year more than 97 acres of tree canopy is lost
                               and coverage is expected to decline to 14 by 2040

in 2016 the office for a healthy environment and hillcrest hospitals green team
partnered with the western reserve land conservatory to plant 10 trees at two
local mayfield city schools this initiative was spearheaded by cleveland clinic
akron general hospitals president dr brian harte and coo kris bennett the

event was used to promote the many health and environmental benefits of planting trees within our communities

additionally we have started tracking the number of trees planted throughout our enterprise over 2500 trees were
planted during the completion of our avon hospital and in 2016 nearly 460 trees were planted at our main
campus




art  environment a delicate balance

in may 2016 the office for a healthy environment and the arts and
medicine institute hosted a panel discussion and reception to
celebrate the curated exhibition art  environment a delicate
balance the panel consisted of the following local artists and
leaders in sustainability focusing on environmental issues

cleveland clinic the cleveland clinic art program organizes
several exhibitions each year which are seen in this dedicated exhibition area the mission of the art program is to
enrich inspire and enliven our patients visitors employees and community and to embody the core values of the
institution



healthcare climate council

cleveland clinic is a member of health care without harms
climate council the council is open to hospitals and health
systems that recognize climate change is one of the single
largest threats to public health and committed to addressing its
health impacts the councils mission is to amplify public and
private responses to climate change by

  accelerating investment in renewable energy and efficiency

  scaling the healthcare sectors adoption of climate change mitigation and resilience programs and

  advocating for local state and national policies that ensure a sustainable and healthy future


as a leader in healthcare and an anchor institution in our communities cleveland clinic recognizes that and our
response to these challenges will guide the evolution of our organization in the coming decades in 2016 the office

waste reduction
cleveland clinic is committed to reducing waste across our healthcare system by engaging our caregivers to
minimize the waste we send to our landfills we are protecting the environment reducing costs and improving land
air and water quality in our communities we have made significant progress in a number of areas that advanced
our system in responsible waste management



landfill diversion




in 2016 we continued to track over 30 different waste streams in the fourth quarter of 2015 we began to see an
increase in enterprise volume after the acquisition of akron general health system we expect our enterprise
waste and recycling to remain between 7500 and 8000 tons per month

in 2016 our enterprise landfill diversion rate including construction and debris cd was 51 excluding cd it
was 31 the 20 difference was largely due to significant volume from the demolition of one large parking
garage main campus led the enterprise by maintaining over a 45 landfill diversion rate for half of 2016 the
facility has made significant improvements since the office for a healthy environment was established in 2007



zero waste committee

the office for a healthy environment formed an interdepartmental zero
waste committee with the goal of reaching a 50 landfill diversion rate or
more by the end of 2017 our enterprise recycling rate fluctuates between
30 to 40 and to combat stagnation in improvement we conducted waste
audits at several of our hospitals to identify potential opportunities even in
the frigid air of ohio in january passionate caregivers audited the trash of
hillcrest hospital and were able to identify nearly 800 pounds that could be
diverted from the landfill

purple bag expansion




in 2015 we completed a systemwide expansion of our clinical plastics recycling program that was created by
cleveland clinic in partnership with buckeye industries and our waste vendor in 2016 we diverted 124 tons of
materials via this innovative partnership as well as created more than 50 jobs for community members with
developmental disabilities participating facilities competed on a monthly basis to see which team of caregivers
could divert the most clinical plastics from the landfill due to new state guidelines and material economics
buckeye industries is closing down three facilities in 2017 and no longer able to accept our materials we are
working diligently with our waste and supply chain vendors to create a new solution for this recycling stream

see our 2014 ungc report for a detailed program summary



single stream paper shredding  recycling

we offer a single stream paper shreddingrecycling program to our facilities to further protect the personal
information of our patients and to simplify the collection process for our employees all paper regardless of the
sensitivity of the document is collected in our secured shredding containers when this program became
operational in 2010 we observed an increase on the order of 44 in the amount of paper captured in our secure
shredding bins not only does this program improve our hipaa compliance as we shred all paper simplify the
collection process for our employees but it also reduces cost as we have leveraged the value of our paper waste
commodity to negotiate lower service rates this program is now among our lowest cost methods of recycling or
disposal


in 2016 we recycled over 4500 tons of paper which has preserved nearly 77000 trees

single use device reprocessing

in the past when clinical instruments were unused but removed from their packaging presurgery in our ors these
items were incinerated or treated as regulated medical waste in 2011 we adopted a singleuse device program
where these devices are recycled and remade through an indepth and strictly regulated process the reprocessed
items are then sold at a lower cost to healthcare providers the reprocessed equipment is subject to greater
regulations than when it was originally created ensuring the safety of patients and caregivers

in november 2014 cleveland clinic began the conversion process between vendors for our suture and
endomechanical staplers at our main campus we historically purchase around 875 powered staplers annually but
the transition provides the sustainability opportunity to reuse the handle up to 50 times this will cut down our waste
of these large handles from 876 units to almost 18 units a reduction of nearly 98



managing hazardous and regulated wastes

hazardous materials such as sterilization and water treatment chemicals pharmaceuticals cleaning products
electronic wastes laboratory chemicals and radiological films and wastes are an important part of the healthcare
delivery model proper management of these materials is critical to protecting the health of our caregivers and the
community at large

measuring the amount of regulated medical waste that is processed through our two main campus rotoclaves was
challenging until 2016 we had relied on an estimate of average cart weights and the number of loads processed
through the system by our evs team but we still werent confident these numbers were accurate as part of our
enterprise zerowaste and greening the or goals we wanted to be able to quantify the precise amount of rmw
being processed through these machines and trace the waste back to its source in order to identify reduction
opportunities

to accomplish these goals we purchased a large floorscale and with the help of evs developed a carttagging
process to track where each cart was coming from carts are now marked with a sign indicating whether they are
from our ors patient floors or labs after the full cart is transported by a robot through our underground tunnel
system to the dock an evs employee then weighs each cart and enters the weight and tag location into a form on
an ipad this form automatically populates a monthly spreadsheet which we then utilize in our enterprise recycling
data we experience a 99 cart weight accuracy and are now able to understand where our rmw is coming from
this has helped establish accurate metrics to track rmw reductions from the efforts our physician champion matt
davis is implementing in our ors

going green by using blue




our green team recycling sustainability motto is go green by using blue in 2016 our enterprise comingled blue
bag recycling program diverted 2805 tons of cans bottles glass cardboard and poster board from the landfill
the office for a healthy environment works with green teams and the environmental health  safety department
across the enterprise to right size our recycling containers and adjust service frequencies to meet our needs

healthy buildings
our buildings support our mission by addressing the intrinsic link between a persons health and their environment
in this sense our patients environment includes the air they breathe and the water they drink their behaviors
including exercise and nutrition and their values including their choice of healthcare system our buildings must
support the health of our caregivers patients and communities to date we have achieved 15 leed leadership in
energy and environmental design certified buildings  8 silver and 4 gold in 2016 we continued to grow and set
new standards for our buildings and development that support the health of our patients caregivers and
communities



taussig cancer institute

in late 2016 cleveland clinic completed construction on our new
276 million multidisciplinary taussig cancer center that united
all treatment care teams on our main campus in one central
facility and accelerated one of the most robust cancer research
enterprises in the country the new sevenstory facility is part of
cleveland clinics master plan which aims to build a more open
and welcoming campus for patients and visitors as well as
stronger collaboration among staff

the 377000squarefoot facility has been designed to optimize

water stewardship
while clevelands location on lake erie  the 12th largest body of fresh water in the world  provides cleveland
with a distinct comparative advantage the citys reputation has also been blemished by the historic cuyahoga river
ﬁre in 1969 that resulted from excessive levels of pollution caused by heavy manufacturing and industrial
contamination

freshwater resources represent an invaluable local asset that has shaped clevelands identity both in the way that
the city has perceived itself and how it has been recognized outside the region cleveland clinic actively protects
our water supply through conservation measures and stormwater measurement as stewards of our communitys
health we see preservation of our communitys natural resources as a vital part of our health mission



water optimization




in 2016 buildings and properties facilities engineering and the office for a healthy environment formed a water
reduction team with the goal to reduce enterprise water consumption by 10 our team meets monthly to discuss
project status updates and progress from our 2015 baseline we measure progress based on water use intensity or
the demand for water relative to the buildings size

we have 28 different controllers on main campus that run our irrigation system all are equipped with rain sensors
so they do not operate when it rains but twentythree must be manually adjusted and five can be remotely
accessed by a computer the controllers are designed to receive weather information such as expected rainfall
wind speed and temperature so that presets can be determined to meet each areas need for water proper
management of these controls helps reduce unnecessary potable water use for our landscaping



avon bed tower

the expansion of cleveland clinics richard e jacobs family health center was planned with great attention and
care to the natural environment the avon ohio site contains extensive areas of wetlands forests and large
amounts of streams throughout the project planning process we coordinated directly with natural resource and
regulatory agencies including us army corps of engineers ohio environmental protection agency us fish and
wildlife service and ohio department of natural resources to ensure that the hospital expansion was in
compliance with all state and federal laws in place to protect these important resources

the permits received from the state and federal governments authorized impacts to 397 acres of wetlands and
671 feet of stream however these important resources were not lost forever as a condition of receiving the
permits cleveland clinic was required to provide replacement wetlands and streams to compensate for the impacts
resulting from the project to mitigate the loss of wetlands on the site in accordance with state and federal rules we
purchased a total of over 9 acres of wetlands from the nature conservancy and ohio wetlands foundation two
organizations that work to restore wetlands within ohio

cleveland clinic also committed to the extensive use of permeable pavers across the new parking on the property
permeable pavers are an important green infrastructure technology that helps to protect the water quality of our
streams when rain hits permeable pavers it is retained for an extended period of time within the deep gravel sub
base which also serves to filter out contaminants from the storm water before it is released permeable pavers
provide great benefits when compared to traditional asphalt or concrete pavement the use of permeable pavers at
the avon site is the largest of its kind within the greater cleveland area
