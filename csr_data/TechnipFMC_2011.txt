pushing back the limits
of technology to exploit
subsea resources

in the subsea segment technip is involved at every stage of the value chain from
subsea field layout pipeline and umbilical design and fabrication right through to
installation and condition monitoring during production this vertical integration unique
in the sector combined with our project management experience logistics expertise
and leadingedge assets makes technip a global leader in this field


new frontiers
subsea fields are one of the few remaining envi
ronments where oil and gas companies can in
crease production of hydrocarbons but the ma
jority of these new developments lie at extreme
depths or far offshore these hightech projects
thus represent a very significant opportunity for
players like technip which are capable of deliver
ing real added value in the highly competitive
market seen in 2010 technip remained on course
in strategically important regions by securing and
completing major projects

the accident involving the deepwater horizon
drilling platform in the gulf of mexico provided
the energy industry with a sharp reminder that
deep water operations continue to set challenges
that demand the greatest attention to detail in
their execution we believe that this human and
ecological tragedy should result in a preference

used in the mariscal sucre dragon and patao fields
these are the first offshore gas developments in
venezuela the fixed platform will be installed at a
water depth of approximately 130 meters off the
northeast coast of venezuela we also won a major
contract for the kjo project in the middle east see

2010 a watershed
year for onshore
within the context of an overall upturn in the
onshore market in 2010 technip restructured
its onshore activity and reinforced its strategy
to gain new business

the internal organization of our onshore activi

business segment represented within the group
executive committee in the same way as
offshore and subsea in addition to developing
strategy and monitoring business activity the
segment supports the regions in terms of proc

a more balanced backlog investment
to develop our strengths
in 2010 our onshore business continued its focus
on its strategic priorities we thus continued to                                              at the peak of construction up to 70000 people worked

            have to know that heshe is thinking of
            leaving halfway through 2010 we introduced
            a retention system as part of our hrwb
            project this enables managers to alert
            human resources departments when they
            identify any signs of discontent or a change
            of attitude in a key employee losing an
            employee is always a failure this early
            warning system allows us to take action
            before it is too late naturally we also have
            a number of more traditional loyalty
            initiatives to reward results such as

            refinery saudi arabia

            is sustainable development an
            important issue at the project level
            absolutely it is in the context of our projects
            that sustainable development commitments are
            put into practical action for example we are
            very careful to reduce the environmental impact
            of the construction stage by limiting greenhouse
            gas emissions and protecting the natural
            environment

            how can you be certain that the
            standards applied by your sub
            contractors are consistent with
            your own
            firstly by confirming that they share our values
            at the selection stage their practices particularly
            regarding hse are all taken into account when
            selecting them secondly by being absolutely
            clear about what we expect from them in terms
            of sustainable development starting from the
            definition of contract scope on the jubail              technip uses construction subcontractors on its onshore construction sites

           11 accidents were recorded in technip offices during 2010 the majority of them involved falls on stairs which represented onethird of
           all losttime injury accidents recorded for the group that is why an information campaign designed to highlight risky situations was
           launched during the year to encourage employees to take greater care not only of themselves but also of others advice on how taking
           a careful approach can anticipate the risk of falls collisions or the effects of mishandling furniture and equipment was published in our

            what are the key challenges involved
            the major challenge posed by this project aside
            from the extremely tight schedule is the design
            of two different caisson containment systems
            which requires the unique subsea design and
            construction expertise of technip the other
            technical challenge is the chemical dispersant
            fluid system which will be used in cases where it
            is impossible to ensure total well containment
