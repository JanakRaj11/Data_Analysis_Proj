responsible game design
when it comes to games we believe prevention is better than cure  which is why we strive to design games that are lowrisk
for consumers to enjoy we use tools and processes to ensure this and closely monitor games as they are being developed
and launched




whats been happening                                           whats next
we commissioned responsible gambling expert dr                   having improved our responsible game design process
richard woods to complete a review of our endtoend               we will be embedding it across the business
game design process benchmarking our current process            we will be delivering responsible game design training to
identifying key areas of improvement and providing                  relevant teams
recommendations for action                                       we will be building an internal governance team
in the past year we have increased our use of livetesting
games to assess the potential risks presented by new
online games once our existing game design process steps
have been completed
                                                                 100 the percentage of

using multivariant testing mvt we are able to launch a       our risk assessment
game to one cohort of players and exclude another cohort
of players from seeing the game this allows us to closely       tool gamgard
monitor and compare the play and spend behaviour of one
cohort versus the other to see whether playing the new
game has had any adverse impact and if so to immediately
cease the trial




                                                                                                                                7

behavioural analytics and interventions
in order for us to encourage responsible play we need to understand what harm looks like weve worked with a partner
organisation featurespace to define what harm looks like in online play categorised by a basket of indicators this has
allowed us to explore different types of intervention with players who are showing signs of harm the interventions set out
to encourage players to manage their play more responsibly
