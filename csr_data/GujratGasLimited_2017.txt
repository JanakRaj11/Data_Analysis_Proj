                         financial assets measured at amortised cost
                         financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
                      expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to
                         the 12months expected credit losses expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial
                          instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date or
                         full time expected credit losses expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of the

                      revenue receivables under the simplified approach the company is not required to track changes in credit risk rather it
                      recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ecls together with appropriate management estimates for credit loss
                      at each reporting date right from its initial recognition
                      the company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on the portfolio of trade receivables the
                      provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivable and is adjusted
                      for forward looking estimates at every reporting date the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the
                      forwardlooking estimates are analysed
                      ecl impairment loss allowance or reversal recognized during the period is recognized as income expense in the statement of
                      profit and loss this amount is reflected under the head other expenses in the statement of profit and loss the balance sheet

                            fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
                            market participants at the measurement date the fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to
                            sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either
                               in the principal market for the asset or liability or
                               in the absence of a principal market in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
                            the principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the company the fair value of an asset or a liability is
                            measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability assuming that market
                            participants act in their economic best interest
                            the company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to
                            measure fair value maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs
                            all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair
                            value hierarchy described as under based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole

                               level 2  valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or
                                indirectly observable

                                unobservable
                            for assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis the company determines whether
                            transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is
                            significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period
                            the companys management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement such as
                            unquoted financial assets measured at fair value and for nonrecurring measurement such as assets held for distribution in

                            at each reporting date the management analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be
                            remeasured or reassessed as per the companys accounting policies for this analysis the management verifies the major
                            inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation
                            the management in conjunction with the companys external valuers also compares the change in the fair value of each asset
                            and liability with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable
                            for the purpose of fair value disclosures the company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature
                            characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above

                          business the discounted cash flow dcf
                          methodology is used under this approach this
                          methodology works on the premise that the value
                          of a business is measured in terms of future cash
                          flow streams discounted to the present time at an
                          appropriate discount rate this method is used to
                          determine the present value of business on a going
                          concern assumption the dcf technique recognizes
                          the time value of money
                          the value of the firm is arrived at by estimating the
                          free cash flow to firm fcff and discounting the
                          same at the weighted average cost of capital

                      3 cost approach  the cost approach essentially
                          estimates the cost of replacing the tangible assets
                          of the business the replacement cost takes into
                          account the market value of various assets or the
                          expenditure required to create the infrastructure

                      sensitivity analysis
                      profit or loss is sensitive to higherlower interest expense from borrowings as a result of change in interest rates
                      the company does not account for any fixedrate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and the
                      company does not have any designate derivatives interest rate swaps  therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date
                      would not affect profit or loss

                      a reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased decreased equity and
                      profit or loss by the amount shown below

                      i    entitys responsibilities for the governance of the plan
                             risk to the plan
                             following are the risk to which the plan exposes the entity 
                             a actuarial risk
                                 it is the risk that benefits will cost more than expected this can arise due to one of the following reasonsadverse salary
                                 growth experience salary hikes that are higher than the assumed salary escalation will result into an increase in obligation
                                 at a rate that is higher than expected variability in mortality rates if actual mortality rates are higher than assumed mortality
                                 rate assumption than the gratuity benefits will be paid earlier than expected since there is no condition of vesting on the
                                 death benefit the acceleration of cash flow will lead to an actuarial loss or gain depending on the relative values of the
                                 assumed salary growth and discount rate variability in withdrawal rates if actual withdrawal rates are higher than assumed
                                 withdrawal rate assumption than the gratuity benefits will be paid earlier than expected the impact of this will depend on
                                 whether the benefits are vested as at the resignation date
                             b investment risk
                                 for funded plans that rely on insurers for managing the assets the value of assets certified by the insurer may not be the fair
                                 value of instruments backing the liability in such cases the present value of the assets is independent of the future discount
                                 rate this can result in wide fluctuations in the net liability or the funded status if there are significant changes in the discount
                                 rate during the intervaluation period
                             c liquidity risk
                                 employees with high salaries and long durations or those higher in hierarchy accumulate significant level of benefits if some
                                 of such employees resign  retire from the company there can be strain on the cash flows
                             d market risk
                                 market risk is a collective term for risks that are related to the changes and fluctuations of the financial markets one
                                 actuarial assumption that has a material effect is the discount rate the discount rate reflects the time value of money an
                                 increase in discount rate leads to decrease in defined benefit obligation of the plan benefits  vice versa this assumption
                                 depends on the yields on the corporate  government bonds and hence the valuation of liability is exposed to fluctuations in
                                 the yields as at the valuation date
                             e legislative risk
                                 legislative risk is the risk of increase in the plan liabilities or reduction in the plan assets due to change in the legislation 
                                 regulation the government may amend the payment of gratuity act thus requiring the companies to pay higher benefits to
                                 the employees this will directly affect the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the same will have to be
                                 recognized immediately in the year when any such amendment is effective
                      ii   the company has participated in group gratuity scheme plan with life insurance corporation of india lic reliance  hdfc life

                                   notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017

                      footnotes to the above reconciliation are as under
                      1    investment property
                            under ind as land and building held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both rather than for use in production or
                           supply of goods and services or sale in the ordinary course of business are to be classified as investment property under the
                           igaap investment properties were presented as part of freehold land the company has reclassified land valuing rs 130
                           crores as investment property however there is no impact on the total equity or profit as a result of this adjustment
                      2    own your asset scheme oyas
                            under igaap assets given to employees under oyas scheme were reflected as fixed assets and depreciated over their respective
                           useful lives under ind as this has been accounted as a finance lease and the wdv of the underlying assets has been derecognised
                           the difference between the cost of the asset and present value of the consideration received in the future has been recognized as
                           an employee cost over the period the consideration due from the employees over the period has been recognised as receivable
                           consequently an amount of rs 039 crores has been derecognised from ppe on the transition date the total equity of the
                           company reduced by rs 003 crore as on the transition date the impact of reversal of the depreciation and the employee cost are
                           similar to each other for the year ended 31st march 2016 hence there is no significant impact on equity as on 31st march 2016
                      3    fair valuation of investments in mutual funds
                            under igaap the company accounted for short term investments in mutual funds at cost  under ind as the company has
                           designated such investments as fvtpl investments carrying value of investments in mutual fund was rs 93699 crores as
                           per previous gaap on the date of transition consequently the value of total equity on the transition date has increased by rs
                           022 croresnet of tax while the value of investment have increased by rs 034 crores
                      4    interest accrued but not due
                            under igaap the company has invested in fixed deposits with the banks the interest is accrued on the same at each reporting
                           date which is disclosed separately as interest accrued and due separate from the fixed deposit under ind as the fixed deposits
                           are to be reported at amortised cost accordingly interest accrued but not due of rs 124 crores and rs 276 crores as on the
                           transition date and 31st march 2016 respectively has been reclassified to respective fixed deposits there is no impact on the
                           total equity or profit as a result of this adjustment
                      5   interest bearing loans and borrowings
                           under igaap transaction costs incurred in connection with interest bearing loans and borrowings were charged to profit or
                           loss when incurred under ind as transaction costs are included in the initial recognition amount of financial liability and
                           charged to profit or loss using the eir method accordingly the total equity increased by rs 157 crores on the transition date
                           and rs 064 crores on 31st march 2016 the profit for the year ended 31st march 2016 reduced by rs 093 crores as a result
                           of additional interest expense
                      6   proposed dividend and tax thereon
                           under igaap dividends proposed by the board of directors after the balance sheet date but before the approval of the
                           financial statements were considered as adjusting events accordingly provision for proposed dividend was recognised as a
                           liability under ind as such dividends are recognised when the same is approved by the shareholders in the general meeting
                           accordingly the liability proposed dividend of rs 4143 as at 31 march 2016 and rs 8285 as on the transition date included
                           under provisions has been reversed with corresponding adjustment to retained earnings consequently the total equity
                           increased by an equivalent amount
                      7   fvtoci financial assets
                           under igaap the company accounted for long term investments in unquoted and quoted equity shares as investment
                           measured at cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments under ind as the company
                           has designated such investments as fvtoci investments at the transition date  difference between the fair value and igaap
                           carrying amount has been recognised as a separate component of equity net of related deferred taxes this has resulted in a
                           decrease in total equity by rs 3197 crores on 31 march 2016 net of tax
                      8   accounting for excise duty on sale of goods
                           under igaap sale of goods was presented as net of excise duty however under ind as sale of goods includes excise duty
                           which is considered as an expense thus sale of goods for the financial year 201516 under ind as has increased by rs 13990
                           crores with a corresponding increase in other expense this adjustment has no impact on the total equity on the transition date
                           as well as 31 march 2016

                            a contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the
                            occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity

                            be realised however contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits
                            will arise the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs
                            a contingent asset is disclosed by way of notes to financial statements where an inflow of economic benefits is probable

                      sensitivity analysis
                      profit or loss is sensitive to higherlower interest expense from borrowings as a result of change in interest rates
                      the company does not account for any fixedrate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and the
                      company does not have any designate derivatives interest rate swaps  therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date
                      would not affect profit or loss

                      a reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased decreased equity and
                      profit or loss by the amount shown below

                                 at a rate that is higher than expectedvariability in mortality rates if actual mortality rates are higher than assumed mortality
                                 rate assumption than the gratuity benefits will be paid earlier than expected since there is no condition of vesting on the
                                 death benefit the acceleration of cash flow will lead to an actuarial loss or gain depending on the relative values of the
                                 assumed salary growth and discount ratevariability in withdrawal rates if actual withdrawal rates are higher than assumed
                                 withdrawal rate assumption than the gratuity benefits will be paid earlier than expected the impact of this will depend on
                                 whether the benefits are vested as at the resignation date
                             b investment risk
                                 for funded plans that rely on insurers for managing the assets the value of assets certified by the insurer may not be the fair
                                 value of instruments backing the liability in such cases the present value of the assets is independent of the future discount
                                 rate this can result in wide fluctuations in the net liability or the funded status if there are significant changes in the discount
                                 rate during the intervaluation period
                             c liquidity risk
                                 employees with high salaries and long durations or those higher in hierarchy accumulate significant level of benefits if some
                                 of such employees resign  retire from the company there can be strain on the cash flows
                             d market risk
                                 market risk is a collective term for risks that are related to the changes and fluctuations of the financial markets one
                                 actuarial assumption that has a material effect is the discount rate the discount rate reflects the time value of money an
                                 increase in discount rate leads to decrease in defined benefit obligation of the plan benefits  vice versa this assumption
                                 depends on the yields on the corporate  government bonds and hence the valuation of liability is exposed to fluctuations in
                                 the yields as at the valuation date
                             e legislative risk
                                 legislative risk is the risk of increase in the plan liabilities or reduction in the plan assets due to change in the legislation 
                                 regulation the government may amend the payment of gratuity act thus requiring the companies to pay higher benefits to
                                 the employees this will directly affect the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the same will have to be
                                 recognized immediately in the year when any such amendment is effective
