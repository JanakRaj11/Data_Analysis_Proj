have assessed the viability of the group this assessment has been
based upon the groups three year strategic plan theplan and has
taken into account the current position of the group the principal risks
and uncertainties as detailed on pages 22 to 24 above of the strategic
report and the groups prospects

 the groups current balance sheet its strong track record of
   generating operational cash flows and returns to shareholders
   and stress testing of the key trading assumptions within the
   groups plan
 the potential impact of one or more of the principal risks set out on
   pages 22 to 24 occurring in the period on the groups business
   model future trading expectations and liquidity and
 the likely degree and effectiveness of possible mitigating actions in
   relation to the principal risks

the stress testing undertaken included the flexing of a number of key
assumptions within the three year plan namely future revenue growth
including both likeforlike revenues and revenues from the new store
openings gross margins operating costs the impact of interest rates
and working capital management which may be impacted by one or
more of the principal risks to the group a number of challenging but
plausible scenarios which aggregated these individual assumptions

have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three
years to 30 march 2019

during the year grant thornton lux audit sa acted as the groups
auditors and the audit partners responsible were hugues wangen and
carl williams

grant thornton were paid 399k during the year all of which except 9k
was in respect of audit services

in agreeing what nonaudit work can be done by the external auditors
the committee is mindful of the attitude investors now have to the
auditors performing nonaudit services and of the new guidance in this
area which is operative for accounting periods beginning on or after
16th june 2016 going forward the committee will ensure that fees for
nonaudit services do not exceed 70 of aggregate audit fees
measured over a three year period commencing on 27 march 2016

given the decision to appoint new auditors the committee did not
perform a review of the performance of grant thornton in the year

internal audit
the head of internal audit has a direct reporting line to the committee
this was the first full year that the group has had an internal audit
function during the year internal audit undertook a programme of
work which was discussed and agreed with both management and the
committee and which was designed to address both risk management
and areas of potential financial loss internal audit has also established
procedures within the business to ensure that new risks are identified
evaluated and managed and that necessary changes are made to the
risk register

function in relation to
 it systems and processes
 stock management processes and controls
 regulation and compliance including updates on fraud risk
   antimoney laundering and whistleblowing

recommendations for improvement the vast majority of which were
agreed by management and either have been or are being
implemented

the year and concluded that significant progress has been made

strategic plan developed in collaboration with the committee provides
constructive challenge to management and consistently demonstrates
a realistic and commercial view of the business

notes to the consolidated financial statements


1 general information and basis of preparation
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards issued by the
international accounting standards board iasb as adopted by the european union

the groups trade is general retail with trading taking place in the uk and germany the group has been listed on the london stock exchange
since june 2014

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets
and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss the measurement basis and principal accounting policies of the group are set out below
and have been applied consistently throughout the consolidated financial statements

the consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when
otherwise indicated

the consolidated financial statements cover the 52 week period from 29 march 2015 to 26 march 2016 this is a different period to the parent
company stand alone accounts from 1 april 2015 to 31 march 2016

this exception is permitted under article 330 2 of the luxembourg company law of 10th august 1915 as amended as the management believe that

 the consolidated financial statements are more informative when they cover the same period of account as used by the main operating entity
  bm retail ltd and
 that it would be unduly onerous to rephrase the year end in this subsidiary to match that of the parent company

we finally note that the year end for bm retail ltd in any year will not be more than six days prior to the parent company year end

bm european value retail sa is the head of the group and there is no consolidation that takes place above the level of this company

the principal accounting policies of the group are set out below

restatements
at 26 march 2016 the level of imported goods in transit was 582m following a detailed review of the terms and conditions under which these
goods were shipped they have been recognised within inventory at the period end reflecting that the risks and rewards of ownership are
transferred to the group at the point of shipment and not at the uk port as previously concluded

the level of imported goods in transit has increased significantly in recent years and as a consequence of recognising these in inventory at the year
end it has been necessary to revise the recognition of imported goods in transit in previous periods also these changes have no impact on the
statements of comprehensive income or on net equity in the current period or in any of the earlier periods affected the restatements are simply
reclassifications within working capital

in accordance with ias 8 the 2015 statement of financial position has been restated to reclassify payments on account with suppliers to inventories
and to increase trade creditors and inventories to recognise the respective period end positions

the reclassifications result in

 decreases in deposits on account with suppliers of 297m in 2015 and 246m in 2014 including those held by related parties 159m 108m
  respectively
 increases in trade creditors of 175m in 2015 and 85m in 2014
 increases in inventory of 472m in 2015 and 331m in 2014

further information is contained in the relevant notes on inventory 14 receivables 15 payables 17 and related parties 26

reconstruction refinancing and listing of the group
on 19 may 2014 bm european value retail sa the company was incorporated on 17 june 2014 the company acquired the entire issued
share capital of bm european value retail 1 sà rl group the business via a share for share exchange with the shareholders of the business
following the share for share exchange the company became the ultimate legal parent of the group

the share for share transaction is deemed outside the scope of ifrs 3 revised 2008 and as such is not considered a business combination as
prior to the transaction the company was not considered a business under the definition of ifrs 3 appendix a and the application guidance in ifrs
3 b7b12 due to the company being essentially a shell company that had no processes or capability for outputs ifrs 3 b7

the share for share transaction has been accounted for as a group reconstruction following the principles of merger accounting as such comparative
information has been presented on a proforma basis as though the group had been in existence throughout the current and prior periods

     notes to the consolidated financial statements continued


     1 general information and basis of preparation continued
     reconstruction refinancing and listing of the group continued
     accordingly

      the assets and liabilities of the business and its subsidiaries are recognised in the financial information at the precombination carrying
       amounts without restatement to fair value
      the retained losses and other equity balances recognised in the financial information reflect the retained losses and other equity balances of
       the business recorded before the share for share exchange
      the equity structure however reflects the equity structure of the company including those balances which arose due to the equity instruments
       issued under the share for share exchange
      the resulting difference has been recognised as a component of equity being the merger accounting reserve
      because immediately prior to the reconstruction the equity balances in the business were held as debt this debt has remained within the
       restated balance sheet as a liability and has been reclassed upon redemption which occurred as part of the share for share exchange the net
       effect of this is a decrease in the merger reserve on the date of the reconstruction

     immediately after the reconstruction on the same date the group listed on the london stock exchange via an ipo which valued the company at
     27bn and raised 750m cash less 197m of fees which were expensed to profit and loss in the period for the group itself

     as part of this process a refinancing also took place with terms agreed on new banking facilities until june 2019 and june 2020 the refinancing
     incurred 73m of fees which are being amortised over the length of the term 288m of previously unamortised fees relating to the refinancing
     that took place in march 2013 were written off to profit and loss

     overall the key steps in the processes were

     1 bm european value retail sa was incorporated with 9722 million ordinary shares of 10p each

     2 these were exchanged for the preferred equity certificates preference shares and ordinary share capital of bm european value retail 1 sà rl
         the previous group parent

     3 the group reconstruction resulted in the groups share capital preferred equity certificates of 5561m with accrued interest of 878m and
        preference share balances being replaced by the 972m share capital and 25278m of share premium  being the technical valuation of the
        contribution in kind made by the prior owners via their instruments held in bm evr 1 sà rl

     4 this resulted in the recognition of a merger reserve of 19791m

     5 no cash was exchanged as part of the above steps

     6 a further 278million ordinary shares of 10p each were released as part of the ipo these were sold at 270 each leading to the receipt of
        75million and the recognition of 722m of share premium

     basis of consolidation
     the group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings together with the groups
     share of the net assets and results of associated undertakings for the period from 29 march 2015 to 26 march 2016 acquisitions of subsidiaries are
     dealt with by the acquisition method of accounting the results of companies acquired are included in the consolidated statement of
     comprehensive income from the acquisition date

     control is achieved when the group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect
     those returns through its power over the investee

     specifically the group controls an investee if and only if the group has

      power over the investee ie existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee
      exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and
      the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns

     when the group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee the group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in
     assessing whether it has power over an investee including

      the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee
      rights arising from other contractual arrangements and
      the groups voting rights and potential voting rights

     the group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three
     elements of control consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the group loses

                                                                                                                                                             63




control of the subsidiary assets liabilities income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the
statement of comprehensive income from the date the group gains control until the date the group ceases to control the subsidiary excluding the
situations as outlined in the basis of preparation

going concern
viability and going concern statements have been made in the principle risks and uncertainties section of this annual report on the basis of these the
directors have determined that it is appropriate to continue to use the going concern basis for production of these consolidated financial statements

turnover
revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably measured
regardless of when the payment is being made revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable

revenue is the total amount receivable by the group for goods supplied in the ordinary course of business excluding vat and trade discounts
returns and relevant vouchers and offers store retail turnover is recognised at the initial point of sale of goods to customers when the risks and
rewards of the ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer

other administrative expenses
administrative expenses contain all running costs of the business except those relating to inventory which are expensed through cost of sales
tax interest and other comprehensive income

elements which are unusual and significant may be separated onto a separate line item

goodwill
goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition

after initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill
acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to the relevant cashgenerating units cgus that are expected to
benefit from the combination

goodwill is tested for impairment at each year end and at any time where there is any indication that goodwill may be impaired internally
generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset

segment reporting
operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker the chief
operating decision maker has been identified as the executive directors of the group the board is responsible for assessing the performance of
the business for the purpose of making decisions about resources to be allocated

business combinations
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method the cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the
consideration transferred measured at the acquisition date fair value acquisitionrelated costs are expensed depending on their nature with
costs of raising finance amortised over the term of the relevant element of finance provided and the remainder expensed when incurred

after initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill
acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the groups cashgenerating units or group of cash
generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned
to those units

brands
brands acquired as part of a business combination are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently reviewed at least annually for
impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable where the carrying value
of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount ie the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell the asset is written down accordingly
and charged to administration expenses

brands are considered to have an indefinite life on the basis that they form part of the cash generating units within the company which will
continue in operation indefinitely with no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inflows

     notes to the consolidated financial statements continued


     1 general information and basis of preparation continued
     intangible assets
     intangible assets acquired separately including computer software are measured on initial recognition at cost comprising the purchase price and
     any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for use

     following initial recognition assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses amortisation begins
     when an asset is available for use and is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows

     computer software acquired           4 years

     property plant and equipment
     property plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses

     cost comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs unless significant or incurred as part of a refit programme subsequent expenditure
     will usually be treated as repairs or maintenance and expensed to profit and loss

     subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that
     future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably the carrying amount of
     the replaced part is derecognised

     freehold land is not depreciated for all other property plant and equipment depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost
     less residual value of the assets over their estimated useful lives as follows

     depreciation
     depreciation is provided on all other items of property plant and equipment and the effect is to write off the carrying value of items by equal
     instalments over their expected useful economic lives it is applied at the following rates

     leasehold buildings                  life of lease
     freehold buildings                   2  4 straight line
     plant fixtures and equipment        10  25 straight line
     fixtures fittings and vehicles      20  25 straight line

     residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted prospectively if appropriate

     an item of property plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or
     disposal any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying
     amount of the asset is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognised

     investments in associates
     associates are those entities over which the group has significant influence but which are neither subsidiaries nor interests in joint ventures
     investments in associates are recognised initially at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity method however any goodwill or fair
     value adjustment attributable to the share in the associate is included in the amount recognised as investment in associates

     all subsequent changes to the share of interest in the equity of the associate are recognised in the groups carrying amount of the investment
     changes resulting from the profit or loss generated by the associate are reported in share of profits of associates in the consolidated income
     statement and therefore affect net results of the group these changes include subsequent depreciation amortisation and impairment of the fair
     value adjustments of assets and liabilities

     items that have been recognised directly in the associates other comprehensive income are recognised in the consolidated other comprehensive
     income of the group however when the groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate including any
     unsecured receivables the group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the
     associate if the associate subsequently reports profits the investor resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits
     equals the share of losses not recognised

     unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the associates
     unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred amounts reported in the
     consolidated financial statements of associates have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted
     by the group

                                                                                                                                                            65




impairment of nonfinancial assets
the group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired if any indication exists or when annual
impairment testing for an asset is required for goodwill or indefinite life assets the group estimates the assets recoverable amount

indications of impairment might include for goodwill and the brand assets for instance a significant impairment to the like for like sales of
established stores sustained negative publicity or a drop off in visits to our website and social media accounts

an assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cgus fair value less costs to sell and its value in use it is determined for an individual
asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets where the carrying
amount of an asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount

in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cgu

the group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the groups cgus to
which the individual assets are allocated these budgets and forecast calculations cover a period of five years for longer periods a longterm
growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year

impairment losses of continuing operations including impairment on inventories are recognised in the income statement in those expense
categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset

for assets excluding goodwill and acquired brands with indefinite lives an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any
indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased if such indication exists the group estimates
the assets or cgus recoverable amount

a previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised the reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable
amount nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation had no impairment loss been recognised for the
asset in prior years such reversal is recognised in the income statement except for impairment of goodwill which is not reversed

leases
the determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date the
arrangement is assessed for whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement
conveys a right to use the asset or assets even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement

the economic ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee if the lessee bears substantially all the risks and rewards related to the
ownership of the leased asset the related asset is recognised at the time of inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or if lower
the present value of the minimum lease payments plus incidental payments if any to be borne by the lessee a corresponding amount is
recognised as a finance leasing liability

the interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to profit and loss
over the period of the lease

a leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset however if there is no reasonable certainty that the group will obtain ownership by
the end of the lease term the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term

all other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on
a straight line basis over the lease term lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease

onerous leases
the group carries a property provision which is recognised on specific sites within the groups leasehold property portfolio where an exit can be
reasonably expected to occur and a lease is considered onerous

a lease is considered onerous when the economic benefits of occupying the leased properties are less than the obligations payable under the lease

the amount held covers any costs expected to accrue before the end of the contract netted against any income as well as a portion related to any
dilapidation expense which may arise

inventories
inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items net
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs to sell

     notes to the consolidated financial statements continued


     1 general information and basis of preparation continued
     share options
     the group operates share option schemes with the first such scheme commencing in august 2014

     the schemes have been accounted for under the provisions of ifrs 2 and accordingly have been fair valued on their inception date using
     appropriate methodology the black scholes and monte carlo models

     a cost is recorded through profit and loss in respect of the number of options outstanding and the fair value of those options a corresponding
     credit is made to the retained earnings reserve and the effect of this can be seen in the statement of changes in equity

     taxation
     current income tax
     current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation
     authorities the tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in
     the countries where the group operates and generates taxable income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it
     relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive
     income or directly in equity respectively

     deferred tax
     deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying
     amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except

      when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business
       combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss
      in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries associates and interests in joint ventures when the
       timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the
       foreseeable future

     deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the
     extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused
     tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except

      when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
       transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss
      in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries associates and interests in joint ventures deferred
       tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable
       profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised

     the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
     taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at
     each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to
     be recovered

     deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is
     settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date

     financial assets
     initial recognition and measurement
     the classification of financial instruments is determined at initial recognition the group has the following types of financial assets trade and other
     receivables and cash which are classified within the ias 39 definition of loans and receivables and derivative contracts which are classified within
     the ias 39 definition of fair value through profit and loss all financial assets are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual
     provisions of the instrument all financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs other than for financial assets carried at
     fair value through profit or loss

     the group does not have any heldtomaturity or availableforsale financial assets

     subsequent measurement
     the subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described below

     loans and receivables
     loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market after initial
     measurement such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method eir less impairment
     amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir
     the eir amortisation and the losses arising from impairment are recognised in profit and loss

                                                                                                                                                                    67




financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include derivative financial instruments entered into by the group that are not designated as
hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by ias 39 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of
financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss

derecognition
a financial asset or where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised when the rights to
receive cash flows from the asset have expired and the entity has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full and either a the entity has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or b the
entity has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the asset

impairment of financial assets
the group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired
a financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more
events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future
cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated

financial liabilities
initial recognition and measurement
financial liabilities within the scope of ias 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities the

     the group companies whose functional currency is the euro have been consolidated into the group via retranslation of their accounts in line with
     ias 21 effects of changes in foreign exchange rates the assets and liabilities are translated into pounds sterling at the year end exchange rate
     the revenues and expenses are translated into pounds sterling at the average monthly exchange rate during the period any resulting foreign
     exchange difference is cumulatively recorded in the foreign exchange reserve with the annual effect being chargedcredited to other
     comprehensive income

     transactions entered into by the company in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates the
     functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated
     at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are
     recognised immediately in profit or loss

     pension costs
     the group operates a defined contribution scheme and contributions are charged to profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred

     provisions
     provisions are recognised when a present obligation legal or constructive exists as a result of a past event and where it is probable that an
     outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated provisions
     are discounted where the time value of money is considered to be material

     critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
     the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of
     causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are described below the group
     based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial information was prepared existing circumstances and
     assumptions about future developments however may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the group
     such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur

     impairment of nonfinancial assets
     impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of its fair value
     less costs to sell and its value in use

     the fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions conducted at arms length for similar assets
     or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset the value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow
     model the cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the group is not yet
     committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the performance of the cgu being tested

     the recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows
     and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cgus
     including a sensitivity analysis are disclosed and further explained in note 12

                                                                                                                                                                69




investments in associates
multilines international company ltd multilines which is 50 owned by the group has been considered by management to be an associate
rather than a subsidiary or a joint venture under ifrs 10 control is determined by

 power over the investee
 exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
 the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investors returns

although 50 owned
 multilines have their own independent management who operate without direct oversight of bm group management on a day to day basis
 bm group does not have the right to appoint directors nor do we have a casting vote

therefore the level of power over the business is considered to be more in keeping with that of an associate than a jointventure and hence it has
been treated as such within these consolidated financial statements

putcall options on jawoll noncontrolling interest
the purchase agreement for jawoll included call and put options over the shares not purchased by the group representing 20 of jawoll the
options are arranged such that it is considered likely that either the call or put option will be taken at the exercise date in 2019

the exercise price of the options contain a variable element and as such the risk and rewards of the options are considered to remain with the
noncontrolling interest the purchase of the noncontrolling interest will be recognised upon exercise of one of the options

a financial liability has been recognised carried at amortised cost to represent the expected exercise price with the corresponding debit entry to
the putcall option reserve management have estimated the future measurement inputs in arriving at this value using knowledge of current
performance expected growth and planned strategy any subsequent movements in the liability will be recognised in profit or loss

standards and interpretations applied and not yet applied by the group
new and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the group
ifric 21 levies sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy if that liability is within the scope of ias 37 provisions the interpretation
addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when a liability should be recognised the adoption of ifric 21 does not
have a significant impact for the group

disclosure initiative amendments to ias 1  applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2016 to encourage companies to
apply professional judgement in determining the information to disclose in their financial statements

amendments to ias 16 property plant and equipment and ias 38 intangible assets on depreciation and amortisation  effective from
1 january 2016 iasb has clarified that the use of revenuebased methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate because
revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits
embodied in the asset the iasb has also clarified that revenue is generally presumed to be an inappropriate basis for measuring the
consumption of the economic benefits embodied in an intangible asset however past the headline is a rebuttable presumption and
revenuebased amortisation is permitted when it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of the economic benefits of the
intangible asset are highly correlated

10 earnings per share
basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the financial period attributable to ordinary equity holders of
the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding at each period end

as the group undertook a group reconstruction in june 2014 the number of shares in the prior period has been adjusted to match the
postrestructuring position such that the figures remain comparable

diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during each year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on
conversion of any dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares

adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated on the same basis except using the adjusted profit or loss attributable to the equity
holders of the parent

there are share option schemes in place which has a dilutive effect on both periods presented

the following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations

impairment review of goodwill and brand assets
during the year management have reviewed the impairment test methodology and the following changes have been made

 before applying the perpetuity they now use a five year forecast rather than a ten year forecast in order to have a more accurate forecast over
  this shorter period
 to more accurately reflect the cashflows received they now use a midyear discount factor instead of a year end discount factor

the prior year sensitivities included below have been restated on this basis and show that the changes made have no material impact on the
calculation of the recoverable amount and there remains no requirement to impair the goodwill or brand assets

assets arising upon the acquisition of bm european value retail 2 sà rl sbr europe
a goodwill asset of 807496k and a brand asset of 93700k arose as a result of the business combination undertaken as at 6 march 2013 the
acquisition of bm european value retail 2 sà rl by the group

the brand intangible asset was identified with indefinite life this was the only identifiable intangible asset recognised that was considered to be
likely to have a value above a set materiality threshold the indefinite life was considered appropriate because of several factors chief amongst
which was that the growth potential of the bm business was considered by management to be a longterm phenomenon

the goodwill and brand have been allocated to two groups of cash generating units cgus being the two fascias that the group operates within
its retail segment bargain stores and home stores

the allocation split is as follows
                                                                                                                   bargain stores   home stores        total

     these assumptions are held for five years in the forecast and then a perpetuity is performed over the year five figures effectively assuming no
     further like for like growth or inflation after that point

     in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the assumptions it was calculated that a cgu would first require impairment if all other assumptions
     being held equal
     i the groups cost of capital was 238 2015 265
     ii the inflation rate was 331 2015 146
     iii the like for like sales suffered a contraction of 98 2015 76 per annum

     the interest rate used in calculating the groups cost of capital as used in the impairment test has been determined to be a reasonable rate to use
     in terms of the rates prevalent in the market at the date of the impairment test

     assets arising upon the acquisition of ja woll handels gmbh and their subsidiaries jawoll
     a goodwill asset of 37952k and brand assets of 5950k arose as a result of the business combination undertaken as at 30 april 2014 the
     acquisition of ja woll handels gmbh and their subsidiaries jawoll by the group see note 28

     at the acquisition date this was translated to 31258k for the goodwill and 4901k for the brand assets however as the functional currency of
     jawoll is the euro all impairment calculations have been calculated in euros and therefore it is that currency we shall refer to in the
     following discussion

     the brand intangible assets were recognised as having indefinite life and were the only identifiable intangible assets recognised that were
     considered to be likely to have a value above a set materiality threshold the indefinite life was considered appropriate because of several factors
     chief amongst which was that the growth potential of the jawoll business was considered by management to be a longterm phenomenon

     the goodwill and brand have been allocated to two groups of cash generating units cgus being the two fascias that the group operates within
     its retail segment jawoll and hafu in the following proportions
                                                                                                                          jawoll         hafu         total

the group has performed impairment tests as at the period end dates and at the acquisition date which was during the prior year the
impairment test involves assessing the net present value npv of the expected cash flows in relation to the stores within each cgu according to a
number of assumptions more detail on which follows below to calculate the value in use viu for the group of cgus the results of the
impairment tests identified that each viu was significantly in excess of the carrying value of assets within each cgu at the period end dates and
date of initial recognition no other indicators of impairment were noted

the key assumptions used were
i the groups cost of capital is as per above
ii the inflation rate which has been based upon the consumer price index for germany
iii the like for like sales growth within each shop a prudent estimate made by management

the values for the assumptions used were 
                                                                                                                   26 march      28 march       30 april

these assumptions are held for five years in the forecast and then a perpetuity is performed over the year five figures effectively assuming no
further like for like growth or inflation after that point

in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the assumptions it was calculated that an impairment would first require impairment if all other
assumptions being held equal
i the groups cost of capital was 853 2015 390 2014 313
ii the inflation rate was 198 2015 53 2014 53
iii the like for like sales suffered a contraction of 123 2015 22 2014 08

the interest rate used in calculating the groups cost of capital as used in the impairment test has been determined to be a reasonable rate to use
in terms of the rates prevalent in the market at the date of the impairment test

     on the acquisition of the sbr europe group on 6 march 2013 the property plant and equipment was restated such that their net book value
     equalled their cost initially an estimation technique was used to perform this task due to the number of assets on the fixed asset register but the
     value was calculated exactly before the 28 march 2015 year end the resulting differences in cost and accumulated depreciation which have no
     impact on net book value have been included in the adjustment line related to the prior year

     notes to the consolidated financial statements continued


     25 financial risk management
     the group uses various financial instruments including bank loans related party loans finance company loans cash equity investment
     derivatives and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations

     the main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are market risk currency risk cash flow interest rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk
     the directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below

     the existence of these financial instruments exposes the group to a number of financial risks which are described in more detail below in order to
     manage the groups exposure to those risks in particular the groups exposure to currency risk the group enters into forward foreign currency
     contracts no transactions in derivatives are undertaken of a speculative nature the group does not apply hedge accounting as outlined under
     ias 39

     market risk
     market risk encompasses three types of risk being currency risk fair value interest rate risk and commodity price risk commodity price risk is not
     considered material to the business as the group is able to pass on pricing changes to its customers

     despite the impact of price risk not being considered material the group engages in a swap contract over the cost of fuel in order to minimise the
     impact of any volatility

     the sensitivity to these contracts for a reasonable change in the year end fuel price is as follows
                                                                                                                                          26 march      28 march
                                                                                                                            change in         2016          2015
     as at                                                                                                                   fuel price      000         000

     effect on profit before tax                                                                                                5            64            52
                                                                                                                                5           64          50


     this has been calculated by taking the spot price of fuel at the year end applying the change indicated in the table and projecting this over the life
     of the contract assuming all other variables remain equal

     the groups policies for managing fair value interest rate risk are considered along with those for managing cash flow interest rate risk and are set
     out in the subsection entitled interest rate risk below

     currency risk
     the group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk arising from exchange rate fluctuation on its purchases from
     overseas suppliers

     in relation to translation risk this is not considered material to the business as amounts owed in foreign currency are short term of up to 30 days
     and are of a relatively modest nature transaction exposures including those associated with forecast transactions are hedged when known
     principally using forward currency contracts whilst the aim is to achieve an economic hedge the group does not adopt an accounting policy of
     hedge accounting for this financial information

     all of the groups sales are to customers in the uk and germany and there is no currency exposure in this respect a proportion of the groups
     purchases are priced in us dollars and the group generally uses forward currency contracts to minimise the risk associated with that exposure

     foreign currency sensitivity
     the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in us dollar period end exchange rates with all other variables
     held constant

     the impact on the groups profit before tax is largely due to changes in the fair value of the fx options

these calculations have been performed by taking the year end translation rate used on the accounts and applying the change noted above the
balance sheet valuations are then directly calculated the valuation of the foreign exchange derivatives are projected based upon the spot rate
changing and all other variables being held equal

interest rate risk
interest rate risk is the risk of variability of the group cash flows due to changes in the interest rate the group is exposed to changes in interest
rates as all of the groups bank borrowings are subject to a floating rate based on libor

the groups interest rate risk arises mainly from longterm borrowings borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest
rate risk the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not considered to be material however the group uses interest rate swaps to
minimise the impact

at year end if libor interest rates had been 50 basis points higherlower with all other variables held constant the effect upon calculated pretax
profit for the year would have been
                                                                                                                     basis point    26 march     28 march

this sensitivity has been calculated by changing the interest rate for each interest payment and accrual made by the group over the period by the
amount specified in the table above and then calculating the difference that would have been required

it also includes the effect on the year end valuation of the interest rate swap contract where the percentage change in libor indicated above has
been applied to the year end spot rate and this has then been projected over the remaining life of the contracts with the assumption that all other
variables are held equal

credit risk
credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract leading to a financial loss
the groups principal financial assets are cash and trade receivables the credit risk associated with cash is limited as the main counterparty is a
uk clearing bank with a high credit rating a long term and a1 short term standard  poor unchanged from the prior year the principal credit
risk arises therefore from the groups trade receivables

credit risk is further limited by the fact that the vast majority of sales transactions are made through the store registers direct from the customer at
the point of purchase leading to a low trade receivables balance

in order to manage credit risk the directors set limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references
credit limits are reviewed by the credit controller on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history provisions against bad
debts are made where appropriate

none of the receivables recognised were considered irrecoverable at the acquisition date

fees of 827k were incurred during the acquisition these were expensed through the profit and loss in the prior period

included in the creditors balance is a liability of 57m relating to a profit  loss transfer agreement plta as part of the acquisition jawoll group
performed a necessary reorganisation in order to separate the businesses to be acquired and those not to be acquired this resulted in a profit 
loss transfer agreement claim which jawoll agreed to meet on behalf of those subsidiaries to which it applied

this was therefore expensed on the preacquisition profit  loss account but at the date of the acquisition the liability had not been settled this
resulted in the liability being present on the acquisition balance sheet as well as a higher than usual cash balance

the liability was settled shortly after acquisition and appears within the prior year cashflow statement at a different value due to being translated
at the period average rate instead of the acquisition date rate at which it is included above

the goodwill largely relates to the growth potential of the business with smaller elements representing the workforce and current location of the
stores none of the elements which make up goodwill can or are not material enough to be recognised as a separate intangible asset

the effect the acquisition has had on the pl can be seen in the segmental note note 2 as the germany retail segment comprises the whole of
jawoll had the company been bought at the start of the year it would have contributed an estimated extra 144m to revenue and 21m to
operating profit figures under german gaap

29 capital management
for the purpose of the groups capital management capital includes issued capital and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders
of the parent the primary objective of the groups capital management is to maximise the shareholder value

in order to achieve this overall objective the groups capital management amongst other things aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants
attached to the interestbearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements breaches in meeting the financial covenants
would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings there have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any interestbearing
loans and borrowing in the current or prior period

the group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of the
financial covenants

to maintain or adjust the capital structure the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders return capital to shareholders or issue
new shares

the group uses the following definition of net debt

external interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and shortterm deposits

the interest bearing loans figure used is the gross amount of cash borrowed at that time as opposed to the carrying value under the amortised
cost method

      note 2  summary of significant accounting policies
      basis of preparation
      these annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with luxembourg legal and regulatory requirements under the historical cost
      convention accounting policies and valuation rules are besides the ones laid down by the law of december 19 2002 as amended by the law of
      december 10 2010 and july 30 2013 the law determined and applied by the directors of the company the board of directors

      the preparation of annual accounts requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates it also requires management to exercise its
      judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies changes in assumptions may have a significant impact on the annual accounts in
      the period in which the assumptions changed management believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and that the annual
      accounts therefore present the financial position and results fairly

      the company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year estimates and
      judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are
      believed to be reasonable under the circumstances

      significant accounting policies
      the main valuation rules applied by the company are the following

      foreign currency translation
      the company maintains its accounting records in pounds sterling gbp and the balance sheet and the profit and loss accounts are expressed in
      this currency

      transactions expressed in currencies other than gbp are translated into gbp at the exchange rate effective at the time of the transaction

      long term nonmonetary assets expressed in currencies other than gbp are translated into gbp at the exchange rate effective at the time of the
      transaction at the balance sheet date these assets remain converted using the exchange rate at the time of the transaction the historical
      exchange rate

      cash at bank is translated at the exchange rate effective at the balance sheet date exchange losses and gains are recorded in the profit and loss
      account of the year

      in accordance with prudence principles found within generally accepted accounting principles in luxembourg luxgaap other assets are
      translated separately at the lower of the value converted using the historical exchange rate and the value converted using the exchange rate at
      the balance sheet date conversely other liabilities are translated separately at the higher of the value converted using the historical exchange
      rate and the exchange rate at the balance sheet date consequently both realised and unrealised exchange losses are recorded in the profit and
      loss account while exchange gains are recorded in the profit and loss account when realised only

      where there is an economic link between an asset and a liability these are valued in total according to the method described above and the net
      unrealised losses are recorded in the profit and loss account while the net unrealised gains are not recognised

      shares in affiliated holdings are valued at purchase price including the expenses incidental thereto in the case of durable depreciation in value
      according to the opinion of the board of directors value adjustments are made in respect of financial fixed assets so that they are valued at the
      lower figure to be attributed to them at the balance sheet date these value adjustments are not continued if the reasons for which the value
      adjustments were made have ceased to apply

                                                                                                                                                                    103
