motivation and satisfaction
the employees are one of the strategic pillars of bcp group for this reason it is essential for the banks
dynamics and sustainability to use an annual survey to check the levels of i global satisfaction ii
satisfaction with the organic unit iii satisfaction with the direct manager and iv motivation

registering a slight fall in the global participation less 3 ip index points compared with 2012 the survey
taken in the beginning of 2013 recorded a participation of 81 of the employees the decrease resulted
from a smaller participation in portugal poland and romania the results attained in global satisfaction 
717 ip  a decrease that although not significant was mainly the result of the figures from romania and
mozambique in portugal the figures remained aligned with those of previous years satisfaction with the
organic unit did not show any significant deviation presenting a global value of 764 ip satisfaction with
the direct manager 787 ip increased slightly 1 ip influenced by the majority of the operations
motivation was the indicator that showed the most significant increase reaching the highest value of the
last years 733 ip this value was particularly influenced by the employees in portugal who showed a
level of motivation of 80 ip a result that if seen within the current economic and social context of the
country and of the bank is particularly significant

environmental responsibility
bcp group aware of its environmental impacts continued its effort to minimise its ecological footprint by
promoting the best practices in reducing electricity use greenhouse gas emissions and consumption of
natural resources



 in portugal within environmental commitment millennium bcp defined goals for reducing ecological
 footprint for 2014 3 for paper and cardboard 4 for water consumption 11 for electricity
 consumption and 3 for co2 emissions

based on a continuous improvement rationale the bank is the path to eco efficiency and investing in two
large areas

 optimisation of processes and equipments  investments to improve the banks processes and its
equipment and infrastructure

 environmental awareness  involving employees and customers in the adoption of more responsible
environmental practices

optimisation of processes and equipments
to produce more and better with less millennium invests in the continuous optimisation of its processes
and activities and in the renewal of its equipment and infrastructure all actions are carried out based on
rigorous costbenefit analysis and have as fundamental premise maintaining the quality of the service
provided and increasing the satisfaction of the banks customers by investing a large part of resources
available to minimise environmental impacts optimising processes and improving equipments and infra
structures the bank saves water materials and energy and subsequently has less greenhouse gas
emissions

portugal
in portugal in 2013 and similarly to the work being carried out in previous years several measures were
put in place to reduce the banks electricity use and increase energy efficiency achieving significant
average monthly reductions of consumption

all energy efficiency measures in place allowed estimated savings of around 2600 mwh corresponding to
  implemented measures                                                                   monthly reduction

  adjustment of the schedules of functioning of the interior illumination of the buildings
                                                                                                3875 kwh

  recovery of heat in the three main units of air

an estimated reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 778 tco2eq

at tagus park and at 53 branches the bank started a diagnosis which will take place over 24 months of
energy consumption of the infrastructure and heating ventilation and air conditioning systems hvac
aiming to manage them more efficiently and reduce consumption

as part of the efforts to reduce energy consumption the policies in place regarding employee travel as a
result of budget restraints resulted in video and audio conferences becoming an everyday practice for
bank employees registering an expressive increase 161 in the number of employees who participated

                                                                           2013 sustainability report   40




in webex sessions rising from 4905 participants in 2012 to 12794 in 2013 the collective transportation
of employees to tagus park by bus registered a 2 increase in demand in terms of average daily
number of passengers

in 2013 the bank continued to strive to use less paper with 53 of statements being sent by email a
12 increase compared with 2012 the bank also recorded an increase in online bank slips which now
represent 91 of all bank slips issued in the large majority of documents issued both for customers and
employees and internal administrative processes statements bank slips salary receipts account opening
and mortgage loans documents there was a clear preference for digital documentation with around 84
of documents being issued in soft copy



programme ser lean do being lean od operations division

in 2013 millennium bcp strengthened the continuous improvement programme for procedures being
lean od created in 2010 for the purpose of promoting operational excellence optimising processes
this helped spread a culture of continuous improvement lean amongst the banks employees
through an it application to support the management of the continuous improvement and of the work
methods based on mapping procedures work standardisation root cause analysis and visual
management the programme was able to identify around 1400 opportunities to improve the quality of the
procedures andor decrease related costs presently the being lean od programme involves around 800
employees and in 2013 it was broadened to include the financial operations department and the human
resources division
in 2014 the lean academy was created with the goal of applying the lean methodology to other banks
divisions and to ensure the necessary support in the teams where this approach has already been
implemented the academy consists of a team of permanent support and various implementation teams
which will promote the optimization of processes in the areas ensuring a strong support to the lean
agents employees who have the role of agents of change in the dissemination of the lean spirit and in
the implementation of sustainability tools
globally the being lean od programme led to an estimated decrease of 16 million paper sheets in 2013
                         2
and helped release 130 m of physical space




poland
bank millennium continued its effort to reduce energy consumption and minimise greenhouse gas
emissions accomplishing several actions and good practices namely

 the continuous monitoring of energy consumption in branches continued through invoice control
creating a ranking of branches according to energy consumption whenever possible and economically
viable the bank applies the improvement recommendations issued by energy audits

 within the scope of it equipment besides replacing older computers for new ones with 33 less energy
consumption the bank continued to invest in the verdiem project and in the computer cloud programme
both launched in poland in 2012 project verdiem through the technological installation that enables the
centralised management of it equipment placing them on standby and offmode in periods when they
are not being used enabled a global decrease of energy consumption of around 40 the computer
cloud which consists in making the banks data centres virtual enables savings of up to 20 in the
energy consumption of these devices

 regarding the vehicle fleet and following the programme for replacing older cars for new cars meeting
the euro 5 regulation burning less fuel and with lower co2 emissions in 2013 the bank was able to have
78 of its cars meet the euro 5 regulation

in terms of water management and similarly to what is being done in terms of electricity millennium bank
continuously monitors the water consumption of the branches by controlling invoices the branches are
ranked according to consumption and those that have higher consumption are audited whenever possible
and economically viable the bank applies the improvement recommendations resulting from the audits

the decrease in the use of materials especially paper translated into several actions namely

41 2013   sustainability report




 creation of the 8 in 1 contract for a package of basic products for new customers with this contract a
new customer who purchases several services with the bank receives only one contract instead of one
per product thus reducing the consumption of paper ink and toner cartridges

 control in a more detailed manner of the distribution of materials for advertising campaigns within the
scope of the quantities required and necessary for the purpose of decreasing the costs of these
campaigns as well as paper consumption

in poland the bank also aimed to decrease of paper and plastic use through a mechanism for controlling
the purchase of materials in place since 2012

other countries
in all the other countries where millennium operates though less representative in terms of size and
consequently in terms of environmental impacts due to energy and natural resources consumption there
are also concerns that are common to all such as energy consumption paper consumption employee
travel

romania is shrinking its car fleet and decreasing the number of trips employees make the bank also
established practices to reduce materials consumption such as reusing cardboard boxes and the
existence of specific software in printers to prevent the occurrence of undesired printing

millennium bim in mozambique undertook efforts to cut down on hard copies sending about 65 of
statements to customers by email

in angola branches were fitted with timers that shut down the main energyguzzling equipment in non
working hours thus contributing to save energy and costs

environmental awareness
the employees environmental awareness has been considered by millennium as strategic in decreasing
the banks environmental impacts

portugal
in portugal employee awareness was raised to the importance of adopting a more responsible
environmental attitude through the continuous communication programme green it in place since 2010
with the goal of decreasing the banks main consumptions with environmental impact and simultaneously
reducing costs in 2013 as part of the communication plan highlight also include in addition to the regular
disclosure of environmental information to raise the employees awareness on the website and in all the
newsletters its our news the production and disclosure of the green it newsletter  we all can make a
difference focusing the importance of the employees in the effort to cut down energy and resources
consumption the programme consumption dashboard continued to be applied enabling the control of
the number of printouts made in all the banks divisions and a campaign was launched on the it portal to
cut down 20 of the prints in the it division achieving a 28 decrease

poland
in poland bank millennium took part for the fourth consecutive year in the world wide initiative earth
hour shutting down advertising signs in branches and in buildings for one hour as a signal to the general
community on the impacts caused by mans actions the equitrac programme created in 2012 to control
and report on the number of printouts ordered by the employees continued to raise awareness to the
importance of decreasing paper usage



customer awareness
in 2013 bank millennium launched an advertising campaign in the social media to promote customer
investment in energy efficiency projects as part of the polseff programme the programme managed by
the european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd was created for the purpose of
supporting projects that promote energy efficiency

                                                                                                          2013 sustainability report               42




environmental manual for customers and employees
an environmental manual was launched to raise customer and employee awareness for the importance of
decreasing the main environmental impacts of resources consumption encompassing issues such as
recycling electronic devices as well as the responsible use of resources such as water energy and raw
materials the manual is a practical tool to cut back on environmental impacts

ecological footprint
millennium regularly monitors a set of environmental performance indicators that measure the level of eco
efficiency of the bank against the main resources consumption with environmental impact namely
water energy greenhouse gas emissions and materials

in 2013 the main environmental impact consumption when analyzed in total reduced reflecting the
continuous banks effort to improve their ecoefficiency however when we analyze the environmental
performance indicators expressing the banks consumption per employee there is a slight increase in
energy consumption in materials and in greenhouse gas emissions this increase is due to the overall
reduction of the number of employees of the millennium bcp between 2012 and 2013

                                                                                                    1

43 2013    sustainability report




the consumption of indirect energy went down 9 compared with 2012 this significant decrease in
indirect energy consumption occurred mainly due to the 11 decrease verified in portugal in the
consumption of electricity caused by the energy efficiency measures in place and by closing 70 branches
and two back office buildings poland and romania also contributed to decreasing indirect energy use in
the bank due to the decrease of electricity consumption by 2 and 20 respectively compared with
2012 globally the bank decreased electricity consumption by 11

in portugal the cogeneration central in tagus park decreased its energy production by 6 compared
with 2012 producing 16 of all the electricity used in portugal

millenniums direct energy consumption corresponds to the energy the bank consumes through the fossil
fuels purchased namely diesel gasoline and natural gas the banks consumption of direct energy
dropped 2 due to the 8 decrease in energy consumption in portugal total direct energy use in
portugal represents around 57 of total consumption of this type of energy in the bank the decrease
registered in portugal was caused by the decrease in consumption of all fossil fuels especially natural gas
with a 4 decrease the reductions registered in portugal in the consumption of direct energy are justified
by the decrease in the number of branches and back office buildings and by the decrease in the vehicle
fleet especially cars with gasoline engines also contributing to the reduction of the banks direct energy
consumption was the 6 reduction verified in angola in the diesel consumption for equipment which
represents 21 of all direct energy consumed by millennium the high diesel consumption for equipment
in angola results from the necessity to produce electric energy through generators due to the interruptions
of the supply on the part of the public grid

greenhouse gas emissions
as part of the effort to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change millennium
computes and monitors its carbon footprint and takes part every year in the carbon disclosure project
cdp having already participated five times

the banks carbon footprint follows the decreasing trend recorded for the consumption of direct and
indirect energy with total greenhouse gas emissions down 6 compared with 2012

 scope 1 emissions result from the use of fossil fuels namely gasoline diesel and natural gas direct
energy and leaks from hvac equipment scope 1 emissions contributed 30 of all emissions from
millennium 24681tco2eq 2 less than in 2012 reflecting the 2 decrease recorded in the
consumption of direct energy

 scope 2 emissions totalling 55691tco2eq represent 69 of millenniums greenhouse gas emissions
mainly caused by the consumption of indirect energy the banks energy consumption standard
compared with 2012 emissions were down 8 due to the 9 decrease in the use of indirect energy
the emission reduction was less than the variation of indirect energy consumption due to the worsening
of the emission factor associated to the purchase of electricity in portugal

in terms of waste millennium has agreements with entities specialised in collecting transporting and
reusing the main types of waste materials namely paper and cardboard plastic and ink and toner
cartridges in line with the reduction recorded in the use of materials waste production also decreased in
portugal and abroad by 17 and 13 respectively in portugal the most significant decrease in waste
produced between 2012 and 2013 was in terms of paper and cardboard due to the nationwide collection
of waste from the branches archives for destruction in 2012 which increased significantly the amount of
paper and cardboard disposed of that year

methodological note
scope of the report
the scope of the indicators reported is international and included the following operations in 2013
portugal poland romania mozambique angola and switzerland

report limitations
most quantitative indicators have records that go back three years the most significant limitations of the
report are related to the comparison and analysis of the indicators evolution

in 2010 began the reporting of angola and switzerland operations to the economic and social indicators
and are not directly comparable with reported in the 2009 sustainability report

in 2013 we proceeded to the recalculation of all environmental data presented in 2012 in order to include
the absolute values of angola and so enable comparability with the bank values reported in 2013 in 2013
failed to report greece operation however alienated thus much of the annual variations of the indicators
should be interpreted as and may be impacted by the greek operation output bcp group
