              i am pleased to report very good results once again this year a  llianz posted
              revenues of more than  110 bn for the first time ever while at the same
              time considerably increasing profitability at  101 bn our 2013 operating
              profit was one of the highest in our history we increased our net income by
              141  to  63 bn net income attributable to shareholders amounted to
               60 bn therefore we will propose a dividend of  530 per share

              with these results we held up very well not only against our international
              competitors we also continued to further improve our financial strength
              as evidenced by one of the best ratings of all insurance companies from the
              rating agency standard  poors furthermore our aa rating outlook was
              updated to stable by the same rating agency this represents an outstanding
              assessment of our capital strength and solidity the message is that your
              money is well invested in allianz shares

              this strong performance in such a challenging business environment is
              once again the impressive result of the efficiency and skill of o ur employees
              around the world  and of our distribution partners i would like to thank
              them for their remarkable efforts last year and i think that i also may offer
              these words of praise on your behalf as the owners of allianz

    it was a difficult year for all regions of the world with growth hampered by
    the need for structural adjustments the fiscal consolidation in the
    eurozone the fiscal gridlock in the united states and sizeable political risks
     especially in the middle east as a result global economic growth in 2013
    was even slightly lower than in the previous year while central banks have
    supported growth by making an almost unlimited supply of liquidity
    available the impact of persistently low interest rate levels represents a
    challenge for all savers and in turn for us as an insurer in addition severe
    hail storms and floods in 2013 had an adverse effect on our results in
    particular in germany and eastern europe

    even so we succeeded in making positive headlines for the second year in
    a row the propertycasualty business posted an increase in operating profit
    of 142  despite considerable losses from natural catastrophes we were
    more than able to make up for these losses with a big improvement at our
    us propertycasualty subsidiary firemans fund and an excellent contri
    bution to operating profit from allianz italy

    meanwhile our lifehealth revenues grew by 85  supported by strong
    growth in particular in germany and italy despite the general uncertainty
    among clients caused by the low interest rate environment while operating
    profit declined by 80 from the high level in the previous year in germany
    we launched a new life insurance product in 2013 with separate guarantees
    in the savings and payout phases which results in much less stringent
    capital adequacy requirements in return the client can expect higher
    returns this innovation met with a good response in the market

    the asset management business managed to post a record operating profit
    in 2013 with growth of 70  despite a challenging environment in
    the second half our asset manager pimco recorded outflows of funds

a   to our investors

17	supervisory board         21 allianz share




              following the debate in the united states on a gradual reduction of asset
              purchases by the federal reserve bank

              we continued to pursue our investments in future growth in a systematic
              manner this year we made an acquisition in turkey which makes us the
              market leader in one of the most attractive growth markets we bought the
              company  multiline insurer yapı kredi  in july at the same time securing
              a 15year exclusive distribution agreement with yapı kredi bank thanks
              to the acquisition of yapı kredi our market share in turkey is now almost
              comparable with our position in germany

              for the coming year we believe that allianz is well equipped to further boost
              its competitive position despite the challenges we face

              although the economies in europe and the united states are continuing to
              stabilize interest rates in both regions are likely to remain low for the
              foreseeable future the euro has meanwhile staged a strong recovery despite
              the european debt crisis being far from over while this is a welcome
              development in one sense it also has an adverse impact on exports and on
              the foreign revenues of european companies with international operations
              however without further diversifying our investment portfolio we wont
              achieve a satisfying investment performance on new investments in this
              context we also have to be attuned to currency fluctuations

              a further challenge is the need to tackle difficult detailed aspects of
              regulation  supervisory legislation solvency rules and the consequences
              of allianzs systemic relevance this ties up a lot of resources and could
              potentially lead to higher capital adequacy requirements for a    llianz in our
              opinion our strong capital position already covers such higher capital
              adequacy requirements today




                                                                                                  7

    alongside regulation another increasingly important theme is the digitali
    zation of our business models new technologies are enabling us to meet
    the evolving needs of our clients develop new products and tariffs and
    become more efficient and competitive in this context keeping our clients
    and companys data secure has been given top priority digitalization is
    a longterm project we have already achieved a great deal in recent years
    but there is still a lot of work to do if we are to take full advantage of the
    potential available to us

    we are pleased to note that our shareholders have also benefited from our
    success we see the increase of 244  in allianzs share price in 2013 as a
    sign that the markets agree with our strategy and our earnings stability for
    2014 we are aiming for an operating profit of  100 bn due to ongoing
    market volatility however we believe that this result may ultimately rise or
    fall by up to  500 mn we will continue to work hard to justify your trust in us

asset management market
for the asset management industry as a whole 2013 was a favorable
year although it was a further year of uncertainty in capital markets
with volatility remaining at elevated levels the announcement of the
federal reserve in may that it would start to take a reduction of its
asset purchases into consideration led to an increase in interest rates
the yield on 10year us government bonds increased from 16  at
the end of may 2013 to around 3  at the end of the year as a result of
the interest rate increase valuations for fixed income assets declined
while equities recorded a strong performance on a global basis
equities rose by 29  last year
     market flows into equity and fixed income strategies were par
ticularly strong in the first half of 2013 during the second half of the
year flows into traditional fixed income strategies were to a certain
extent impacted by the rise in interest rates flows into both shorter
term and floatingrate strategies continued to be strong while cer
tain investors found the higher yields presented new opportunities
in longerterm strategies flows into equity assets however mostly
continued throughout the year reaching levels not observed in the
recent past
     allianzs asset management operations recorded strong inflows
in areas such as nontraditional fixed income and multiasset the
overall flow development however was impacted by the general
market trend of outflows in the traditional bond space
     throughout 2013 both pimco and allianzgi reflected market
developments in their portfolio allocations and continued to deliver
outstanding client service from a strategic perspective pimco as
well as allianzgi went ahead with the implementation of their longer
term development plans in 2013 allianzgi engaged in further com
plexity reduction by combining entities while at the same time fur

crisis is that the insurance industry has been confronted with an
increasing degree of regulation alltime low interest rates and mar
ket insecurity and volatility remain critical factors for our business

with governments is to contribute solutions to sociopolitical issues
and create a stable political and economic landscape that will ben

in the propertycasualty sector overall market conditions were basi                              market flows into equity and fixed income were strong in the

advanced markets was underpinned by moderate rate increases and                              flows were to a certain extent impacted by the rise in interest rates
the gradual improvement of economic activity for example in the                             flows into equity assets mostly continued throughout the year
united states and germany on the other hand many markets in                                reaching levels not observed in the recent past these equity flows

in emerging markets generally proved robust despite turbulent                               development as well as rising asset valuations drove revenues and

to our own market estimates and based on preliminary figures global                         or marketing costs for example
premiums grew around 45  in 2013 adjusted for foreign currency
translation effects
     underwriting profitability improved slightly in 2013 reflecting
the general positive pricing momentum and the low level of natural
catastrophes but overall profitability was restrained by the challeng
ing investment environment despite small increases in the wake of
the assumed change in us monetary policy tapering interest
rates remained at low levels and investment returns were therefore
subdued

in the life sector global premium income growth recovered slightly
in 2013 this improvement was mainly led by emerging markets
which benefited from relatively strong increases in china and south
east asia latin america continued to post doubledigit growth as
well the performance of advanced markets was more mixed with
some  notably the us market  under pressure and others recover
ing rather strongly for example germany france and italy in total
according to our own market estimates and based on preliminary
figures global premiums grew by around 3  in 2013 adjusted for
foreign currency translation effects
      the persistent lowyield environment coupled with modest eco
nomic growth depressed new business profitability for traditional
life business insurance savings products continued to suffer from
weak demand against a backdrop of reduced guarantees however
risk protection products fared better these included not only tradi
tional mortality but also health insurance products such as disability
and longterm care insurance  which benefited from rising con
sumer awareness of a protection gap in these fields

for the asset management industry as a whole 2013 was a favorable
year although it was a further year of uncertainty in capital markets
with volatility remaining at elevated levels the announcement of the
federal reserve in may that it would start to take a reduction of its
asset purchases into consideration led to an increase in interest
rates the yield on 10year us government bonds increased from
16  at the end of may 2013 to around 3  at the end of the year as a
result of the interest rate increase valuations for fixed income assets
declined while equities recorded a strong performance on a global
basis equities rose by 29  last year

expenses from external debt decreased by  73 mn to  341 mn as rates

our internal it service provider
      administrative expenses net excluding acquisitionrelated
expenses grew by  93 mn to  684 mn mainly due to higher pension
costs as a result of lower discount rates

      investment expenses were down by  22 mn to  79 mn due to
increased cost recovery from other group companies

banking
our operating loss worsened by  57 mn to  91 mn due to higher
restructuring charges and a decrease in the net interest result
      in 2013 we incurred restructuring charges of  88 mn almost
completely related to the closure of the allianz banks business oper
ations in this context it is worth mentioning that our restructuring
charges have been presented within the operating profit since the
beginning of 2013 excluding the restructuring charges the operating
result in banking would have improved from 2012 by  31 mn to a loss
of  3 mn in 2013

      and 2012 respectively




net cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to  232 bn
up by  44 bn compared to the previous year net cash flow provided
by operating activities is comprised of net income plus adjustments
for noncash charges credits and other items included in net earn
ings and cash flows related to the net change in operating assets and
liabilities net income after adding back noncash charges and similar
items increased by  02 bn to  88 bn in 2013 additionally operating
cash flows from net changes in operating assets and liabilities
including other items grew by  41 bn to  144 bn this was driven by
higher reserves for insurance and investment contracts in our life
health business mainly in germany and the united states we also
recorded net cash inflows from financial assets and liabilities held
for trading as well as higher positive net changes from our operating
receivablespayables lower reserves for losses and loss adjustment
expenses in particular in our propertycasualty business in the united
states  as a result of the changed structure in our crop business 
partially offset these effects
      net cash outflow used in investing activities increased by  79 bn
to  228 bn in 2013 this rise was mainly attributable to higher net
cash outflows for availableforsale investments at our banking busi
ness in italy and our lifehealth operation in the united states
                                                                                                                  1   refers to cash flows from certificated liabilities and subordinated liabilities

governance
responsibility for ensuring the completeness accuracy and reliability
of our consolidated financial statements rests with the chairman of
the board of management and the board member responsible for
finance controlling and risk of allianz se supported by group center
functions the group disclosure committee and operating entities
     the group disclosure committee ensures that these board
members are made aware of all material information that could
affect our disclosures and assesses the completeness and accuracy
of the information provided in the quarterly and annual financial
reports the committee meets on a quarterly basis before the financial
reports are issued
      subsidiaries within the scope of our control system are individu
ally responsible for adhering to the groups internal control policy
and for creating local disclosure committees that are similar to the
grouplevel committee the entities ceos and cfos provide periodic
signoffs to the management of a   llianz se certifying the effectiveness
of their local system of internal controls as well as the completeness
accuracy and reliability of financial data reported to the holding

further control mechanisms
in our opinion a strong internal control environment is key to man
age our company successfully and to reinforce trust with our stake
holders in addition to icofr for example we have implemented an
enhanced internal control environment across our largest life insur
