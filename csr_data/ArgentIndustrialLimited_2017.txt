    chairmans statement
    the argent board of directors the board continues
    to believe that the groups core focus on branded
    manufactured products will create a sound base for both
    local and international sustainability and growth growth in
    forexrelated business will continue to be a key driver going
    forward both through offshore investment in existing and
    new operations and through driving exports

    the success of the group depends on a number of factors including but not limited
    to the human element without which the group could not or would not exist i would
    thus like to take this opportunity to express my genuine gratitude to the people who
    dedicate their time and efforts to the common goal of making the group a success

    to my fellow board members in particular treve and his team of executive directors
    your dedication commitment and unwavering loyalty to the group are qualities that
    are admired and respected in the difficult world of business your ongoing efforts to
    achieve and maintain the success of the group is greatly appreciated

    the employees of an organisation remain the most important resource within an
    organisation without the efforts and dedication of each and every employee of the
    argent group the continued growth and success of the group would not be achieved
    and i believe it is necessary to extend a heartfelt thank you

    the goal of a group such as argent is to make a profit while at the same time returning

22   argent annual report 2017

chief executive officers review
financial overview
argent industrial limited has had a successful year despite a challenging economic environment in south africa
the group continues to focus on its brands both locally and internationally

operations review
manufacturing
the division was adversely effected by the downturn in the south african economy and the improvement in the south
african exchange rates hendor mining was handed an unexpected court ruling by the constitutional court relating
to 2007 for which we had to provide r45 million in the current financial year details are disclosed in note 257 the
manufacturing brand division is the groups core focus and to this end it purchased both osa door parts limited a
uk manufacturer and supplier of industrial sectional insulated warehouse doors as well as 75 of pro crane services
pty ltd a johannesburgbased manufacturer and importer of overhead cranes details of the acquisitions can be
found in note 215 of the financial statements the acquisition of pro crane services was cash neutral

the groups main brands performed to expectations while the steel furniture and the jetmaster divisions showed
negative returns cedar paint being profitable has now been included in the manufacturing sector and is no longer
on the watch list

cedar paint is in the process of closing its bloemfontein branch as well as downsizing its klerksdorp branch we have
also consolidated the control of the durban operation into the pretoria factory which has reduced the administrative
costs and improved the financial control and customer service levels

steel trading
the steel trading operations continued to trade positively while emphasis has been on the reduction of stock holding
to this end phoenix steel gauteng to date has managed to reduce its yearend stock by r16 million in addition we
are in the process of reducing our steel exposure in cape town which will provide a further r15 million in stock relief

the current steel trading environment is very difficult with government hellbent on creating an inefficient singular
carbon steel supply monopoly while nullifying the local manufacturer via higher input costs we will continue
downsizing our carbon steel merchants until we have correctly matched our operational returns

automotive
the recent price increases did manage to turn this sector around however the sudden announcement from
general motors that they are disinvesting from south africa will result in our automotive plant being closed before
30 september 2017 the group has provided an additional r2 million in the form of stock provisions but has not
provided for the cost of retrenchments and the capital losses on equipment which will be market dependant

properties
there are no changes or expected changes in this division

outlook
the outlook remains positive as the group is well positioned to take advantage of any upswing in the south african
economy as well as being in a position where it can rely on its overseas operations for positive growth and as a hedge
against the rand one would need to take heed of south africas current macroeconomics and the unpredictability
of the local political environment and the consequent economic implications

the current years results should be seen in light of abnormal provisions of r45 million for hendor and r2 million
for sentech which would have improved the current years earnings to r94 million before tax

the groups offshore profit will be where possible used to make further investments into offshore brand operations while
the local profits and cash generating restructures will be used to reduce the overdraft and buyback the companies shares

the directors are responsible for the other information the other information comprises the directors report
the audit committees report and the company secretarys certificate as required by the companies act of south
africa which we obtained prior to the date of this report and the annual report the directors are responsible for
the other information the other information does not include the consolidated and separate financial statements
and our auditors report thereon

our opinion on the consolidated and separate financial statements does not cover the other information and we
do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon

in connection with our audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements our responsibility is to read
the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
consolidated and separate financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to
be materially misstated if based on the work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the
date of this auditors report we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are
required to report that fact we have nothing to report in this regard

responsibilities of the directors for the consolidated financial statements
the directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated and separate financial
statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards and the requirements of the companies
act of south africa and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation
of consolidated and separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud
or error

in preparing the consolidated and separate financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the
groups ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations
or have no realistic alternative but to do so

auditors responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and separate financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report
that includes our opinion reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with isas will always detect a material misstatement when it exists misstatements can
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated and separate
financial statements

as part of an audit in accordance with isas we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit we also

      identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether
       due to fraud or error design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit
       evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a




                                                                                         argent annual report 2017        29

         material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve
         collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal control
        obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
         are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
         of the groups internal control
        evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
         and related disclosures made by the directors
        conclude on the appropriateness of the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting and based
         on the audit evidence obtained whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
         that may cast significant doubt on the groups ability to continue as a going concern if we conclude that
         a material uncertainty exists we are required to draw attention in our auditors report to the related
         disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate to modify our
         opinion our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report
         however future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern
        evaluate the overall presentation structure and content of the consolidated financial statements including
         the disclosures and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions
         and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
        obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
         activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements we are
         responsible for the direction supervision and performance of the group audit we remain solely responsible
         for our audit opinion


     we communicate with the directors regarding among other matters the planned scope and timing of the audit and
     significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit

     we also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
     independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought
     to bear on our independence and where applicable related safeguards

     from the matters communicated with the directors we determine those matters that were of most significance in
     the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters
     we describe these matters in our auditors report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the
     matter or when in extremely rare circumstances we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our
     report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest
     benefits of such communication

     notes to the financial statements
     1         accounting policies
     11        basis of preparation
     the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs
     the south african companies act no 71 of 2008 the south african institute of chartered accountants saica
     financial reporting guides as issued by the accounting practices committee the financial reporting pronouncements
     as issued by the financial reporting standards council and the listings requirements of the jse limited

     the group financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of land and
     buildings and certain financial instruments which are carried at either fair value or amortised cost as appropriate and
     incorporate the following principal accounting policies which have been consistently applied in all material respects

     the financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which assumes that the group will continue
     in operation for the foreseeable future

     the accounting policies are the same as the prior year

     the following standards and interpretations were adopted but did not have an effect on the financial statements

     ifrs 5  noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations effective from 1 july 2016
     ifrs 7  financial instruments disclosures effective from 1 july 2016
     ias 19  employee benefits effective 1 july 2016
     ias 34  interim financial reporting effective 1 july 2016

     all amounts in the financial statements reports and supporting schedules are stated to the nearest r 000 except
     where otherwise indicated

     12        significant judgements
     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires management to make judgements estimates
     and assumptions that effect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities income and
     expenses the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors
     that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis of making the
     judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual
     results may differ from these estimates made by management from time to time

     the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates
     are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period
     of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods

     significant estimates and judgements are made in the following areas

          property plant and equipment  residual values and useful lives  note 14
          property plant and equipment  revaluation of land and buildings  note 3
          impairment of goodwill  note 4
          inventory  allowance for slow moving damaged and obsolete inventory  note 8
          trade receivables  allowance for doubtful debts  note 9
          deferred taxation  note 13
          contingent liabilities  note 25
          fair value of sharebased payments  note 22
          fair value of foreign exchange contracts  note 26
          fair value of financial liabilities  note 26

     13        basis of consolidation
     the group financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and all of its subsidiaries the parent
     controls a subsidiary if it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and
     has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary




38   argent annual report 2017

14       property plant and equipment
property plant and equipment except for land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses

depreciation is calculated on the straightline basis at rates considered appropriate to reduce book values over
the useful life of the assets to estimated residual values the depreciation method useful life and residual value
if significant are reassessed annually the current estimated useful life is as follows

item				average useful life

buildings				                            50 years
plant and equipment		                    15 years
motor vehicles			                        10 years
furniture fittings and equipment        3 to 10 years

land and buildings are carried at revalued amounts being the fair values at the date of revaluation less any
subsequent accumulated depreciation on buildings and subsequent accumulated impairment losses revaluations
are made with sufficient regularity such that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be
determined using fair value at the statement of financial position date any increase in an assets carrying amount
as a result of revaluation is credited to other comprehensive income the increase is recognised in profit and loss
to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss

the depreciation charge for each period is recognised in profit or loss unless it is included in the carrying amount
of another asset as no finite useful life for land can be determined related carrying amounts are not depreciated
the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property plant and equipment is included in profit or
loss when the item is derecognised the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property plant
and equipment is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds if any and the carrying amount
of an item

15       intangibles
intangible assets other than goodwill are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment intangible
assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives the amortisation
methods and estimated remaining useful lives are reviewed at least annually

expenditure on purchased patents is capitalised expenditure to extend the term of the patent is capitalised all
other expenditure is charged to the statement of profit or loss when incurred

internally generated brands mastheads publishing titles customer lists and items similar in substance are not
recognised as intangible assets

16       goodwill
goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of business combination over the companys
interest of the net fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities

subsequently goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses goodwill is allocated to cash
generating units and is tested annually for impairment

the excess of the companys interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities
over the cost of the business combination is immediately recognised in profit and loss as a gain on bargain purchases

17       investments in subsidiaries
the cost of an investment in a subsidiary is the aggregate of

     the fair value at the date of exchange of assets given liabilities incurred or assumed and equity
      instruments issued by the group
     any costs directly attributable to the purchase of the subsidiary plus
     longterm loans to subsidiaries capitalised to the cost of the investment

18       inventories
inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value cost includes all costs of purchase costs of
conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition

the amount of any writedown of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventories are recognised as
an expense in the period the writedown or loss occurs




                                                                                          argent annual report 2017             39

     loans tofrom group companies
     these include loans to subsidiaries and are recognised initially at fair value plus direct transaction costs

     subsequently these loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any
     impairment loss recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts

     on loans receivable an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that it is
     impaired the impairment is measured as the difference between the investments carrying amount and the present
     value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition

     trade and other receivables
     trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost
     using the effective interest rate method appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised
     in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired significant financial difficulties of the
     debtor probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in
     payments more than 90 days overdue are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired the allowance
     recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated
     future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition

     the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss
     is recognised in the statement of profit or loss within operating expenses when a trade receivable is uncollectible
     it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables subsequent recoveries of amounts previously
     written off are credited against operating expenses in the statement of profit or loss

     trade and other payables
     trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
     effective interest rate method

     cost using the effective interest rate method any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and
     the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the
     companys accounting policy for borrowing costs

     other financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective
     interest rate method

     other loans and receivables
     other financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are subsequently carried at
     amortised cost less any accumulated impairment

     derivatives
     derivative financial instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments consisting of foreign exchange
     contracts are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent
     reporting dates

     changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in profit or loss as they arise

to recovered from the tax authorities using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date

deferred tax assets and liabilities
a deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences

a deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that
taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised unless the deferred
tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that

    is not a business combination and
    at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit tax loss

a deferred tax asset is recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised

deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the
asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date

tax expenses
current and deferred taxes are recognised as income or an expense and included in profit or loss for the period
except to the extent that the tax arises from

    a transaction or event which is recognised in the same or a different period directly in comprehensive

113      impairments
the carrying amount of the groups assets other than inventories refer accounting policy note 18 and deferred
tax assets refer accounting policy note 111 are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is an
indication of impairment if any such indication exists the assets recoverable amount is estimated an impairment
loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cashgenerating unit exceeds its recoverable
amount impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss

the recoverable amount of the groups receivables at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated
future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate ie the effective rate computed at initial recognition
of these financial assets

the recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less cost to sell and value in use in assessing
value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for an asset that
does not generate largely independent cash inflows the recoverable amount is determined for the cashgenerating
unit to which the asset belongs


                                                                                           argent annual report 2017             41

     an impairment loss of assets carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation or amortisation is recognised
     immediately in profit or loss any impairment loss of a revalued asset is treated as a revaluation decrease

     goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the cashgenerating
     units or groups of cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination

     an impairment loss is recognised for cashgenerating units if the recoverable amount of the unit is less than the
     carrying amount of the unit the impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets of the
     unit in the following order

         first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cashgenerating unit and
         then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit

     114      foreign currency
     foreign currency transactions
     transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of group entities at exchange
     rates at the date of the transactions monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the
     reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at that date nonmonetary assets
     and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional
     currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined foreign currency differences arising
     on translation are recognised in profit and loss

     foreign operations
     the assets and liabilities of foreign operations including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition
     are translated to sa rand at foreign exchange rates at the reporting date the income and expenses of foreign
     operations are translated to sa rand at rates at the dates of the transactions foreign currency differences are
     recognised in other comprehensive income when a foreign operation is disposed of in part or in full the relevant
     amount in the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss

     115      leases
     a lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership
     a lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental
     to ownership

     operating leases  lessee

42   argent annual report 2017

119      shortterm employee benefits
the cost of all shortterm employee benefits is recognised during the year in which the employee renders the related
service the accruals for employee entitlements to remuneration and annual leave represent the amount which
the group has a present obligation to pay as a result of the employees services provided to the reporting date the
accruals have been calculated at undiscounted amounts based on current remuneration rates

120      sharebased payments
goods or services received or acquired in a sharebased payment transaction are recognised when the goods or
services are received a corresponding increase in equity is recognised if the goods or services are received in an
equitysettled sharebased payment transaction

when the goods or services received or acquired in a sharebased payment transaction do not qualify for recognition
as assets they are recognised as expenses in which case their value and the corresponding increase in equity are
measured directly at the fair value of the goods or services received unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably

if the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be estimated reliably their value and the corresponding
increase in equity are measured indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted

if the sharebased payments granted do not vest until the counterparty completes a specified period of service
the group accounts for those services as they are rendered by the counterparty during the vesting period or on a
straightline basis over the vesting period

if the sharebased payments vest immediately the services received are recognised in full

where the equity instruments are no longer outstanding the accumulated sharebased payment reserve in respect
of those equity instruments is transferred to retained earnings

121      borrowing costs
borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalised as part of the cost of that asset until such time as the asset is ready for its intended use

capitalisation is suspended during extended periods in which active development is interrupted

capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended
use or sale are complete

all other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred

122      government grants
when the conditions attached to government grants have been met they are recognised in profit or loss on a

     pledged security
     certain items of property plant and equipment are encumbered as set out in note 12		

     a register containing details of the property plant and equipment is available for inspection at the registered office
     of the company		

     valuation of land and buildings
     land and buildings is recognised at the revalued amount which is based on directors valuations prepared every
     year at yearend the carrying amount of properties is the fair value as determined by the directors less subsequent
     accumulated depreciation and impairment losses the effective date of the revaluations was 31 march 2017

     the fair values of the land and buildings are estimated using an income approach which capitalises the estimated
     rental income stream net of projected operating costs using a discount rate derived from market yields and take
     into account the type of the property and the propertys location

     the most significant inputs all of which are unobservable are the estimated rental value assumptions about vacancy
     levels and the discount rate the estimated fair value increases if the estimated rental increases vacancy levels
     decline or if discount rates market yields decline management considers that the range of reasonably possible
     alternative assumptions is greatest for rental values and vacancy levels and that there is also an interrelationship
     between these inputs the assumed discount rates applied for the future income streams range between 93 and
     1165

     the directors assessed the useful lives of the buildings to be 50 years and the residual values exceed their carrying
     values with the exception of new joules north america that has a useful life of 39 years

patents
the patent is a railway retarder and has a remaining useful life of 13 years

goodwill
goodwill is not amortised but subject to an annual impairment test for the purpose of annual impairment testing goodwill
is allocated to the relevant underlying cashgenerating unit cgu

goodwill amounting to r211 million is represented by 15 cgus no individual cgu is significant in comparison to the groups
total carrying amount of goodwill the recoverable amounts of the cgus are determined from value in use calculations

the key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates growth rates and expected
changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period management estimates discount rates using pretax rates that
reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specified to the cgus budgets are prepared
for a five year period the discount factor applied in the value in use model is between 135 and 15

the average projected growth rate used is 7 changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and
expectations of future changes in the market all the recoverable amounts are in excess of the carrying values and therefore
no impairments have been recongised

     the deferred tax asset in jetmaster pty ltd and paint and ladders pty ltd arises on temporary differences most
     specifically an assessed loss

     the directors have tested the deferred tax asset recognised for recoverability in terms of ias 12 the turnaround strategy
     supporting the recognition of this asset makes certain key assumptions which the board has considered and believes
     to be reasonable in the circumstances

     the principal assumptions are summarised as follows

            restructuring of certain brands and the closure of loss making divisions
            continued cost control and
            introduction of additional revenue streams which are reasonably and broadly achievable

     255     golden autumn trust  sentula

              the golden autumn trust the trust paid an amount of r88 million to argent for the purpose of allowing
              argent to pay such amount to sentulamegacube argent in turn paid sentulamegacube and the amount
              was received by sentulamegacube

              the trust was subsequently liquidated by sentulamegacube and the liquidators of the trust claimed back
              the payment of the r88 million from argent

              paying back the r88 million claimed by the trust would effectively result in sentulamegacube being paid
              twice and argent opposed the claim

              on 4 march 2015 judgement was granted against argent in favour of the liquidators of the trust for
              payment of r88 million plus interest and costs

              argent was granted leave to appeal to the full court and the appeal will proceed in the pietermaritzburg
              high court in december 2017

              argent believes that it will succeed in the appeal

              if argent loses the appeal it would then have to make a payment of r88 million interest thereon and
              legal costs

              argent has not made any provisions against the above

              financial years allegedly on behalf of argent and such subsidiaries

              the total amount claimed is in the region of r30 million plus interest and costs

              argent has defended the action instituted by megacube

              argent denies that it is liable to pay the amount claimed the interest and the costs

              argent has not made any provisions against the above

257   numsahendor

       on 30 march 2017 the constitutional court handed down judgment in an application for leave to appeal that
       concerned the nature of a claim for arrearwages following an employees reinstatement under section 1931a
       of the labour relations act 1995

       during august 2003 42 employees of argent steel group proprietary limited ta hendor mining supplies hendor
       were dismissed for participating in a strike on 16 april 2007 the labour court held that these dismissals were
       unfair and the employees were reinstated with effect from january of that year reinstatement order an appeal
       against the reinstatement order was dismissed by the labour appeal court in june 2009 and by the supreme
       court of appeal on 15 september 2009 the employees were reinstated on 29 september 2009 but hendor did
       not pay the arrearwages from 1 january 2007 to 28 september 2009

       dissatisfied the employees issued a writ of execution for the arrearwages in october 2010 this writ was set aside
       by the labour court in june 2011 on the basis that since the reinstatement order was not a moneyjudgment
       a valid writ could not be issued on its strength the employees were directed to file a declaration setting out
       the amounts owed to each one of them the employees brought a further application on 19 september 2012
       claiming the arrearwages hendor resisted the claim on the basis that since a period of more than three years
       had elapsed from the date the supreme court of appeal dismissed hendors application for leave to appeal against
       the reinstatement order the claim had prescribed

       the labour court rejected hendors argument it held that the claim for the arrearwages for the period 1 january
       2007 to the date of reinstatement constituted a judgment debt and therefore would only prescribe after 30 years
       the labour appeal court overturned the decision of the labour court holding that a claim for arrearwages
       arising out of a reinstatement order is a debt under the reinstated employment contract and would therefore
       prescribe after three years

       in this court the employees argued that the labour court was correct in holding that the claim for arrearwages
       was a judgment debt and as such it would prescribe only after 30 years in the alternative they argued that
       the earliest they could reasonably have come to know that hendor would not pay the arrearwages was on 29
       september 2009 when they reported for duty based on that they submitted that from 29 september 2009 to the
       date they launched their claim the threeyear period of prescription had not elapsed hendor argued in support
       of what the labour appeal court had held

       the first judgment written by madlanga j froneman j khampepe j and mbha aj concurring held that there was
       no legal distinction between the period before the reinstatement order and the period thereafter he held that the
       claim for arrearwages arose from the reinstatement order consequently the arrearwages constituted a judgment
       debt and as a result the claim will prescribe after 30 years the first judgment upheld the appeal with costs

       the second judgment written by zondo j mogoeng cj jafta j and mhlantla j concurring zondo j agrees with the
       first judgment that the claims have not prescribed that the workers are entitled to payment of their wages for the
       entire period and that the appeal should be upheld he also agrees that interest should be paid on the amounts
       owed and that hendor should pay costs however he disagrees with the reasons given in the first judgment for
       the conclusion that the claim has not prescribed

       the second judgment states that the claim falls into two distinct periods the one period is before the reinstatement
       order of 16 april 2007 namely from 1 january 2007 to 15 april 2007 first period the other is the period after
       the reinstatement order namely from 16 april 2007 to 28 september 2009 second period

       the second judgment took the view that the claim relating to the first period was a judgment debt because its
       payment was ordered in the reinstatement order it concluded that since the prescription period for a judgment
       debt is 30 years the claim for wages for that period had not prescribed however it took the view that the claim
       for the second period was not a judgment debt as the reinstatement order did not order payment of any wages
       for the second period the reinstatement order simply directed that the workers be reinstated the second
       judgment states that the claim was a contractual debt which was to be dealt with in terms of the principles of
       the law of contract the reinstatement of the workers resulted in the restoration of the contracts of employment
       of the workers

       the second judgment pointed out that the claim relating to the second period could not be a judgment debt
       this is because the labour court did not and could not have adjudicated upon the question of wages which had
       not even fallen due for payment at the time it made the reinstatement order on the facts the second judgment
       held that the threeyear period of prescription had not elapsed hence its agreement with the outcome reached
       by the first judgment

       the calculation of the amount of the award is difficult to ascertain as any claim of an employee is dependent in
       value on certain factors such as whether the employees had been gainfully employed and or capable of being
       employed during the above periods consequently this would have an effect on the rights the company would have
       in respect of the employees claims given that it would have had more staff than required and would operationally
       be entitled to take legal steps in this regard this would impact upon the values of the claims the company has
       requested certain information from numsa in order to quantify the value of the claim to date this information
       has not been forthcoming an amount of r45 million has been provided in the accounts as a provision on the
       above amount including interest and costs

267     capital management
capital is regarded as total equity the groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor
creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business the board of directors also
determines the level of dividends paid to shareholders

the group may purchase its own shares on the market if the cash resources of the company are in excess of its
requirements in this regard the directors will take into account inter alia an appropriate capitalisation structure
for the company and the longterm cash needs of the company and will ensure that any such utilisation is in the
interest of the shareholders

the group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of interestbearing borrowings to total equity this ratio is
calculated as interestbearing borrowings divided by total equity as follows

                                                                         group                         company

     268         fair value measurement
     fair value measurement of financial and nonfinancial instruments
     assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into three levels of a
     fair value hierarchy the three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement
     as follows

            level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
            level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
             either directly or indirectly and
            level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability

     the following table sets out the groups assets and liabilities that are measured and recognised at fair value

measurement of fair value of financial and nonfinancial instruments
the groups finance team performs valuations of financial items for financial reporting purposes including level 3 fair
values in consultation with third party valuation specialists for complex valuations valuation techniques are selected
based on the characteristics of each instrument with the overall objective of maximising the use of marketbased
information the finance team reports directly to the financial director fd and to the audit and risk committee

valuation processes and fair value changes are discussed among the audit and risk committee and the valuation
team at least every year in line with the groups reporting dates

the valuation techniques used for instruments categorised in level 2 and 3 are described below

foreign currency forward contracts level 2
the groups foreign currency forward contracts are not traded in active markets these have been fair valued using
observable forward exchange rates and interest rates corresponding to the maturity of the contract the effects of
nonobservable inputs are not significant for foreign currency forward contracts

land and buildings level 3
the groups land and buildings and plant and equipment is estimated based on appraisals performed by the
directors the valuation processes and fair value changes are reviewed by the board of directors and audit and risk
committee at each reporting date

the fair values of the land and buildings are estimated using an income approach which capitalises the estimated
rental income stream net of projected operating costs using a discount rate derived from market yields and take
into account the type of the property and the propertys location

the most significant inputs all of which are unobservable are the estimated rental value assumptions about
vacancy levels and the discount rate the estimated fair value increases if the estimated rental increases vacancy
levels decline or if discount rates market yields decline

management considers the range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions is greatest for rental values and
vacancy levels and that there is also an interrelationship between these inputs the assumed discount rates applied
for the future income streams range between 93 and 1165

the reconciliation of the carrying amounts of nonfinancial assets classified within level 3 is as follows

     each entity we value all of the employees in the group and the value that they add to achieving the sustainable
     profitability of the entities and the group as a whole

     the board defines the remuneration philosophy and aligns the business strategy and objectives with the overall
     goal of extracting optimal performance from the enterprise and thus creating shareholder value to ensure fair
     and responsible remuneration practices we seek a balance between employee and shareholder interests while
     promoting entrepreneurial drive throughout the organisation we simultaneously strive to maintain a balance
     between risk and reward

     the remuneration committee bases its recommendations on information gathered from an individual company
     and group perspective and bases its recommendations on this performance

     five key performance criteria that shape our policy are

          realistic profit targets when warranted by exceptional circumstances special bonuses may be considered as
          additional rewards
     4   occasionally and as a consequence of the groups needs management may be redeployed to take on new
          responsibilities and in such cases subjective criteria may need to be applied when making an evaluation and
