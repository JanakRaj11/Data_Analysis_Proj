                                          more than a decade ago the network was positioned to become the platform to enable
                                          transactionsentering orders on line conducting internetbased searches and email today we
                                          believe we are about to enter the next major phase of the internets impact on business and life
                                          experiences and it will be driven by collaboration and web 20 technologies we believe this next
                                          phase will have a dramatic impact on productivity innovation the way we communicate and the way
                                          we live

                                          technology when combined with process change has the ability to influence all aspects of our
                                          business and personal lives including our contribution to the global economy ciscos long
                                          standing commitment to corporate social responsibility csr extends from transforming global

                                          commitments we have made to corporate sustainability

                                          in this third annual corporate citizenship report we provide details on our progress in addressing
                                          corporate social responsibility the risks and opportunities that affect the sustainability of our
                                          business and our contributions to the global community

                                          companies in todays global economy are not only accountable for the quality of their products and
                                          the profitability of their businesses they also have an obligation to fulfill social and environmental

                                          communities in which they operate ciscos commitments are built on our ability to help facilitate
                                          collaboration and provide citizens communities countries and businesses with access to
                                          information and opportunities that improve the way people work live play and learn in this way we
                                          can increase the power of the human network

                                          since ciscos inception we have had a culture and philosophy of corporate social responsibility
                                          and community involvement it is embedded in our dna and driven through our vision strategic
                                          planning and execution the results of ciscos efforts are reflected in the prestigious awards we
                                          have received over the years for our exemplary global business practice

                                          cisco is committed to environmental responsibility in our business operations products and
                                          network architecture design this past year we established an ecoboard to set an environmental
                                          strategy and oversee companywide environmental programs we believe that through the power of
                                          the network people are empowered to work live play and learn in an environmentally sustainable
                                          way this can be accomplished through reduction in transportationrelated emissions using
                                          collaborative technologies such as cisco telepresence and cisco unified communications and
                                          also through improvements in workspace utilization and reductions in energy consumption our own
                                          collaborative technologies have the ability to reduce our carbon footprint by decreasing employee
                                          travel and we can in turn show our customers partners and suppliers how to do the same

                                                at cisco we believe that we must attract and retain the most talented people in our
                                                industry in order to remain competitive so we listen carefully to what our employees
                                                worldwide say about the kind of workplace they want and then develop programs
                                                to address those needs we also solicit feedback to help ensure that leaders direct
                                                reports peers internal clients and external customers have an opportunity to assess our
                                                employees efficacy and satisfaction

                                                as in previous years in fy07 we devoted substantial time to listening to our employees
                                                and we continued to improve current employee programs exploring opportunities
                                                to increase flexibility in work arrangements and to enhance our employees ability to
                                                successfully integrate their work and home lives we also introduced innovative programs
                                                to enhance employee health and wellbeing as well as to promote diversity and inclusion

                                          at cisco we believe that our ability to maintain our competitive advantage is rooted in the quality of
                                          our workforce we believe that there is a high correlation between motivated committed employees
                                          and the historically high levels of customer satisfaction that cisco achieves to help retain the best
                                          talent we listen closely to our employees and respond to their suggestions and feedback

                                          an important tool for garnering that feedback is the cisco pulse survey which provides a
                                          confidential and consistent means for employees across cisco to rate their experience with the
                                          company and offers ciscos leadership clear information on how well the company is performing as
                                          an employer

at cisco were committed to our vision changing the way we work live play and learn and this extends to our ability to reduce
the effects of our operations and products on the environment together with our customers partners employees and communities
we have a unique opportunity to help organizations and individuals use technology in environmentally sustainable ways

in october 2006 john chambers established the cisco ecoboard to lead company initiatives for environmental sustainability and to
set priorities and goals across all departments engaged in environmental activities the ecoboard is comprised of leaders from 12 key
areas of ciscos business ranging from engineering to operations to employee communications to government affairs

as cochairs of the ecoboard we set an ambitious agenda to not only reduce ciscos greenhouse gas emissions but also to deliver
opportunities for our customers to operate in more environmentally sustainable ways in the future the network will be the key technology
enabler to manage monitor and better utilize energy and achieve more significant greenhouse gas emissions reductions globally

we characterize ciscos commitment to environmental sustainability as three actions

 operations lessen our emissions of greenhouse gases
 products maximize product functionality and performance while optimizing and reducing power consumption
 architecture deliver networking architectures and solutions that enable customers to achieve environmental goals

at the operations level we helped reduce greenhouse emissions from cisco facilities in fy07 by using renewable power we
purchased an additional 799 million kilowatthours kwh of green power for our headquarters in san jose bringing our total purchase
for united states facilities to 886 million kwh and globally to 115 million kwh

our engineering team is dedicated to reducing energy consumption by our products the goal is to design in environmental
efficiency and to design out waste in addition we are building and taking full advantage of new collaboration technologiessuch
as telepresence unified communications and webexto reduce the need for travel in fy07 we committed 222 million to our
collaborative technologies to facilitate a 10percent reduction in greenhouse emissions from air travel

perhaps the most dramatic effect we can have with our customers is related to the architectural design of our solutions we are
working to develop more energyefficient network architectures for the business data center and for wireless networks at a solutions
level we have launched initiatives such as connected urban development which uses converged ipenabled infrastructures in urban
areas and new technologies such as radiofrequency id and mobility to reduce urban energy consumption and to lower emissions
created by traffic congestion

as the ecoboard leaders we are excited about harnessing the power of the network to promote a more environmentally sustainable
future we look forward to working with our customers partners employees and communities to address the serious environmental
challengesand opportunitiesthat face us all

cisco and the environment                 cisco connected real estate
                                          cisco networking infrastructure solutions can also improve energy efficiency by facilitating the
                                          design monitoring and control of multiplebuilding management systems traditionally buildings
                                          required several separate systems to handle electrical environmental heating ventilation and air
                                          conditioning security communications and other functions

                                          the cisco connected real estate program integrates the control and management of these
                                          systems with ciscos network infrastructure this enables 24hour onsite or offsite control of all
                                          building systems over a single ip network the technology is even able to integrate devices such as
                                          printers and copiers into the energymanagement system and it can spot unauthorized personal
                                          equipment plugged into office electrical outlets

                                          a study commissioned by the converged buildings technology group a consortium of building
                                          system manufacturers found that this converged network approach generated capital savings of 24
                                          percent during the building construction phase and reduced operating expenses by 30 percent
                                          over the life of a building our own studies also show a dramatic reduction in electrical demandby
                                          more than 40 percent

                                          ciscos extensive network of laboratorieswhere we develop configure and test our equipment
                                          typically consumes 5 to 22 times as much energy as equivalent office space to reduce power
                                          consumption in laboratories cisco has developed the automated managed power system amps
                                          which identifies equipment that is not in a test cycle and powers it down on average amps
                                          reduces equipment power consumption by 40 percent representing a substantial savings in both
                                          greenhouse gas emissions and electricity bills

                                          now fully deployed in our automated test center atc laboratories which represent about 5
                                          percent of ciscos total lab space amps is saving approximately 65000 per month directly by
                                          turning off idle equipment and indirectly by reducing the load on building airconditioning systems
                                          during fy08 we plan to deploy amps in other business units and technology groups across the
                                          company

                                          cisco is also deploying a webbased monitoring system called tmon in our labs the tmon system
                                          graphically displays equipment usage and power status over time and generates equipment usage
                                          and powersavings management reports if equipment has been left on inadvertently tmon sends

cisco and the environment                 green power purchasing
                                          cisco is entering its second year of a green power purchase agreement to procure 100percent
                                          renewable power for our uk facilities representing approximately 26 million kilowatthours kwh
                                          per year this agreement saves enough power to meet the needs of 2400 uk homes in addition
                                          cisco again participated in the us environmental protection agencys green power challenge a
                                          13month campaign focusing on the collective power purchases of eligible fortune 500 companies
                                          the challenge is part of the epas green power partnership program which provides assistance
                                          and recognition to organizations that demonstrate environmental leadership through the purchase
                                          of green renewable power

                                          in fy07 we purchased more green power than ever before including an additional 799 million kwh
                                          for our headquarters site this brought the total green power purchases for us facilities to 886
                                          million kwh and the total for our worldwide facilities to 115 million kwh according to epa estimates
                                          ciscos us green power purchases are equivalent to preventing more than 124 million pounds
                                          56400 metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere combined with our uk
                                          initiatives this represents the prevention of 69000 metric tons of carbondioxide emissions per year

cisco and the environment                 reducing water use
                                          the growing human population places great demands on the worlds supply of fresh water climate
                                          change may also exacerbate water shortages in certain regions because water conservation
                                          benefits everyone cisco continues to search for ways to reduce water usage and to use recycled
                                          water where appropriate

                                          our successful waterless urinal pilot project in restrooms at our san jose headquarters in fy06
                                          prompted us to install more than 400 additional waterless units throughout the campus we estimate
                                          that water consumption will decrease by more than 85 million gallons per year once installation is
                                          complete in early fy08 we also seek to reduce water use in the restroom sinks we installed 60
                                          taps with sensors in our brussels office and in san jose we are testing faucets with solarpowered
                                          sensors that help minimize both water and energy consumption

                                          at our headquarters in san jose we use only recycled water for landscape irrigation and fountains
                                          which represents approximately 30 percent of our total 700000 cubic feet of water consumption
                                          cisco is reducing the amount of water used in irrigation by installing smart controllers that employ
                                          webbased technology to automate and optimize landscape watering schedules using weather
                                          forecasting data and horticultural science in california alone we are saving more than 81 million
                                          gallons of water each year due to our water conservation efforts

                                           through an audit most of our major worldwide facilities are iso 14001 certified

                                           at each cisco site included in the program a team uses the ems framework to identify prioritize
                                           and manage the most relevant and important environmental impacts issues range from managing

                                           waste water treatment initiatives may arise from sitespecific operational practices or from
                                           local community concerns cisco identifies best practices through the ems audit program and
                                           disseminates them throughout the company

                                           to increase efficiency and reduce the expense and environmental impact of traveling to audited
                                           sites during cy07 approximately 30 percent of iso 14001 internal audits have been remote or

                                           modular and scalable so the product can be upgraded instead of replaced
                                           compatible with previous and future versions of cisco processing cards so obsolescence is

                                          energy efficiency is of particular concern in consumer electronic devices and appliances that are
                                          sold in large volumes even in idle or standby mode home devices such as computers network
                                          equipment home entertainment products and telephones continue to draw power when multiplied
                                          by millions of households this adds up to billions of kilowatthours

                                          here are three examples of powerreduction features that we have incorporated into our consumer
                                          products

                                           spindown and screen saver the hard drive in the scientific atlanta settop digital video recorder

                                            unless the user presses a remote key once spindown is complete and the screen saver is active
                                            the drive remains spun down until the user presses a remote or front panel key
                                           lowpower modes on ip phones cisco unified communications manager version 4 provides
                                            a central command that can darken the displays on all the ip phones connected to a network
                                            at a given time after business hours this can save up to 25 percent of a phones typical energy

                                            current even when it is not in use according to the us governments energy star program
                                            these power adapters consume about 300 billion kwh per year approximately 11 percent of
                                            the national electric bill in 2006 the california energy commission enacted title 20 to make
                                            external power adaptors more efficient all ciscos power adapters meet this standard and we are
                                            addressing similar standards in australia the european union and the rest of the united states

                                          besides designing power efficiency into individual products cisco is also lowering power
                                          consumption in data centers with modular scalable solutions that make better use of existing
                                          capacity for example ciscos networkbased virtualization capabilities help customers increase

                                          approach to systems design helps make data centers greener by reducing the number of power
                                          consuming appliances that need to be connected to the network

                                          the convergence of data center infrastructure applications and operations has also opened new
                                          opportunities for power efficiency at the systems level ciscos intelligent networks provide a solid

                                          program all contracts with suppliers make reference to the supplier code of conduct and
                                          suppliers agree to the tenets of the code before working with us

                                          in 2007 our supplier assessment process started with our participation in the eicc joint pilot
                                          audits the pilot consisted of thirdparty audits of more than a dozen eicc member facilities in
                                          china including both contract manufacturers and commodity suppliers using the eiccdesigned
                                          tools and reporting format the audits focused on the labor environmental health safety ethics
                                          and management system aspects of the code of conduct the results of these audits enable cisco
                                          to identify potential opportunities for improvement and work with our suppliers to resolve any
                                          challenges

                                          beyond our supplier assessment program cisco is also evaluating other aspects of supplier
                                          performance including ozonedepleting chemical use energy consumption and waste disposal

cisco and the environment                 supplier diversity
                                          many of ciscos suppliers are small businesses or independent contractors that provide a number
                                          of services diversity among these suppliers is an important aspect of ciscos supply chain
                                          philosophy we believe diversity is good for our business in a variety of ways

                                           regional diversity gives us access to worldwide skills and markets and provides business
                                            resiliency if disruptions should occur in a particular region it also helps reduce transportation
                                            costs
                                           cultural diversity with suppliers offering different viewpoints and styles of interacting helps us
                                            develop and market products that fit the needs of the broad global community
                                           social diversity promotes inclusiveness that benefits communities and local economies

                                          any time we engage a new partner we conduct an assessment that takes into account financial
                                          technological geographic and political risks in this way we try to avoid possible problems by
                                          making sound business resiliency decisions at the outset regional diversity helps us balance
                                          the risks to the supply chain posed by such factors as potential civil unrest natural hazards and
                                          economic uncertainties

                                          the cisco global supplier diversity business development gsdbd program was established
                                          more than 15 years ago to provide equal access to businesses owned by minorities women
                                          disabled people and military veterans as well as to companies in historically underutilized
                                          business zones hubzones cisco has an internal goal of awarding 10 percent of our supplier
                                          expenditures to such businesses

                                          the gsdbd team also provides ongoing supplier diversity training throughout ciscos business
                                          units to help identify diverse suppliers cisco is working with external inclusion organizations as
                                          well as with ciscos own employee networks we also have implemented a vendor management tool
                                          that allows us to manage and prioritize certified diverse suppliers

                                          for the past four years cisco has been recognized for our supplier diversity efforts by
                                          diversitybusinesscom cisco ranks as one of the top 50 us companies providing multicultural

                                           achieving universal education
                                           promoting gender equality
                                           reducing child mortality

                                          nearly every country in the world has approved these goals and we believe companies such as
                                          ours have a responsibility to help make them a reality as well

                                          environments we have applied that knowledge to other cisco and joint education initiatives such

                                          of every 100 students entering high school in impoverished parts of north carolina only 19 will
                                          complete a two or fouryear college degree program as a native north carolinian a mother of two
                                          and the daughter of a dedicated teacher cisco employee kathryn robinson viewed that figure as a
                                          tragedy

                                          so in june 2006 robinson joined the north carolina new schools project ncnsp as a volunteer
  what this group was                    through the cisco leadership fellows program
  doing appealed to me in
  so many ways they really
                                          the eastern and western parts of the state have really been ravaged by the flat world globalized
  took a holistic approach
                                          economy she says with the textile industrys move to china and the changes to the tobacco
  to education reform its
  not just about improving                industry came very high unemployment rates and that has affected the schools abilities to offer a
  or testing content or even             quality education without an educated capable workforce these areas cant attract new industries
  improving instruction its             and the cycle continues
  about integrating all of
  those things                          in addition to providing executivelevel volunteers to the organization cisco donated equipment
                                          and provided a cash grant of 50000 to aid ncnsp in its mission to improve high school graduation
  kathryn robinson
                                          rates by expanding students use of technology in the classroom but access to technology and
                                          grants is only part of the solution giving these students a competitive edge requires changing
                                          instructional methods to enable them to use the tools effectively
