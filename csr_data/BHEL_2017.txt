chapters on business sectors under annexure1 of management discussion and analysis
climate change is the most potent problem the world is facing today significant cuts in the emission
of green house gases ghg during energy generation need to be achieved through either substi
tuting higher emission
generation technology with
lower emission technology
or by employing energy
efficiency measures it
presents a lot of opportuni
ties for companies like bhel
and at the same time
presents many challenges
particularly related to the
development of green
technologies with emis
sions norms getting more
stringent there is an oppor      bhel has successfully developed and demonstrated 50kwp spv systems

then in the third  final stage the relevant issues which are material to the company as well as the
stakeholders are prioritised through a simple matrix
for the reporting period 201516 like the previous year the following issues have been found to be
key material issues for the company and the same are reported in this document in detail




              economic performance


                climate change




                                                                                        identified key material issues

                   occupational health  safety


                  material consumption


                water


             effluent and waste




it may also be noted that major impact of our product and services lies outside our boundary during
the life cycle of the power plant which is beyond the control of bhel to minimise the environmental
impacts of our products and services bhel is continuously striving for more efficient power plant
equipment and development of greener technologies also emission during transportation of our
products across our presence is there but we are unable to capture it at present
there is no significant change in our operations or supply chain from previous reporting periods
however due to incorporation of 3 years data for our pppu thirumayam unit there has been a
modification in the scope and aspect boundary of the identified material issues as compared to
previous reports the environmental indicator data for pppu thirumayam has been added this year
and consequently the same is incorporated in the data for 201314  201415 leading to minor
adjustment in the data reported in our sustainability report for 201314  201415

                          our environmental performance

management approach  sustainability
with time global community realised that though rapid development is a must for enhancing the
quality of life of the world populace but at the same time our natural capital needs to be protected
assiduously that is where the concept of sustainable development also known as triple bottom
line approach fits in which guides us through the path of development which is broad based
equitable benefitting the society to the maximum extent possible and attained through operating
within the confines of assimilative capacity of our natural environment so for bhel sustainability is
about enhancing stakeholder value while operating within the virtual boundary set by the
assimilative capacity of the natural environment and distributing the fruits of this created value in an
equitable manner
since its inception bhel has been leveraging technology and innovation for providing products
systems and services to its customers and enabling them to use resources with better efficiency and
productivity which is evident from our mission statement  providing sustainable business
solutions in the fields of energy industry  infrastructure to help achieve the ecological
sustainability throughout our operations we have been taking key projects  initiatives in the areas
of renewable energy generation through solar systems tree plantation water conservation energy
efficiency workplace environment improvement resource conservation etc megawatt scale solar
power plant at bap ranipet 5 mwp hpep hyderabad 15 mwp and trichy complex 5 mwp are the
milestones in our journey towards ensuring environmental sustainability in our operations
governance for sustainability
bhel believes that while governance for sustainability stakeholder engagement and disclosure on
sustainability issues forms the bedrock for embedding sustainability within the organisational dna
the performance on environmental and social issues linked with its business is the ultimate measure
of sustainability to institutionalise the concept of sustainability bhel has enunciated its
sustainability policy and ensures adherence to the guidelines on corporate social responsibility
csr and sustainability issued by department of public enterprises under ministry of heavy
industries and public enterprises for central public sector enterprises bhel discloses its
performance on sustainability issues through annual sustainability report

like previous year key material issues pertaining to environmental indicators as identified for 2015
16 are material usages energy water effluents  waste management the data pertaining to these
identified material issues are provided in the following sections
responsible use of natural resources
conservation and effective utilisation of natural resources have become a mainstay in our business
process the company has an institutionalised mechanism to recycle the products and wastes
generated to the extent feasible for example the general practice adopted to minimise waste
generation at source in use of steel plates are
f computerised nesting plan of each steel plate to adjust maximum number of jobs in a plate
f preservation and reuse of offcuts generated after nesting  using them for cutting out smaller
   jobs like strong lifting lugs  tackles etc
many manufacturing units are having foundry shops wherein the recycling of local ferrous scrap
happens these small but significant steps help us in reducing the use of precious natural resources
and consequently reducing the environmental footprint of bhel further on an aggregate basis
approx 35 of materials used at bhel are recycled input material on account of the use of ferrous
scraps for making castings and forgings etc
at our central foundry  forge plant cffp located at haridwar for making castings and forgings
molten steel is prepared using only ferrous scrap the steel scrap used in the process is partly
generated in cffp itself and the rest is obtained from other manufacturing units and project sites
thus making the molten steel produced an almost 100 recycled product eprocurement in bhel is
also being implementing in phased manner as a business improvement initiative and sustainable
business practice
due to large variation in our products and services and consequently varied input materials across
the organisation measurement of material consumption in terms of weight or volume of raw
materials consumed in physical terms as per gri guidelines could not be established and
consequently the actual trend of material consumption could not be established at present in
absolute physical terms further our project sites have a cycle time of 35 years and the relationship
between gto and material consumption may not be correlated in a simple way this present a
limitation to our data reporting as per the gri g4 guidelines
however the data about resource consumption by entire organisation in last 5 financial years is
presented in the figure below along with gross turn over gto figures as shown in the figure this
cost varied from 42 to 50 of our gto figures during the last 5 years and average stood at almost
46 it is a clear indication of underlying gamut of opportunities and challenges for optimal use of
material resources and cost optimisation through better procurement practices to enhance the
competitiveness of our products  services various initiatives such as design optimisation

liquefied petroleum gas lpg regasified liquefied natural gas rlng dissolved acetylene da
furnace oil fo etc bhel is moving towards more and more use of cleaner fuels like natural gas
which is being used in many units like heep haridwar cffp haridwar ip jagdishpur epd bengaluru
and lpg which is being used at hpep hyderabad and trichy unit this year the diesel consumption in
our units has gone down drastically

it may be noted that usage of coal in our operations have been coming down since last 2 years with
respect to energy derived from primary fuels further the usage of diesel have come down very
drastically in the last couple of years this is largely due to fuel switch from diesel to rlng at our energy
intensive central foundry forge plant cffp haridwar through conversion of all oilfired burner to
natural gas fired burners further our epd bangalore unit has switched over to rlng from lpg

further on the tonnage basis it can be seen that use of fuels like coal diesel etc which requires
physical carriage through means of transportation is going down which directly contributes
towards savings in indirect energy uses for transportation of fuels and thereby reducing the carbon
footprint of bhel

the average energy intensity defined as total energy consumed in giga joules per lakh  of gross

similarly the figure for energy productivity defined as gto achieved in lakh of  per giga joules of

110 however it may be noted that the data for gto encompasses entire bhel whereas the energy
usage data is restricted to reporting boundary for environmental parameter only it clearly
established the fact that the energy productivity was at its peak when the gto achieved was
maximum in the history of bhel similarly the energy intensity was at its lowest for 201213 when
the gto was at its peak

various additional activities were also undertaken like process redesign conversion and retrofitting
of equipments educational programmes to bring changes in employees behaviour etc these
activities have resulted in overall energy savings of 3629 tj of energy including 3575 tj of indirect
energy saved in terms of electricity due to enconee activities during fy 201516 during the last 3
years on an average 8152 tera joules tj of energy usages have been avoided out of which 3252 tj
was on account of fuel savings and rest 49 tj were saved on account of savings in the consumption
of electricity per annum it may be noted that recurring savings has not been included in this data
and only fresh projects undertaken during the reporting period has been considered for calculation
of annual energy saving projections
further it may be noted that the absolute quantity of energy usages avoided on account of encon
activities have declined during the recent past it may be attributed to the fact that in earlier times
switching to cleaner fuels and energy efficient technologies have been taken at drastic pace as per
the requirement of business however with time the scope in the uptake of newer energy efficient
technologies has reduced due to marginal returns and as most of the identified opportunities have

bhel being a major supplier of power plant equipments is very much aware of its social
responsibility for making conscious efforts towards the use of sustainable energy mix in its own
operations use of renewable energy solar power in our manufacturing activities is gradually going
up on account of the generation of solar energy
talking about mega watt scale solar installations  at bhels bapranipet unit we have a 5 mwp grid
interactive solar power plant at hpephyderabad unit we have a 15 mwp solar power plant and
further a 5 mwp solar power plant is under installation at our trichy unit this will take total
installation capacity of mwp scale plants to 115 mwp all of these are meant for captive use further
we have several kilo watt kw scale systems which add upto 734 kwp including rooftop systems
installed across various units of bhel overall these systems have generated around 1635 million
units of green electricity since 201112 which is equivalent to 5886 tera joules of energy

water usages  its conservation in our premises
we at bhel believe that since water is a common natural resource it is our fiduciary duty to use it
efficiently efficient usages of water inside the organisation is a value proposition as well we always
strive for managing the water and wastewater system in our premises in a sustainable manner to
meet the requirements and expectations of our stakeholders this is the premise which enabled us
in making water management a part of our strategy and despite our growth in the past our water
consumptions have not changed significantly keeping the broader objectives of our countrys
national water policy 2012 which lays emphasis on water reuse  recycle and making our industrial
units as zero liquid discharge zld units many of our units have already achieved the status of zld
plant and remaining units are working towards achieving this objective

as can be seen from the figure the average quantity of water drawn from different sources at our
units during the last 5 years stood at 1573 million cubic metre further the contribution of different
water sources is also shown in the figure as evident from the figure groundwater is the major
source of water in our units followed by surface water and municipal supply further it may also be
noted that at our epd bengaluru unit rainwater is collected and used inside the premise in our
premises water saving is done through creating awareness in employees measuring water
consumption ensuring optimum use of water recycling of water installing water saving
equipments routine checks for pipes leakages etc
during the reporting period a total volume of 347 million m3 of effluent was discharged from
various manufacturing units of bhel which is nearly 2237 of water drawn for 201516 all the
waste water quality related parameters were within the prescribed limit of discharge as specified by

            in horticulture firefighting reservoir is also maintained using treated water




biodiversity conservation within our premises

none of our units is surrounded by any biodiversity reserve or protected area with respect to its
concern for environmental protection and soil conservation bhel has undertaken afforestation
activities such as mass tree plantation and development of green belt which has resulted in
development of nearly 47 million m2 of green coverage and plantation of nearly 3 million trees

however as far as the significant impact of our operationsactivities on biodiversity is concerned
there is no significant impact of our activities on biodiversity and as such there is no habitat which is
being protected or restored by the company

the total emission for the last 5 years stood at 277 million metric tonnes mmt of co2 equivalent
mmt co2e indicating an average annual emission figure of 055 mmt co2e it may be noted that
during 201213 our gross turnover was all time high however the corresponding emission was not
at its peak
as can be seen from the figure the aggregate carbon footprint of our units is showing a declining
trend scope1 emissions have come down consistently during the last 5 years it shows that the use
of fuels which are cleaner is being increasingly used across bhel
it is pertinent to mention here that the major impact of our products is beyond our premises and at
the customers end during use however it is our endeavor to provide greener technologies having
lesser carbon footprint to our customers the quantification of such emissions is beyond our scope
the figure below gives the information about the electricity purchased by our manufacturing units
during the last 5 years and indirect emission scope2 associated with it the calculation has been
done using the grid emission factor for both the electricity grids in india and the same has been
shown in the table below it may be noted that during 201516 the grid has become integrated and
so there is only one emission factor for the entire grid of the country

the data for carbon intensity defined as carbon footprint in mt co2e per crore  of gross turnover
and carbon productivity defined as gross turnover achieved in lakh  per unit of carbon footprint
in mt co2e is shown in the following figure the average figure of carbon intensity stood at 1461
mt co2e per crore  of gto indicating that for  1 crore of gross turnover achieved during the last
5 years on an average 1461 mt of co2equivalent was released in atmosphere similarly talking
about the figure of carbon productivity the average figure for last 5 years stood at  714 lakh per
mt co2e indicating that for each mt co2e emission a corresponding gto of  714 lakh was
achieved however it may also be seen that though during 201213 the organisation achieved a
record gto but neither the carbon intensity was at its maximum nor the carbon productivity at
minimum during 201213 further the data for carbon intensity has started increasing during the
last 3 years on account of drastic reduction in gross turnover achieved

however it may be noted that the gto has been taken for entire bhel whereas the emissions have
been considered only for units under the reporting boundary the figure is being presented here
only for comparison purpose as the reporting boundary has been same for the data presented here
the analysis of this trend is not done thus far due to a complex interplay of our product line

the contribution of major fuels used across bhel contributing in scope1 emission is shown in the
figure as it can be seen from the figure there is a consistent reduction in scope1 emission which
may be attributed to the following factors
    lesser gross turnover requiring less fuel
    enhanced use of cleaner fuels in our operations
    due to generation of green solar energy inside our premises
    better electricity availability position

as can be seen from the figure the contribution of diesel in overall scope1 emission has decreased
drastically during last 3 years the contribution of emissions due to rlng has gone up significantly
indicating a shift from more polluting fuel to the less polluting source of energy the decrease in
carbon footprint contribution due to lpg can be attributed to the fact that at cffp and epd
bengaluru fuel switch has occurred from lpg to rlng the emission level is showing a consistently
declining trend

although we are not capturing the data for scope3 emission yet but it is evident that we are
reducing our scope3 emissions since we are increasing the use of rlng which is supplied through
pipelines and does not require physical carriage through conventional means of transportation like
tanker etc
due to sustained efforts for reducing our carbon footprint through various means like energy
efficiency  conservation efforts and enhancing usages of solar energy generated inhouse we
have avoided a significant amount of carbon emission as can be seen from the figure a significant
amount of direct emission has been avoided during 201112 201213  201314 it may be
attributed to improvement in the calorific value of fuel fuel saving due to process improvement fuel
switch to cleaner fuels which has led to avoidance of scope1 emissions in a considerable way

the average and cumulative carbon footprint avoided during the last five years stood at 173932
metric tonnes of carbon dioxide  equivalent mt co2e and 86966 mt co2e it included
cumulative avoidance of scope1 emissions to the tune of 49681 mt of co2e and scope2
emissions of around 37195 mt co2e it may be noted that the calculation for carbon emission
avoidance has been done on projected annual energy saving basis and we dont have a procedure in
place to measure the exact saving in energy and consequent carbon emission avoidance
in addition to it a significant amount of scope2 emission is avoided due to the generation of green
energy inside our premises a 15 mwp solar power plant has been commissioned in dec15 at our
hpep hyderabad unit this has resulted in an addition of already existing 5 mwp generation capacity
of solar energy at bap ranipet unit further a 5 mwp plant is under installation at our trichy unit
during the reporting period many solar street lights rooftop solar power plants solar water heaters
etc have been installed which has resulted in enhancement of our green energy generation
capacity

as indicated we have reduced the consumption of diesel and other conventional fuels which
require transportation by road thereby reducing the scope3 emission on account of carriage of
these fuels through road transport however no quantification is available for these savings
responsible waste management
we at bhel strongly believe in the popular quote waste is just a resource in the wrong place bhel
has been very conscious about its responsibilities towards conservation and protection of
environment right from its inception we firmly believe that sound waste management is very
critical for the success of environmental management system it is not only critical for ensuring
cleanliness prevention of pollution and conservation of resources but also very important as a
strategic tool for sustainability of businesses sound waste management is considered to be one of
the main pillars of the concept of sustainability
in view of this responsible waste management has always been an important thrust area in bhel
the principle of 3r reducerecyclereuse is practised widely in our organisation at the planning
stage efforts are made to minimise the waste the company has an institutionalised mechanism to
recycle wastes inhouse to the extent feasible for example each mt of the molten steel produced at
our cffp unit contains 54 of the recycled scrap of cffp and 45 of ms scrap from other bhel
units thus making it an almost a 100 recycled product various coolants used in our machines are
recovered after use and recycled again after appropriate treatment

recycledreused inside our premises sent to cffp haridwar or sold to the authorised agencies for
recycling further there has been no hazardous waste as per basel convention which has been
shipped internationally the waste generated has decreased during 201516 this may be attributed
to lesser physical turnover and efficient use of material leading to reduction in waste generated
