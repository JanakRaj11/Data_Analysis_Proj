      community

      communitycoopers work
      extends beyond products and
      customers
      corporate giving and community outreach have been a part of cooper
      industries operating philosophy and business practices for decades
      the cooper industries foundation a nonprofit section 501c3 private
      foundation funded by company contributions was founded in 1964
      additional corporate giving is done by each of the eight business divi
      sions globally as a part of the annual budget and planning process

      to date the community outreach and charitable giving programs that
      originate at the business division level which comprise a significant
      portion of cooper industries overall corporate giving programs have
      only been reported on a dollars expended basis the rationale has
      been to give the local cooper business leaders broad discretion in
      determining what will best serve their particular communities the
      company believes this approach best serves all of the interests at
      stake allowing good societal activities to be done at the local level
      while allowing the managers and employees to focus most of their time
      and energies on creating and delivering great products to customers
      which in turn creates the profits that allow coopers charitable pro
      grams to thrive

      the variety of programs and grant requests that are funded reflects the
      diversity of the people and places where cooper operates this section
      highlights some of these community investments

      governance and ethics

      in 1833 charles and elias cooper founded the company that would become
      cooper industries ltd today cooper is a publicly traded corporation
      organized under the laws of bermuda the companys administrative
      headquarters is located in houston texas where all of the members of
      the companys senior management team are resident as are all of the
      corporate officers the rationale for organizing the company under the
      laws of bermuda while maintaining the principal executive offices in the
      united states is to give the company an equal footing with its nonusa
      based competitors particularly with regard to issues of income and taxa
      tion for its operations around the world some may take issue with the
      companys decision claiming that it results in the company not paying
      its fair share of us taxes but this is both incorrect and overly simplistic
      the current legal structure allows cooper to maintain its large manufac
      turing and employment infrastructure in the united states and compete
      more effectively in global markets while returning maximum value to its
      shareholders
