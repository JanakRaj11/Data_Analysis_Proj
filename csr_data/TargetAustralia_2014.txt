a message from our managing director
i am pleased to share with you our progress
on sustainability throughout 2014 at target
we strive to be a sustainable ethical and socially
responsible business we work to make a positive
difference in all parts of our business by being active
members of our communities promoting diversity
ensuring our products are sourced ethically and by
minimising our environmental impact

a major highlight this year was achieving our 50000th
buddy bag packed for the alannah  madeline foundation
to help kids fleeing violent situations this cause is close
to our hearts and we are proud to have supported the
foundation for over six years now

i am also proud that we have increased our commitment
to diversity through the launch of our aboriginal  torres
strait islander plan which has already begun to create
genuine employment and commercial opportunities for
indigenous communities since launching earlier in the year

our strong safety record continued to improve with a
number of initiatives launched to achieve a 32 per cent
reduction in our lost time injury frequency rate and a 13
per cent reduction in total recordable injury frequency rate

we continued to strengthen our ethical sourcing practices
including establishing an office in bangladesh and
increasing our transparency by publishing our bangladesh
suppliers names on our website with a commitment
to sharing our entire list by end of 2015

we have also increased our commitment this year to
reducing our environmental footprint by investing in
energy efficiency initiatives across our network of stores

these highlights and more are shared throughout this
report while we are making great progress we still have
a lot to do i am looking forward to sharing ever bigger
and better things in 2015

ethical sourcing
at target we believe that our presence in bangladesh and
other developing countries can be a catalyst for improving
the lives of thousands of workers we want our customers to
be confident that the products they buy from us have been
produced in safe fair and equitable working conditions

throughout 2014 we have conducted hundreds of factory
audits to ensure workers are being treated properly and
that their working conditions are safe and secure over
this time our business has been particularly focused on
bangladesh factory suppliers while only approximately five
per cent of store range is sourced from bangladesh recent
factory tragedies have reinforced the need for retailers
operating in that country to ensure they play an active role
in improving working conditions and safety standards

we continue to invest in an ethical and transparent supply
chain this year we established a target direct sourcing
office in bangladesh employing more than 30 people
which allows us to stay close to our bangladesh factory
partners and make sure they are operating safely and
in a manner target and our customers expect

these initiatives are the next steps in our journey to building
a worldclass transparent and ethicallydriven sourcing
program target is proud of its transparent sourcing model
and is committed to ongoing improvements

increasing our transparency
in 2014 target published a list of its bangladesh
factory partners as part of its commitment to ensuring
transparency and safe working conditions in its overseas
supplier factories supply chain transparency is key to our
commitment to improving working conditions and safety
standards in bangladesh and other sourcing countries

we have a responsibility to ensure that everyone who works
for our business whether directly or indirectly is safe in their
workplace this is also a concern for our customers who
want to know that the products they purchase from target
are sourced and produced ethically target is one of the first
australian retailers to publicly commit to publishing details
of its factory suppliers

oxfam australia has applauded our actions stating
that targets disclosure of bangladesh supplier factory
locations will enable researchers ngos and civil society
groups to independently check workers conditions by
speaking to workers on site we urge other australian
retailers to be open about where they source their garments

environment
waste
this year target funded the collection and recycling of
12 tonnes of televisions and computer waste under the
national television and computer recycling scheme
product stewardship agreement with dhl supply chain
our contribution to this scheme provided access to 97
of unwanted electronics with 90 percent of the collected
materials recycled

we are working to reduce the quantity of our waste and
to divert as much as possible to recycling both in our
operations and for our customers this year a number
of activities aimed at tidying our stores to improve the
customer experience and team member safety contributed
to an increase of 6 in our waste we diverted 222 tonnes
of recyclable waste and 77 tonnes went to landfill

as a retailer we can have an impact on waste by considering
the life cycle of the products we sell and make changes to
how products are packaged target has made commitments
in relation to packaging under the australian packaging
covenant apc to which wesfarmers is a signatory

the apc is a voluntary packaging waste reduction and
recycling initiative between governments the packaging
industry retailers and consumer brand owners
