    report of the chairman and ceo




    introduction
    despite comprising brands and franchises that are both wellestablished and recognised in south africa we
    recognise the fact that our business journey towards success and sustainability is an ongoing one we have
    identified the following business goals or objectives for 2013
       to become the most desirable beauty franchise group in south africa
       to expand the support structure for franchisees to ensure their sustainability and profitability
       to attract and retain worldclass managers and beauty therapists technicians and hair stylists throughout
        the salon group and
       to consistently introduce innovative beauty products and services
    all of these have been developed in line with our mission of making a positive change in the world through
    selfimprovement and selfempowerment by increasing the selfesteem of our customers
    financial overview
    group revenue increased by 155 to r715 million 2012 r619 million during the year as a result of increased
    marketing the introduction of new brands high technology skin rejuvenation and hair removal machines and
    increased royalty income earned from the perfect 10 franchise chain acquired and existing outlets in the group
    gross profit increased by 33 to r438 million 2012 r424 million and gross profit margins decreased by
    72 to 613 2012 685 due to the introduction of new brands and promotional offerings distributed by
    the group to beauty salons which attract lower margins
    operating expenses increased by 47 to r412 million 2012 r393 million however marketing and advertising
    spend grew 30 compared to the previous period the group incurred onceoff costs of approximately
    r2 million during the year mainly due to the change of name of the holding company and the underlying
    subsidiaries and other costs associated with the acquisition of the perfect 10 franchise chain
    the definite highlights of 2013 year were
       the integration of the perfect 10 acquisition into the imbalie beauty group
       the increase in group revenue by 155
       renovation and relocation of 31 outlets and
       positive cash flows generated from operating activities
    the performance of the companys growth in earnings and headline earnings were flat when compared to the
    previous year and earnings per share decreased to 057 cents 2012 107 cents while headline earnings per
    share decreased to 058 cents 2012 107 cents the decline in earnings and headline earnings per share can
    be attributed primarily to the increase in shares in issue as a result of the company issuing shares for cash at
    the beginning of the 2013 financial year to fund the perfect 10 acquisition
    corporate outlets to the value of r75 million which are available for resale are included in inventories it will
    be a priority for management to sell these outlets to franchisees in order to strengthen the cash flow of the
    group during the year the group opened a dream nails beauty concept outlet in jubilee mall and relocated
    three of its corporate outlets in port elizabeth welkom and pretoria north to better locations which led to
    the increase in inventories on hand
    to fund the acquisition of perfect 10 the company completed a general issue of shares for cash whereby
    109 375 000 ordinary shares were placed with a number of independent public shareholders at a price of
    16 cents per share raising r175 million the general issue for cash
    the company has also entered into a loan agreement whereby the company secured a r5 million three year
    term loan at an interest cost of 8 per annum the total amount of r225 million raised was utilised to settle
    the perfect 10 purchase consideration repay other longterm liabilities and to strengthen the companys
    balance sheet
    the material increase in intangible assets relates to the acquisition of perfect 10 and the trademarks and
    franchise agreements acquired by the group

     1   presentation of annual financial statements
          the annual financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting
          standards the companies act and the listing requirements of the jse limited the annual financial
          statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the measurement of financial
          instruments which is measured at fair value cash flow information which is measured on a cash basis and
          land and buildings which is measured at fair value and incorporate the principal accounting policies set
          out below
          except for the adoption of the new and revised accounting standards the principal accounting policies of
          the group are consistent with those applied in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year
          ended 29 february 2012
          they are presented in south african rands
          standards and interpretations effective in 2014
          a full list of standards that will become effective in the next financial year are disclosed in note 2
          11   consolidation
                basis of consolidation
                the consolidated annual financial statements incorporate the annual financial statements of the
                company and all entities including special purpose entities which are controlled by the company
                control exists when the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an
                entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities
                the results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated annual financial statements from the
                effective date of acquisition to the effective date of disposal
                adjustments are made when necessary to the annual financial statements of subsidiaries to bring
                their accounting policies in line with those of the group
                all intragroup transactions balances income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation
                noncontrolling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified and recognised
                separately from the groups interest therein and are recognised within equity losses of subsidiaries
                attributable to noncontrolling interests are allocated to the noncontrolling interest even if this
                results in a debit balance being recognised for noncontrolling interest
                transactions which result in changes in ownership levels where the group has control of the subsidiary
                both before and after the transaction are regarded as equity transaction and are recognised directly
                in the statement of changes in equity
                the difference between the fair value of consideration paid or received and the movement in non
                controlling interest for such transactions is recognised in equity attributable to the owners of the
                parent
                where a subsidiary is disposed of and a noncontrolling shareholding is retained the remaining
                investment is measured to fair value with the adjustment to fair value recognised in profit or loss as
                part of the gain or loss on disposal of the controlling interest
                business combinations
                imbalie beauty limited and its subsidiaries determines whether a transaction or other event is a
                business combination by applying the definition in accordance with ifrs 3 which requires that the
                assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business if the assets acquired are not a business
                the reporting entity accounts for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition
                the group accounts for each business combination by applying the acquisition method applying the
                acquisition method requires
                a   identifying the acquirer
                b   determining the acquisition date
                c   recognising and measuring the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any

        d   recognising and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase
        the company acquirer measures the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their
        acquisitiondate fair values
        the cost of the business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values of assets
        given liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued costs directly attributable to the
        business combination are expensed as incurred except the costs to issue debt which are amortised
        as part of the effective interest and costs to issue equity which are included in equity
        contingent consideration is included in the cost of the combination at fair value as at the date
        of acquisition subsequent changes to the assets liability or equity which arise as a result of the
        contingent consideration are not affected against goodwill unless they are valid measurement
        period adjustments
        the acquirees identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities which meet the recognition
        conditions of ifrs 3 business combinations are recognised at their fair values at acquisition date
        except for noncurrent assets or disposal group that are classified as heldforsale in accordance
        with ifrs 5 noncurrent assets heldforsale and discontinued operations which are recognised at
        fair value less costs to sell
        ifrs 3 reconsiders the application of acquisition accounting for business combinations major changes
        relate to the measurement of noncontrolling interests the accounting for business combinations
        achieved in stages as well as the treatment of contingent consideration and acquisitionrelated
        costs based on the new regulation noncontrolling interests may be measured at their fair value
        fullgoodwillmethod or at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
        in business combinations achieved in stages any previously held equity interest in the acquiree
        is revalued to its acquisition date fair value any changes to contingent consideration classified
        as a liability at the acquisition date are recognised in profit and loss acquisitionrelated costs are
        expensed in the period incurred
        the requirements in ias 37 do not apply in determining which contingent liabilities to recognise
        as of the acquisition date instead the company acquirer recognises as of the acquisition date a
        contingent liability assumed in a business combination if it is a present obligation that arises from
        past events and its fair value can be measured reliably therefore contrary to ias 37 the acquirer
        recognises a contingent liability assumed in a business combination at the acquisition date even if it
        is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle
        the obligation
        on acquisition the group assesses the classification of the acquirees assets and liabilities and
        reclassifies them where the classification is inappropriate for group purposes this excludes lease
        agreements and insurance contracts whose classification remains as per their inception date
        for each business combination the acquirer measures at the acquisition date components of non
        controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to
        a proportionate share of the entitys net assets in the event of liquidation at either
        a   fair value
        b   the present ownership instruments proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the
              acquirees identifiable net assets
              all other components of noncontrolling interests are measured at their acquisitiondate fair
              values unless another measurement basis is required by ifrs
        noncontrolling interest arising from a business combination is measured either at their share of
        the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquiree or at fair value the treatment is not an
        accounting policy choice but is selected for each individual business combination and disclosed in
        the note for business combinations
        in cases where the group held a noncontrolling shareholding in the acquiree prior to obtaining
        control that interest is measured to fair value as at acquisition date the measurement to fair
        value is included in profit or loss for the year where the existing shareholding was classified as an
        availableforsale financial asset the cumulative fair value adjustments recognised previously in other
        comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are recognised in profit or loss as a reclassification
        adjustment

                                                                                                                   31

             goodwill is determined as the consideration paid plus the fair value of any shareholding held prior
             to obtaining control plus noncontrolling interest and less the fair value of the identifiable assets and
             liabilities of the acquiree
             goodwill is not amortised but is tested on an annual basis for impairment if goodwill is assessed to
             be impaired that impairment is not subsequently reversed
             upon disposal the attributable carrying value of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit
             or loss on disposal
             subsidiaries
             subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group the financial statements of subsidiaries are included
             in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date the
             control ceases investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment adjustments in the
             companys separate financial statements
             the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the
             policies adopted by the group
       12   significant judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty
             in preparing the annual annual financial statements management is required to make estimates
             and assumptions that affect the amounts represented in the annual annual financial statements
             and related disclosures managment used the most relevant information that is available and the
             application of judgement is inherent in the formation of estimates actual results in the future could
             differ from these estimates which may be material to the annual financial statements
             significant judgements include
             trade receivables
             the group assesses its trade receivables for impairment at the end of each reporting period in
             determining whether an impairment loss should be recorded in profit or loss the group makes
             judgements as to whether there is observable data indicating a measurable decrease in the estimated
             future cash flows from a financial asset
             the impairment for trade receivables is calculated on a asset by asset basis based on historical loss
             ratios and other indicators present at the reporting date that correlate with defaults on the portfolio
             allowance for slow moving damaged and obsolete stock
             an allowance for stock to write stock down to the lower of cost or net realisable value is made
             management have made estimates of the selling price and direct cost to sell on certain inventory
             items
             fair value estimation
             the carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to
             approximate their fair values the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated
             by discounting the future contractual cash flows at 17 that is available to the group for similar
             financial instruments
             impairment testing
             the recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units and individual assets have been determined based
             on the higher of value inuse calculations and fair values less costs to sell these calculations require
             the use of estimates and assumptions it is reasonably possible that the assumption may change
             which may then impact our estimations and may then require a material adjustment to the carrying
             value of goodwill and tangible assets
             the group reviews and tests the carrying value of assets when events or changes in circumstances
             suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in addition goodwill is tested on an
             annual basis for impairment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows
             are largely independent of cash flows of other assets and liabilities if there are indications that
             impairment may have occurred estimates are prepared of expected future cash flows for each group
             of assets expected future cash flows used to determine the value in use of goodwill and tangible
             assets are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time

  12   significant judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty continued
        taxation
        judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes due to the complexity of
        legislation there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is
        uncertain during the ordinary course of business the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax
        audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due where the final tax outcome
        of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will
        impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made
        the group recognises the net future tax benefit related to deferred income tax assets to the extent
        that it is probable that the deductible temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future
        assessing the recoverability of deferred income tax assets requires the group to make significant
        estimates related to expectations of future taxable income estimates of future taxable income
        are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each
        jurisdiction to the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates
        the ability of the group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the end of the reporting
        period could be impacted
        goodwill
        goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the purchase consideration over the groups
        share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired
        subsequently goodwill is carried at at cost less any accumulated impairment goodwill is tested
        annually for impairment the excess of the groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable
        assets liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of the business combination is immediately
        recognised in profit or loss
        property plant and equipment and intangible assets
        management has applied its judgement in assessing the useful life and the residual value of property
        plant and equipment and intangible assets as presented in the accounting policies the residual
        values useful lives and depreciation methods applied to assets are reviewed at each financial year
        end based on relevant market information and management consideration
  13   property plant and equipment
        the cost of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised as an asset when
             it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the company
              and
             the cost of the item can be measured reliably
        property plant and equipment is initially measured at cost
        costs include costs incurred initially to acquire or construct an item of property plant and equipment
        and costs incurred subsequently to add to replace part of or service it if a replacement cost is
        recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property plant and equipment the carrying amount
        of the replaced part is derecognised
        revaluations are made with sufficient regularity with regard to land and buildings such that the
        carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at
        the end of the reporting period
        any increase in an assets carrying amount as a result of a revaluation is recognised to other
        comprehensive income and accumulated in the revaluation surplus in equity the increase is
        recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset
        previously recognised in profit or loss
        any decrease in an assets carrying amount as a result of a revaluation is recognised in profit or loss
        in the current period the decrease is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any
        credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset the decrease recognised in
        other comprehensive income reduces the amount accumulated in the revaluation surplus in equity
        when an item of property plant and equipment is revalued any accumulated depreciation at the
        date of the revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net
        amount restated to the revalued amount of the asset

                                                                                                                     33

       13   property plant and equipment continued
             the revaluation surplus in equity related to a specific item of property plant and equipment is
             transferred directly to retained earnings when the asset is derecognised
             the revaluation surplus in equity related to a specific item of property plant and equipment is
             transferred directly to retained earnings as the asset is used the amount transferred is equal to the
             difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount and depreciation based on
             the original cost of the asset
             property plant and equipment are depreciated on the straight line basis over their expected useful
             lives to their estimated residual value land is not depreciated and revalued annually
             property plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
             losses except for land and buildings which is carried at revalued amount being the fair value at the
             date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated
             impairment losses
             property plant and equipment is carried at revalued amount being the fair value at the date of
             revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment
             losses

             the residual value useful life and depreciation method of each asset are reviewed at the end of each
             reporting period if the expectations differ from previous estimates the change is accounted for as
             a change in accounting estimate
             the depreciation charge for each period is recognised in profit or loss unless it is included in the
             carrying amount of another asset
             the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property plant and equipment is included
             in profit or loss when the item is derecognised the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of
             an item of property plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the net disposal
             proceeds if any and the carrying amount of the item
       14   intangible assets
             an intangible asset is recognised when
                   it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will
                    flow to the entity and
                   the cost of the asset can be measured reliably
             expenditure on research or on the research phase of an internal project is recognised as an expense
             when it is incurred
             an intangible asset arising from development or from the development phase of an internal project
             is recognised when
                   it is technically feasible to complete the asset so that it will be available for use or sale
                   there is an intention to complete and use or sell it

              there are available technical financial and other resources to complete the development and
               to use or sell the asset
              the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably
        intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses
        an intangible asset is regarded as having an indefinite useful life when based on all relevant factors
        there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash
        inflows amortisation is not provided for these intangible assets but they are tested for impairment
        annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired for all other intangible
        assets amortisation is provided on a straight line basis over their useful life
        the amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets are reviewed every
        periodend
        reassessing the useful life of an intangible asset with a finite useful life after it was classified as
        indefinite is an indicator that the asset may be impaired as a result the asset is tested for impairment
        and the remaining carrying amount is amortised over its useful life
        internally generated brands mastheads publishing titles customer lists and items similar in substance
        are not recognised as intangible assets
        amortisation is provided to write down the intangible assets on a straight line basis to their residual
        values which is assessed annually as follows
        item                                                         useful life

        company annual financial statements
        in the companys separate annual financial statements investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost
        less any accumulated impairment
        the cost of an investment in a subsidiary is the aggregate of
              the fair value at the date of exchange of assets given liabilities incurred or assumed and
               equity instruments issued by the company plus
              any costs directly attributable to the purchase of the subsidiary

        the group classifies financial assets and financial liabilities into the following categories
              loans and receivables
              financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
        classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were obtained  incurred
        and takes place at initial recognition
        initial regoction and measurement
        financial instruments are recognised initially when the group becomes a party to the contractual
        provisions of the instruments




                                                                                                                    35

       16   financial instruments continued
             the group classifies financial instruments or their component parts on initial recognition as a financial
             asset a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual
             arrangement
             financial instruments are measured initially at fair value
             for financial instruments which are not at fair value through profit or loss transaction costs are
             included in the initial measurement of the instrument
             subsequent measurement
             loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
             method less accumulated impairment losses
             financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method
             derecognition
             financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have
             expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of
             ownership
             financial liabilities are derecognised when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or
             expire
             fair value determination
             if the market for a financial asset is not active and for unlisted securities the group establishes
             fair value by using valuation techniques these include the use of recent arms length transactions
             reference to other instruments that are substantially the same discounted cash flow analysis and
             option pricing models making maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on
             entityspecific inputs
             impairment of financial assets
             at each reporting date the group assesses all financial assets other than those at fair value through
             profit or loss to determine whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of
             financial assets has been impaired
             for amounts due to the group significant financial difficulties of the debtor probability that the
             debtor will enter bankruptcy and default of payments are all considered indicators of impairment
             impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss
             impairment losses are reversed when an increase in the financial assets recoverable amount can
             be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised subject to the
             restriction that the carrying amount of the financial asset at the date that the impairment is reversed
             shall not exceed what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not been recognised
             reversals of impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss except for equity investments classified
             as availableforsale
             where financial assets are impaired through use of an allowance account the amount of the loss is
             recognised in profit or loss within operating expenses when such assets are written off the write off
             is made against the relevant allowance account
             subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses
             loans tofrom group companies
             these include loans to and from holding companies fellow subsidiaries subsidiaries joint ventures
             and associates and are recognised initially at fair value plus direct transaction costs
             loans to group companies are classified as loans and receivables measured at amortised cost
             loans from group companies are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

        trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured
        at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method appropriate allowances for estimated
        irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the
        asset is impaired significant financial difficulties of the debtor probability that the debtor will enter
        bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered
        indicators that the trade receivable is impaired the allowance recognised is measured as the
        difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows
        discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition
        the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the
        amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss within operating expenses when a trade receivable
        is uncollectable it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables subsequent
        recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in profit or loss
        trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables

        amortised cost
        bank overdraft and borrowings
        bank overdrafts and borrowings are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured
        at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method any difference between the proceeds

        periods the excess is recognised as an asset
        current tax liabilitiesassets for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected
        to be paid to recovered from the tax authorities using the tax rates and tax laws that have been
        enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period

                   it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future
             a deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is
             probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can
             be utilised unless the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
             transaction that
                   is not a business combination and
                   at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit tax loss

             is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be
             utilised the directors assessed that the assessed tax losses will be recovered based on profitability
             forecasts
             deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the
             period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have
             been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period

  18   leases continued
        the discount rate used in calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest
        rate implicit in the lease
        the lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and reduction of the outstanding
        liabilitythe finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a
        constant periodic rate on the remaining balance of the liability
        operating leases  lessee
        operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term
        the difference between the amounts recognised as an expense and the contractual payments are
        recognised as an operating lease liability this liability is not discounted
        any contingent rents are expensed in the period they are incurred
  19   inventories
        inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value
        net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated
        costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale
        the cost of inventories comprises of all costs of purchase costs of conversion and other costs
        incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition
        the cost of inventories is assigned using the firstin firstout fifo formula the same cost formula
        is used for all inventories having a similar nature and use to the entity
        when inventories are sold the carrying amount of those inventories are recognised as an expense in
        the period in which the related revenue is recognised the amount of any writedown of inventories
        to net realisable value and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period the
        writedown or loss occurs the amount of any reversal of any writedown of inventories arising
        from an increase in net realisable value are recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories
        recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs
  110 impairment of assets
        the group assesses at each end of the reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset
        may be impaired if any such indication exists the group estimates the recoverable amount of the
        asset
        irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment the group also
             tests intangible assets with an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not yet available for use
              for impairment annually by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount this
              impairment test is performed during the annual period and at the same time every period
             tests goodwill acquired in a business combination for impairment annually
        if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired the recoverable amount is estimated for the
        individual asset if it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset the
        recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs is determined
        the recoverable amount of an asset or a cashgenerating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs
        to sell and its value in use
        if the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the
        asset is reduced to its recoverable amount that reduction is an impairment loss
        an impairment loss of assets carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation or amortisation is
        recognised immediately in profit or loss any impairment loss of a revalued asset is treated as a
        revaluation decrease to the extent of any revaluation asset surplus recognised on the asset
        goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the
        cashgenerating units or groups of cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the
        synergies of the combination




                                                                                                                      39

       110 impairment of assets continued
              an impairment loss is recognised for cashgenerating units if the recoverable amount of the unit is
              less than the carrying amount of the units the impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying
              amount of the assets of the unit in the following order
                   first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cashgenerating unit and
                   then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset
                    in the unit
              the entity assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss
              recognised in prior periods for assets other than goodwill may no longer exist or may have decreased
              if any such indication exists the recoverable amounts of those assets are estimated
              the increased carrying amount of an asset other than goodwill attributable to a reversal of an
              impairment loss does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no
              impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods
              a reversal of an impairment loss of assets carried at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortisation
              other than goodwill is recognised immediately in profit or loss any reversal of an impairment loss of
              a revalued asset is treated as a revaluation increase
       111   share capital and equity
              an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after

              rendered such as paid vacation leave and sick leave bonuses and nonmonetary benefits such as
              medical care are recognised in the period in which the service is rendered and are not discounted
              the expected cost of compensated absences is recognised as an expense as the employees render
              services that increase their entitlement or in the case of nonaccumulating absences when the
              absence occurs
              the expected cost of profit sharing and bonus payments is recognised as an expense when there is
              a legal or constructive obligation to make such payments as a result of past performance
       113 provisions and contingencies
              provisions are recognised when
                   the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event
                   it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to
                    settle the obligation and
                   a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation
              the amount of a provision is the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle
              the obligation future expenditure is discounted at the pretax discount rate reflecting the market
              assessment of the time value of money adjusted for risks associated with the obligation
              where some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed
              by another party the reimbursement shall be recognised when and only when it is virtually certain
              that reimbursement will be received if the entity settles the obligation the reimbursement shall be
              treated as a separate asset the amount recognised for the reimbursement shall not exceed the
              amount of the provision
              provisions are not recognised for future operating losses
              if an entity has a contract that is onerous the present obligation under the contract shall be recognised

  113 provisions and contingencies continued
      after their initial recognition contingent liabilities recognised in business combinations that are
      recognised separately are subsequently measured at the higher of
            the amount that would be recognised as a provision and
            the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation
      contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised contingencies are disclosed in note 32
  114 earnings per share and headline earnings per share
      the group presents basic and diluted earnings per share eps for its ordinary shares basic eps is
      calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders by the weighted average
      number of ordinary shares in issue during the period
      diluted eps is determined by adjusting the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and the
      weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for any dilutive effects
      the calculation of headline earnings per share is based on the net profit attributable to equity
      holders after excluding all items of a nontrading nature divided by the weighted average number
      of ordinary shares in issue during the year
      the presentation of headline earnings is not an ifrs requirement but is required by the jse limited

             with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold
            the amount of revenue can be measured reliably
            it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the group
             and
            the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably
      when the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated reliably
      revenue associated with the transaction is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of
      the transaction at the end of the reporting period the outcome of a transaction can be estimated
      reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied
            the amount of revenue can be measured reliably
            it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the group
            the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period can be measured
             reliably and
            the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be
             measured reliably
      revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the

       116 cost of sales
            when inventories are sold the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense in
            the period in which the related revenue is recognised the amount of any writedown of inventories
            to net realisable value and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period the
            writedown or loss occurs the amount of any reversal of any writedown of inventories arising
            from an increase in net realisable value is recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories

            the related cost of providing services recognised as revenue in the current period is included in cost
            of sales
       117 borrowing costs
            borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of a
            qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset until such time as the asset is ready for
            its intended use the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation is determined as follows
                 actual borrowing costs on funds specifically borrowed for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying
                  asset less any temporary investment of those borrowings
                 weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the entity on funds generally borrowed
                  for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset the borrowing costs capitalised do not exceed
                  the total borrowing costs incurred
            the capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when
                 expenditures for the asset have occurred
                 borrowing costs have been incurred and
                 activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress
            capitalisation is suspended during extended periods in which active development is interrupted
            capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for
            its intended use or sale are complete
            all other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred
       118 translation of foreign currencies
            foreign currency transactions

            at the date of the transaction
            at the end of the reporting period
                 foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate
                 nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
                  translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and
                 nonmonetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using
                  the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined
            exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items
            at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period
            or in previous annual financial statements are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they
            arise
            when a gain or loss on a nonmonetary item is recognised to other comprehensive income and
            accumulated in equity any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised to other
            comprehensive income and accumulated in equity when a gain or loss on a nonmonetary item is
            recognised in profit or loss any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in profit or

       ifrs 8 requires an entity to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable segments
       which are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specific criterias
       operating segments are components of an entity about which separate financial information is
       available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker
       therefore the group determines and presents its operating segments based on the information that
       is internally provided to the chief executive officer who is the chief operating decision maker
       furthermore a segment is a distinguishable component of the group that is engaged either in
       providing related products or services business segment in providing products or services within a
       particular economic environment geographical segment which is subject to risks and returns that
       are different from those of the other segments

                amendments require additional disclosure on transfer transactions of financial assets including the
                possible effects of any residual risks that the transferring entity retains the amendments also require
                additional disclosures if a disproportionate amount of transfer transactions are undertaken around
                the end of a reporting period
                the effective date of the amendment is for years beginning on or after 1 july 2011 respectively
                the group adopted certain of the amendments for the first time in the 2013 annual financial statements
                the impact of the standard is not material
                ias 12 income taxes amendment deferred tax recovery of underlying assets
                the amendment now provides that for investment property measured at fair value the recovery of
                the carrying amount is assumed to be through sale with the result that deferred tax arising on the
                valuation is measured using the prevailing tax rate for capital gains
                the effective date of the amendment is for years beginning on or after 01 january 2012
                the group adopted the standard for the first time in the 2013 annual financial statements

                and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities the following are main changes from ias 39
                     financial assets will be categorised as those subsequently measured at fair value or at
                      amortised cost
                     financial assets at amortised cost are those financial assets where the business model
                      for managing the assets is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows where the
                      contractual cash flows represent payments of principal and interest only all other financial
                      assets are to be subsequently measured at fair value
                     under certain circumstances financial assets may be designated as at fair value
                     for hybrid contracts where the host contract is an asset within the scope of ifrs 9 then the
                      whole instrument is classified in accordance with ifrs 9 without separation of the embedded
                      derivative in other circumstances the provisions of ias 39 still apply
                     voluntary reclassification of financial assets is prohibited financial assets shall be reclassified
                      if the entity changes its business model for the management of financial assets in such
                      circumstances reclassification takes place prospectively from the beginning of the first
                      reporting period after the date of change of the business model
                     financial liabilities shall not be reclassified
                     investments in equity instruments may be measured at fair value through other comprehensive
                      income when such an election is made it may not subsequently be revoked and gains or losses
                      accumulated in equity are not recycled to profit or loss on derecognition of the investment
                      the election may be made per individual investment
                     ifrs 9 does not allow for investments in equity instruments to be measured at cost

        credit quality of other financial assets
        the credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to
        historical information about counterparty default rates and therefore is assessed as medium the medium
        risk is attributable to the risk that some of the loans might not be recoverable over the long term due to
        the tough economic environment and due to students who are low income employees that pay off their
        loans over a longer period the risks are however addressed on a regular basis and if necessary provisions
        for bad debt will be created
