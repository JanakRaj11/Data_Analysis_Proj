     country with nearly 76  of entire supplies catering to                                      manufacturing base despite increased growth in other
     power u of the country 100 thermal power stations in                                      sources coal will remain the major source of electricity
     the country receive coal from coal india for achieving                                      generation in indias energy sector coal accounts for

          utilisation of abandoned mine water cils step towards water conservation

   the rerouting of pure water garnered from the mining practiced which has to skin the sub surface water table is something that
   we are committed towards making this water portable is a matter of creating water harvesting reservoirs and other means
   through which the local communities may fulﬁl their needs the importance of water conservation has been recognised by cil
   which takes pride in being an environmentally responsible company this is also a factor that spells coexistence for us the
   organisation is aware of the fact that water from the abandoned sites need to be used for the mining process as a part of its
   operations in order to harness this source cil has taken up task of holding the mine water into the water bodies by restricting
   them to ﬂow into the natural drainage course like village reservoirs which dry up during the scorching summers this is done by
   laying out a pipeline network of approximately 45 kilometres

   present status two reservoirs have been constructed at khonathi and behrakudar villages of baghmara block of dhanbad
   district with an objective of harnessing mine water for its gainful multipurpose utilisation in the peripheral villages of the bccl
   command area with help of this scheme approximately 47 million gallon surplus mine water is presently being discharged into
   natural water courses from the mines of barora blockii and govindpur areas of bccl this water will be stored in these newly
   constructed reservoirs

   beneﬁciaries residents who own cultivation ﬁelds within a reasonable proximity will be beneﬁted in when it comes to carrying
   out their agricultural works in all seasons these ﬁelds are currently dependent on rain water in monsoon under this scheme
   things are bound to change the provision aims at enhancing the socioeconomic status of the area to increase employment
   the water can be used for multipurpose activities including drinking after proper treatment in these reservoirs pisciculture
   can also be practiced with shgs to increase the livelihood generation opportunities

   the coexitence concept has been extended to accommodate the needs of the biodiversity in the most basic manner with our
   initiatives water management work is being undertaken at the achanakmar tiger reserve which is situated at mere 60
   kilometres from bilaspur in chattisgarh this area enjoys a scenic area of 914 sqkm partly tropical moist and partly deciduous
   with a tropical dry deciduous forest achanakmar tr houses more than 6 of the worlds wild tigers and is a part of the critical
   central indian tiger landscape it also houses over 600 species of medicinal plants along with sal bija saja haldu teaktinsa
   dhawara lendia and khamar among many others the meandering maniyari river that ﬂows right through the heart of the
   reserve is its lifeline given its congenial setting the wild fauna found here includes tigers leopards bisons ﬂying squirrels
   indian giant squirrels chinkaras wild dogs hyenas sambars chitals and over 150 species of birds

   during the summer months the climate tends to get hot and dry with maximum temperatures hitting 45 c owing to these
   high temperatures there is an acute shortage of drinking water in the nearby water resources which has an impact on the
   wildlife of tiger sanctuary this phenomenon forces the wild animals to undertake a lot of travel in order to quench their thirst
   secl and cg forest department have intervened to solve this problem of water shortage as far as the water resources go by
   coming up with a water management plan this plan includes the construction of three stop dams at achanakmar tiger reserve
   which will provide water to the animals even during the dreaded summer

with a commitment towards restoration of abandoned and
mined out areas within a socially acceptable and eco friendly
structure cmpdi has prepared 37 mine closure plans for cil
mines during this reporting year this has been done in keeping
with the revised guidelines issued by ministry of coal moc in
2013 quick comments on 28 mine closure plans for coal blocks
sent by the moc were also prepared and sent to the moc during
the year a mine closure plan is an integral part of the project
report prepared by cmpdil for coalmines which usually follows
the exhaustion of reserves within a mine this progressive mine
closure plan also forms a part of the eia and emp prepared for
submission to the moef for environmental clearance the
progressive reclamation of mined out areas is built into the
project cost and implemented accordingly statutory
obligations in respect of closure are also followed once the
reserves have been exhausted the graph shows the approved

         promoting eco toursim an inovative approach of wcl
     imagine a fountain in a park  and now imagine all these beautiful surroundings created from the use of reclaimed natural
     elements that is the beauty of this next initiative an initiative close to our heart is the one taken by wcl called eco tourism
     this initiative aims at creating awareness amongst citizens regarding coal mining operations environment and development
     an eco friendly mine tourist circuit has been developed which was subsequently launched by the honble minister of coal the
     foundation stone for the development of the ecopark at saoner in nagpur area was laid on the 22nd of march 2015 eco mine
     tours started its operations in november 2015 from zero mile nagpur adasa temple  saoner mine  eco park  gondegaon
     mine  nagpur since then it has seen a bounty of visitors and tourists who come away with lots of valuable insights and
     information




     prime ministers mann ki baat
     the honble prime minster of india revealed his mann kibaat on coal mines on 27th march 2016
     travel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives these days the youth of india are being driven by a spirit of
     adventure and curiosity unlike before they dont want to go to the same old places or tread the oftbeaten track

     they want to do something new see something new i see this as a good sign our youth should be bold they should
     be brave they should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before in this context i would
     like to specially congratulate coal india western coalﬁelds limited at saoner near nagpur where there are coal
     mines which have been developed into an ecofriendly mine tourism circuit

     generally we dont think of coal mines as places to be visited when we see pictures of miners we wonder what it
     must be like out there we even have a saying coal blackens your hands hence people tend to stay away from coal
     mines but western coalﬁelds limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism this is only the
     beginning but already nearly 10000 people have visited this eco friendly minetourism site at saoner near nagpur
     this in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new
