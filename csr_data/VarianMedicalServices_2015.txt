cham training goes paperless
the customer training center at varians european
headquarters in switzerland has gone entirely paperless
which is expected to save more than 70000 sheets of
paper a year

varian trains over 1000 people in the center per annum
with an average of two training sessions each week
taking place in three classrooms at the facility in cham
near zurich each classroom can hold 15 students

technical and clinical software product training materials
are now provided on tablets and attendees can take notes
directly on their tablets using a stylus provided with the
training material after the training they can take their
notes and training material home on a usb stick

this approach saves paper while providing students with
a quick and easy way to store their training materials said
