      nature and scope of the work
      we undertook interviews with about ten people responsible for the preparation of the csr information in the sustainable development and
      environment division industrial safety division and human resources division in charge of the data collection process and if applicable
      the people responsible for internal control processes and risk management in order to
       assess the suitability of the criteria for reporting in relation to their relevance completeness reliability neutrality and understandability
        taking into consideration if relevant industry standards
       verify the implementation of the process for the collection compilation processing and control for completeness and consistency of the
        csr information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the csr information
      we determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the csr information in relation
      to the characteristics of the company its social and environmental issues its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry
      best practices
      for the csr information which we considered the most important 1
       at the level of the consolidated entity and the three segments we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate
        the qualitative information organisation policies actions etc we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and
        verified on a test basis the calculations and the compilation of the information and also verified their coherence and consistency with the
        other information presented in the management report
       at the level of the representative selection of sites that we selected 2 based on their activity their contribution to the consolidated indicators
        their location and a risk analysis we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook detailed tests
        on the basis of samples consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation the sample selected
        therefore represented on average 6 of the total workforce and between 7 and 21 of the environmental information that were considered
        as representative characteristics of the environmental and social domains
      for the other consolidated csr information we assessed their consistency in relation to our knowledge of the company
      finally we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided if appropriate in the partial or total absence of certain information
      we consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgment allow us to
      express a limited assurance conclusion an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive verification work due to the
      necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system the risk
      of nondetection of a significant anomaly in the csr information cannot be entirely eliminated

      conclusion
      based on our work we have not identified any significant misstatement that causes us to believe that the csr information taken together
      has not been fairly presented in compliance with the criteria

      statutory auditors report on the consolidated financial statements




      1 statutory auditors report
         on the consolidated financial statements
      this is a free translation into english of the statutory auditors report on the consolidated financial statements issued in french and it is provided
      solely for the convenience of englishspeaking users the statutory auditors report includes information specifically required by french law in
      such reports whether modified or not this information is presented below the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements and
      includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters these
      assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to
      provide separate assurance on individual account balances transactions or disclosures this report also includes information relating to the
      specific verification of information given in the management report and in the documents addressed to the shareholders this report should be
      read in conjunction with and construed in accordance with french law and professional auditing standards applicable in france
      to the shareholders
      in compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your general annual meeting we hereby report to you for the year ended
      december 31 2016 on
       the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of total sa
       the justification of our assessments
       the specific verification required by law
      these consolidated financial statements have been approved by the board of directors our role is to express an opinion on these
      consolidated financial statements based on our audit

      i opinion on the consolidated financial statements
      we conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in france those standards require that we plan and perform
      the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement an audit
      involves performing procedures using sampling techniques or other methods of selection to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
      disclosures in the consolidated financial statements an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
      the reasonableness of accounting estimates made as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements we believe
      that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion
      in our opinion the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the
      group as at december 31 2016 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with international financial
      reporting standards as adopted by the european union

      ii justification of our assessments
      in accordance with the requirements of article l 8239 of the french commercial code code de commerce relating to the justification of
      our assessments we bring to your attention the following matters
      as stated in the introduction to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph major judgments and accounting estimates some
      accounting principles applied by total sa involve a significant amount of estimates judgments and assumptions management reviews
      these estimates judgments and assumptions on a regular basis if circumstances change or as a result of new information or changes in
      your groups experience different estimates assumptions and judgments could have significant impacts on the consolidated financial
      statements and their notes and consequently the final achievements could also be different from the amounts included in the consolidated
      financial statements these estimates assumptions and judgments relate principally to the application of the successful efforts method for
      the oil and gas activities the valuation of longlived assets the provisions for asset retirement obligations the employee benefits and the
      current and differed tax computation detailed information relating to the application of these accounting principles is given in the notes to
      the consolidated financial statements
      in order to assess the reasonableness of managements estimates we performed audit procedures using sampling techniques that entailed
      the review of the assumptions and calculations on which these estimates are based the comparison of prior years actual results to their
      related estimates and the review of managements process for approving these estimates additionally the introductory note to the financial
      statements was reviewed to ensure that appropriate information regarding the estimates used by management had been disclosed
      in addition regarding the impairment of longlived assets described in note 3d to the consolidated financial statements we reviewed the
      manner in which impairment tests were performed and the key assumptions that led to the determination of recoverable amounts we also
      assessed the sensitivity of the valuation to possible changes in these assumptions and the managements process for approving these estimates
      these audit procedures support our assessment of the reasonableness of these estimates
      these assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and therefore contributed to
      the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report

      iii specific verification
      as required by law we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in france the information related to the
      group presented in the management report
      we have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements

      as a result of the policy for the management of currency exposure previously described the groups sensitivity to currency exposure is
      primarily influenced by the net equity of the subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro and the ruble and to a lesser extent the
      pound sterling the norwegian krone

      this sensitivity is reflected in the historical evolution of the currency translation adjustment recorded in the statement of changes in
      consolidated shareholders equity which over the course of the last three years is essentially related to the fluctuation of the euro the ruble
      and the pound sterling and is set forth in the table below

during its meeting on december 16 2014 the board of directors decided to maintain the seniority vested by mr patrick pouyanné in respect
of his previous salaried positions with the group since january 1 1997

average gross annual compensation fixed and variable over the retirees last three years of employment is taken into account to calculate
the supplementary benefits

the supplementary benefit plan provides beneficiaries with a pension equal to the sum of 18 of the portion of the reference compensation
between eight and 40 times the annual ceiling for calculating french social security contributions and 1 of the reference compensation
between 40 and 60 times the annual ceiling for calculating french social security contributions which is multiplied by the number of years
of employment up to 20 years the assessment basis for this supplementary plan is indexed to changes in the french association for
supplementary pensions schemes arrco index

aggregate supplementary and other pension plan benefits other than those funded personally on a voluntary basis may not exceed 45
of average gross compensation fixed and variable for the last three years of employment in the event that this percentage is exceeded
the supplementary pension is reduced accordingly

at the date of his appointment as chairman and chief executive officer mr patrick pouyanné had served the company for 18 years and
352 days pursuant to the new provisions of article l 225421 of the french commercial code the performance conditions to be defined
by the board of directors may only be taken into account to calculate the chairman and chief executive officers additional pension rights
for one year and 13 days as the current scheme limits the reference period to 20 years

the conditional rights awarded for the period from january 1 1997 to december 18 2015 inclusive correspond to a replacement rate
of 3414 of the portion of compensation that is between eight and 40 times the annual ceiling for calculating french social security
contributions and 1896 of the portion of compensation that is between 40 and 60 times the annual ceiling for calculating french social
security contributions these conditional rights are not subject to performance conditions

the conditional rights awarded to the chairman and chief executive officer for the period from december 19 2015 to december 31 2016
correspond to a maximum replacement rate of 186 of the portion of compensation that is between eight and 40 times the annual ceiling
for calculating french social security contributions and 104 of the portion of compensation that is between 40 and 60 times the annual
ceiling for calculating french social security contributions these additional rights are awarded subject to fulfilment by the chairman and
chief executive officer of a performance condition determined on the basis of the companys financial position

the performance condition is deemed to be fulfilled if the variable portion of the chairman and chief executive officers compensation
paid in 2017 for financial year 2016 is 100 of his base compensation due for financial year 2016 should the variable portion not reach
100 of his base compensation the rights will be awarded on a pro rata basis

during its meeting on february 8 2017 the board of directors noted that the specified performance condition had been fulfilled and
mr patrick pouyanné had additional vested pension rights for the period from december 19 2015 to december 31 2016

the board of directors also noted that mr patrick pouyanné would not be entitled to further pension rights under the plan given the terms
for determining pension rights under the plan and the 20 years of service vested by mr patrick pouyanné at december 31 2016

consequently based on his seniority in the company at december 31 2016 the commitments made by total sa to the chairman
and chief executive officer in terms of supplementary defined benefits and similar pension plans represented a gross annual retirement
pension estimated at 599320 which is 1603 of mr patrick pouyannés gross annual compensation comprising the annual fixed
portion for 2016 1400000 and the variable portion paid in 2017 for financial year 2016 2339400
