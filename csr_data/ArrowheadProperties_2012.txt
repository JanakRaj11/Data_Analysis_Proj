              11     financial instruments


                      financial instruments are contracts that give rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity
                      instrument of another entity

                      financial instruments are recognised on the statement of financial position when the company becomes party
                      to the contractual provisions of the instrument the company initially recognises a financial instrument as a
                      financial asset a financial liability or as an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual
                      arrangement

                      the company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire
                      or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which
                      substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred any interest in transferred
                      financial assets that is created or retained by the entity is recognised as a separate asset or liability

                      expired

                      financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition these
                      instruments are measured as follows


                      financial assets



                         trade and other receivables


                          trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value including transaction costs and are

                          receivables are presented net of an allowance for impairment

                          the allowance for impairment is raised based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivables
                          and the present value of expected future cash flows using the discount rate calculated at initial recognition
                          movements in the provision are recognised in profit or loss unrecoverable amounts are written off against the
                          allowance account subsequent recoveries of previously written off amounts are credited to profit or loss

                          subject to insignificant risk in change in value cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost
                          that approximates fair value

                                                                                arrowhead properties limited annual report 2012   057

111   key estimates and assumptions


       estimates and assumptions an integral part of financial reporting have an impact on the amounts reported for
       the companys assets liabilities income and expenses judgment in these areas is based on historical experience
       and reasonable expectations relating to future events actual results may differ from these estimates information
       on the key estimations and uncertainties that have the most significant effect on amounts recognised are set out
       in the following notes to the financial statements

        accounting policies  notes 12 15 and 16
        investment property valuation  note 2
        impairment of receivables  note 7
        deferred taxation  note 13

       further matters that required key judgments in the preparation of these annual financial statements were

       payment for the acquisition of investment properties

       in the current year the acquisitions of investment properties were treated as property acquisitions in terms of
       ias 40  investment properties in the opinion of the directors these properties did not constitute a business
       as defined in terms of ifrs 3 as there were not adequate processes identified with these properties to warrant
       classification as businesses

       allocation of linked units between stated capital and debentures

       at the date of listing the directors considered the fair value of the debentures to be r 938 the fair value was
       determined based on the expected forward distributions the debentures are recognised as liabilities as there is a
       contractual obligation on the company to deliver cash to the holders in the form of distributions the excess of the
       fair value above the face value of the debentures are recognised as debenture premium and will be recognised in
       profit or loss on a straight line basis over the term of the debentures

       standards and interpretations applicable to the company not yet effective

       there are new or revised accounting standards and interpretations in issue that are not yet effective these
       include the following standards and interpretations that are material to the business and may have an impact on
       future financial statements or those for which the impact has not yet been assessed these standards were not
       early adopted

credit risk


credit risk arises from the risk that a tenant may default or not meet its obligations timeously the financial
position of tenants is monitored on an ongoing basis the risk is minimised as receivables are spread over a wide
customer base allowance is made for specific doubtful debts and credit risk is therefore limited to the carrying
amount of the financial asset at year end

the impairment allowance at 31 september 2012 of r16 million 2011 r nil net of tenant deposits and
guarantees relates to tenants who have either vacated the premises or who have been handed over for non
payment

management does not consider there to be any credit risk exposure that is not already covered in the impairment
the carrying value of receivables is considered to reasonably approximate fair value
