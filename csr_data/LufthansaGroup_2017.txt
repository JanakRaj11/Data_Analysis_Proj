movement continues to be a driving force in the area of the modernization of the lufthansa
groups fleet in 2016 we integrated 47 new aircraft into our groups fleet and this year
we again expect a new aircraft almost every week the current high point of our fleet
renewal is the airbus a350900 the most modern and environmentally friendly longhaul
aircraft in december 2016 we received the first a350 of 25 aircraft on order with the
commissioning of the a320neo at lufthansa and the bombardier c series at swiss there
were even two world premieres during the reporting year but the most important consider
ation is with each new aircraft in operation we reduce our operating costs by 20 percent
and make an important contribution to noise reduction and environmental protection

by having supported the un global compact since 2002 we emphasize our continued
commitment to fulfilling our responsibility for environmental and social issues alongside
economic aspects this also includes continuing to make ongoing contributions to society

from the internet of things via big data to smart homes digitalization is a
megatrend already intelligent and interconnected systems shape our public
and private lives for some time now digitalization has permeated almost
all aspects of aviation with enormous consequences on existing processes
and products the capabilities of information technology offer the lufthansa
group concrete opportunities to further optimize its service value chain to
add digital components to its product and service offers and to personalize
the latter similarly work processes can be simplified and green transfor

of the groups strategic action areas the transformation toward electronically
supported processes is fully underway in all business segments

        how important is digitalization to the lufthansa group                            what advantages will customers reap
        it is the central topic related to innovation and future viability in all          from digital innovation
        business segments of the lufthansa group digitalization is now                    the airlines within the lufthansa group are intensively working on
        changing our lives to an extent that only very few were able to imagine            differentiating and personalizing their offers the goal is as obvious
        a mere ten years ago politics and election campaigns today take                   as it is ambitious we want to increase our customers satisfaction
        place on the social media stage in the same matteroffact way as do               and thus increase their loyalty given that we welcome more than
        dialogues between friends and strangers similarly learning doing                100 million passengers aboard our aircraft every year one question

        we are evaluating all aspects that are related to such a profound                  passengers lounge access to be able to relax or an upgrade to a
        process of change of course the central question is how we can                   higher travel class for the connecting flight
        offer our customers an even more streamlined and more pleasant
        travel experience and which opportunities digitalization offers us in              incidentally personalized service improvements along the travel
        this area digitalization will change the way we interact with our cus            chain contribute to deepening customer relationships and increasing

8    sustainability report balance  issue 2017  lufthansa group  cover story digitalaviation

   how can an aviation company take advantage of electronically
   supported processes to operate in even more sustainable ways
   from an economic perspective there is significant potential the question is how
   digitalization can be harnessed to set up familiar business processes in better and




                                                                                                expert interview
   more efficient ways specifically we are looking at efficiency advantages in dimen
   sions that cannot be realized by means of classic methods of continuous improve
   ment such as lean management or kaizen for example the use of socalled chat
   bots in customer service over the telephone  meaning digital assistants supported
   by artificial intelligence  reduces the workload of our service centers and simultane
   ously shortens waiting times for our customers there are also more concrete
   examples in the spare parts supply chains for our aircraft we use sensors for
   geolocalization and tracking systems for aircraft components often new technol
   ogies provide ecological advantages in addition to economic effects for example
   on its digital platform aviatar lufthansa technik developed a prognostic system
   that allows the continuous optimum trimming of the aileron which in turn significantly
   reduces kerosene consumption and co2 emissions this is no longer a vision of the
   future but a solution used in daily operations equally changing from paperbased to
   digital processes helps us to conserve precious resources along the value chain

   how much influence does digitalization have
   on the lufthansa groups work environment
   our internal structures will change considerably in the future working in networks
   will increasingly gain importance in contrast to classic hierarchical structures net
   works are formed by colleagues who have a particular identification with a topic
   and would like to make a contribution to it a persons hierarchical position or the
   question of organizational affiliation within the lufthansa group becomes secondary
   in this context our digital development teams already work in this manner and this
   highly motivating way of working which is based on enthusiasm and the will to
   participate is set to spread with the network a second legitimate organizational
   element establishes itself in tandem with hierarchy the network with its ostensibly
   looser structure fosters searching experimenting learning and changing as a
   result a more flexible and agile type of organization will evolve




aviatar digital depiction of aircraft and
the mro industry with aviatar the new product division digital
fleet solutions at lufthansa technik headed by dr christian langer is developing a cen
tral internetbased platform that offers customers access to all digital mro solutions
maintenance repair and overhaul it allows airlines to monitor the technical state of
their fleets in real time and make decisions to ensure optimal technical maintenance for
example using integrated forecasting systems predictive maintenance users are able to
search directly for the most suitable spare part and arrange for its shipment to the nearest
maintenance station even before the aircraft component in question has malfunctioned
furthermore all documents required for proof of airworthiness can be called up directly
on aviatar the deliberately open platform invites others  including competitors  to
develop innovative applications and offer them there this new approach aims to signifi
cantly increase the development speed of digital innovations for the mro industry  for
the benefit of airlines and passengers alike

how we shape tomorrows world
       today is decisive
 professor sabine pfeiffer holds a chair in sociology at hohenheim university




                                                                                                                expert interview
 what influence does technological progress have on the
 interactions between people technology and organizations
 technological change has always had a significant influence on people and organizations
 what is new is that 40 technologies need a lot more shaping each company needs to define
 digitalization in highly concrete terms for itself as a result people and organizations now face
 more pronounced challenges concerning the design of technology than before

 what does the work environment 40 look like
 above all confused and not simultaneous many things will develop in different ways but the
 decisive point is how we shape tomorrows world today in shaping the new working environments
 it is important to create jobs that allow for future changes the broader the definition of tasks and
 the more qualified the employees the greater a companys ability to innovate in the future

 and talking about industry 40 what are the requirements that employees
 have to fulfill to be fit for the world of bits and bytes
 employees are much fitter than is commonly assumed one reason for this is that in their private
 lives they are digitally much more active than on their jobs another is that they have gathered
 experience with change due to digitalization and globalization over the past years our research
 shows that a large number of employees today often deal with change complexity and impon
 derables we measure this requirement with an index concerning the working capacity or
 arbeitsvermögen in german av1 in germany 74 percent of employees show an av value
 above average in aviation this value stands at 85 percent and is thus considerably higher
 therefore the employees know how to deal with change  the important point is to involve them
 actively from the beginning

 how can companies best shape corporate sustainability
 in the age of digitalization
 digitalization provides more transparency concerning resource consumption smarter manage
 ment systems for buildings aviation and it technology will make it easier to conserve resources
 however these opportunities have to be taken into account at the design stage of such systems
 this is highly important because digitalization itself is very resourceintensive


    sabine pfeiffer conducts research work on the changes affecting technology and the
    work environment one area of emphasis in her work is the question of what effects
    digitalization has on work situations in 2016 she was appointed to the scientific advisory
    council of the platform industrie 40

how will the lufthansa group further develop its
sustainability strategy
i am convinced that sustainability will increasingly become a
factor for success in global competition as a result stake
holders and management will focus more and more on sus
tainability strategies in many lufthansa group companies we
already have a good setup in this respect the next step is to
continuously evolve groupwide sustainability strategy and to
interlink it even further with group strategy so that we can give
effective companywide steering impulses in this area

strategy and management

on a global scale aviation is a growth industry and will need fossil fuels for an
undetermined period of time among the significant effects of flight operations
are above all climate effects as a result of co2 emissions however for many
years the industry has improved its energy efficiency and thus also its co2
balance sheet despite marked growth rates the share of aviation in world
wide co2 emissions has declined namely from 281 percent in 2000 to 255
percent in 20141



apart from the climaterelated effects there are other environmen       risk management and
tal burdens during takeoff and landing aircraft cause noise close
to airports and have an influence on local air quality in addition
                                                                          organizational structures
upstream and downstream activities consume resources such as
energy and water and produce waste materials in particular in           the entrepreneurial risks associated with climate change and
airline catering and aircraft maintenance                                noise tie the lufthansa group into a multidisciplinary company

focuses its commitment above all on the product of flying and           2020 environmental programs and environmental management
therefore on co2 emissions and aircraft noise the group has set          systems among others see page 35

fuel consumption and emissions

the lufthansa group maintains its specific fuel consumption at a low level
in 2016 the aircraft in the passenger fleets needed 385 liters of kerosene
on average to transport one passenger over a distance of 100 kilometers
the efficiency record achieved in the two preceding years was a mere
001 liters lower



the lufthansa groups absolute fuel consumption increased by                           from leisure travelers on longhaul routes from asia and north
12 percent compared with the previous year for many years the                       america to europe especially in the second and third quarters
aviation group has successfully decoupled transport performance                        similarly strikes that were threatened and strikes conducted in
