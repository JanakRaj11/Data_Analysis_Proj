      for loans and receivables the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present                   results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset for example inventory or fixed assets the gains and losses previously deferred in
      value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets                 equity are reclassified from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset the deferred amounts are ultimately

      if a loan or heldtomaturity investment has a variable interest rate the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current

      occurring after the impairment was recognised such as an improvement in the debtors credit rating the reversal of the previously
      recognised impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss                                                                                           net investment hedges
