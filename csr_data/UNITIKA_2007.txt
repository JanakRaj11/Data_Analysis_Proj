                      environmental problems
                  problems that face all humanity
     unitika created its environmental preservation                 from one of the spinning mills in our business chain and
     regulations in 1973 to enable a selfdirected                   a problem with the water from a dyeing plant so we
     approach to work on the environment                           started with the issue of how to make the emissions from
                                                                     our own plants as harmless as possible our objective as a
        konno when did unitika start its csr activities            manufacturer was to switch to an environmentally aware
        ohnishi we first started working on the environment         corporate culture free from harmful waste emissions
     in the midsixties inspired by a series of pollution           were now expanding the scope of our environmental
     problems caused by japans high overall growth then in         activities we act as a focal point of technologies selling
     1973 we created our own set of environmental                    the technologies refined during product development at
     preservation regulations we strongly believed that             our plants as systems for external buyers we have also
     environmental problems would become major issues                established environmentally aware business units that
     affecting the planet for this reason we wanted to work        discover problem areas through various types of analysis
     on them through our own selfdirected approach instead             konno specifically what activities have you worked
     of just passively meeting obligations imposed by outside        on to switch to an environmentally aware corporate
     authoritiesmandatory numerical targetsand leaving it at       culture
     that today the 21st century is being called the century          ohnishi for example in 2004 we started operating a
     of the environment and those of us in the corporate            gas cogeneration system fueled by natural gas at our uji
     world are being called on to engage in environmentally          plant the fuel oil that once powered the plants boilers
     aware management                                               and generated electricity has been replaced by natural
        konno i agree that measures to combat                       gas generating electricity and steam and creating more
     environmental problems should involve more than just            costeffective power carbon dioxide emissions a large
     vying to meet numerical targets i think corporations and       cause of environmental problems have been reduced by
     consumers both need to take a selfdirected approach            30 to 40 while dust and sulfur oxide emissions have
     toward working on the environment                              been reduced by half a similar system is now operating
        ohnishi when we started our work on the                     at our okazaki plant and we plan to start installing these
     environment we had a problem with emissions gases              systems at other production sites

 rigorous quality standards are important in                       component elements and a defect in any of them could
 manufacturing even for small parts                              lead to the failure of the entire product so no matter
                                                                    how small it may be each of our parts is manufactured
    konno with unitikas many plants in regions                    under rigorous quality controls
 throughout japan how do you educate all your
 employees about unitikas csr philosophy                          it would be good if plastic supermarket bags
    ohnishi we have created an organization called the             and other disposable plastic items were all made
 compliance committee its part of an airtight system              of terramac
 comprised of our environment committee central
 safety and sanitation committee a higherlevel                       konno when i
 committee chaired by myself as well as directors                 looked at the unitika
 executive officers department heads and other relevant           web site i was
 employees these organizations focus primarily on                  surprised to see the
 internal control and have been responsible for                    wide range of
 environmental initiatives such as promoting iso 14001              business areas
 certification the iso standard for environmental                  unitika is now
 compliance among unitika sites and affiliates nine of            involved inmany
 our domestic research and production sites and twelve             more than when i
 of our affiliates are iso 14001certified while our overall       was the unitika
 iso coverage is pretty much complete we want more                 mascot girl
 sites to become certified                                            ohnishi personally i think there are still many areas
    konno today food safety and the environment are               were not involved in that we should be corporate value
 areas where a single minute problem tends to result in             is determined by how often a company can create
 widespread media attention dealing with crisis                    innovative concepts that embody its corporate
 management issues must be a major effort for corporate             philosophy and since today the trend is toward
 top management                                                    increasing concern for the environment and consumer
    ohnishi yes it certainly is the products we                  safety corporations have to take on greater
 manufacture are materials used for a wide range of                 responsibility in these areas because just publicizing
 applicationswhether theyre food packaging products or           various types of complex environmental care isnt
 materials used in products ranging from vehicles to                enough to completely eliminate consumers concerns
 mobile phones while we arent often called upon                   about pollution more basic solutions are required for
 directly to answer concerns over potential dangers to              example terramac is a recyclable material made by
 consumers the products we manufacture pass into the               unitika by polymerizing corn into a polylactic acid it is
 hands of consumers so we take our responsibility very             used in applications such as a resin for plastic products
 seriously and set rigorous product standards                      as a clothing fiber and as a spunbond nonwoven fabric
 manufacturing a single product involves a number of                it can also be used in petroleumbased films

   konno its interesting that terramac is made from               ohnishi ive heard that in china people are forced to
corn a food resource do you use imported corn                 drink water they know is polluted as part of our efforts
   ohnishi while terramac is made from corn its just          to create an environmentally aware business weve had a
the starch thats needed as youre no doubt aware a lot        successful track record of providing water treatment
of corn is harvested in the us for use as livestock feed        technology to china and since japan is importing more
we dont import the corn itself first the corn is turned        and more food the water used to cultivate or raise that
into starch then sugar then its imported as a fermented       food is effectively being used by japan
polylactic acid                                                    konno ive heard that importing grain is the same as
   konno supermarket plastic bags have recently                 importing the water used overseas i hope unitikas
become a widely covered environmental issue in japan i          technologies will spread to other developing countries
think it would be good if disposable plastic items like          besides china
that were all made of terramac would it be
economically feasible                                           because japan generated such a lot of
   ohnishi one area were working on now is getting             environmentally harmful pollution i think it has a
municipalities in japan to switch the garbage bags they          duty to play a leading role in providing
distribute to terramac bags while i think theyll cost          guidance
more than conventional garbage bags i think people are
going to become more aware of the                                                      ohnishi human economic activity is
costs needed for environmental                                                      ultimately a destructive activity i think
preservation                                                                       this destruction has accumulated over
                                                                                    the years and has led to the global
unitika has a successful track                                                     environmental problems we have
record of providing water                                                           today the problem may be that we
treatment technology to china                                                     dont feel the need to worry about
                                                                                    today tomorrow or the next day but if
   ohnishi what type of work do you                                                todays problems continue unabated
do in your role as goodwill ambassador                                              the consequences will be severe
for the united nations development                                                     konno but the un is working to
programme                                                                          prevent that happening and because
   konno once a year i observe un                                                  japan generated such a lot of
development programme projects in                                                   environmentally harmful pollution
developing countries so that i can help publicize that          during its high growth era i think it has a duty to play a
work in august this year i went to cambodia cambodia           leading role in providing guidance so that neighboring
rivals vietnam in the speed of its growth and is                developing countries dont make the same mistake i
becoming more developed every year the capital city of          hope japanese technologies can be put to greater use in
phnom penh and siem reap where angkor wat is                    developing countries
located are extremely lively areas with new buildings             ohnishi absolutely instead of competing for
going up in rapid succession i had actually visited the         international dominance or worrying about the balance
country once before in 1999 and was amazed to see how           of international power japan needs to put its
greatly it had changed in just the few years since then         energysaving and environmental solutions technologies
but if you go to the less populated areas nothing has           to greater use among developing countries the
changed just as in most developing countries theres a         problems are not just environmental food shortages
huge difference between the urban and rural areas               caused by population growth are going to become more
naturally few rural homes have electricity or gas and          serious these problems are not just problems for
many people dont even have safe access to waterthe             corporations to work on but problems that face all
most crucial requirement for human life east timor              humanity nations are going to need to deepen their
faces a slightly different set of problems it has natural       understanding of each other and learn how to coexist
resources planning and funding but lacks the                   while promoting civilized use of limited resources
manpower to provide leadership i wonder if unitikas
technology could be used to help developing asian
countries like these

 logistics
to reduce the environmental impact of transportation needed for inputs of raw materials and outputs of products and waste products
unitika implements the four logistic guidelines shown below these guidelines have helped us make acrosstheboard improvements in
transportation efficiency and in reducing energy consumption and emissions gases



          we will shorten transport distances by lending borrowing or swapping generaluse products or materials of equal quality with other companies

          within japan we will use container transport by sea or rail whenever possible since these methods enable mass transport and are energyefficient

          forklifts used for work inside sites will be changed from enginedriven models to environmentallyfriendly batterydriven models with zero emissions
          gases and low noise

          we will reduce transportation energy consumption by using flexible containers that can wrap larger numbers of products instead of paper bag
          wrapping materials and by shaping containers for more efficient truck loading




in line with an april 2006 revision to japans laws pertaining to rationalized energy consumption we have started energysaving initiatives
for logistic
in fy 2006 unitika and unitika group companies were registered as the designated shippers for a total freight transport volume of
107654 thousand tonkm resulting in a co2 emissions volume of 36 thousand tons tco2
