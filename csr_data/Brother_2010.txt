facetoface talk  striving to become a truly global company




in 2010 brother started to work on a new challenge to become a truly global company brother
industries president toshikazu koike invited ms misako konno undp goodwill ambassador to discuss
brothers csr management



a truly global company in business operations as deﬁned by brother
konno i heard that brother considers 2010 to be the ﬁrst year of globalization and will commit
itself to becoming a truly global company brother already operates in more than 40 countries and
regions so why is it important to focus on globalization now

koike youre right that brother is a global company in the sense that it has facilities around the
world and more than 80 of its sales come from outside japan however brother is determined to
prosper forever so we have many more challenges to face

konno what challenges do you mean

koike it is necessary to unleash the full potential of facilities outside japan throughout the
manufacturing process such as development production and marketing for example in
development products such as printers multifunction centers fax machines sewing machines and
machine tools are developed and designed by engineers in japan but we want to create a system
whereby facilities outside japan including those in china can also design these products so in
july this year we set up brother software development hangzhou ltd for developing software
which will start operations in october

                                                                             the middle east to develop those markets

                                                                             konno what will the brother groups facilities in
                                                                             japan do

koike we want facilities in japan to focus on new challenges so we will build a framework in which
development and manufacturing facilities outside japan handle on their own the manufacturing of
certain products that are released in a series meanwhile employees in japan will increasingly be tasked
with creating innovative products and technologies they will be under pressure but will ﬁnd their jobs
more productive and worthwhile

we also believe that new core businesses need to be established in japan to sustain the groups
growth for example xing inc which is a brother subsidiary in the online karaoke business acquired
bmb corporation another karaoke company xing inc started under a new organization on july 1
2010 and to expand it will oﬀer not just karaoke music but also new services taking advantage of
contents and network technologies


brother group global charter  cornerstone of csr management

konno the fact that your group has people from
diﬀerent countries and regions with diverse cultures
and customs must cause some diﬃculties

koike it certainly does to prevent people heading oﬀ
in diﬀerent directions brother established the brother
group global charter which sets out basic policies
and codes of practice to govern decisionmaking
and implementation by group companies and
employees the basic policies also cover the
relationship with stakeholders including customers in
fact the global charter is the cornerstone of
brothers csr management we have created
portable businesscardsized booklets called handy
size version of the global charter booklets which all
employees carry while at work

facetoface talk  striving to become a truly global company


konno does that include everyone outside japan

koike yes the global charter has been translated into 26 languages so that all our employees can
understand it and weve created various training programs around the world to instill the message
these programs have been attended by over 6000 employees to date and surveys conducted annually
since three years ago show that the global charter is increasingly accepted by employees

we will follow this charter to promote csr management globally establish brother as a reliable brand
and grow into a company that leads a strong sense of pride among employees

globalizing human assets  active communications across national borders

koike to be a truly global company all brother group employees must become more aware and
internationallyminded businesspeople ideally we want to work openly with employees regardless of
nationality race gender and language it will take time but we can achieve it through steady eﬀorts and so
were keen to recruit foreign nationals and promote communications among employees in the group

facetoface talk  striving to become a truly global company


for example in our trainee programs local employees working at facilities outside japan are invited to
japan to work with japanese employees and learn many things during 6 to 12 months meanwhile young
japanese employees are sent to group companies outside japan to acquire expertise and improve their
language skills foreign nationals are being recruited in japan in everlarger numbers last year we recruited
about 20 foreigners fresh from university and graduate school three months after joining brother
employees who could not speak japanese at all wrote to me in japanese starting with dear terrysan
 terry is koikes nickname that was given to him when he worked in the us
  today koike is known by this nickname in the group as a token of his friendliness



konno you closely communicate with
employees

koike yes and i also take time to write to
employees via the intranet in two ways first
message from terry informs employees of
my daytoday work thereby sharing brothers
management vision and the brother dna
these messages are translated into eight
languages and recently i started publishing
video messages as well second terrys
tsurezure diary publicizes my private
activities in june the total number of entries
over the past ﬁve years or so reached 400
which means that i post on my blog about 80
times a year

konno i gather that employees look forward to the updates

koike yes i get that impression im now posting about 15 articles in total every month for message
from terry and terrys tsurezure diary which involves a lot of work i post new articles on speciﬁc
days of the week but when the websites are not updated on schedule i get complaints like why
didnt you post a new article today we were delighted when brother industries appeared on the
2010 list of one of the 25 best workplaces in japan by the great place to work institute japan
apparently the list which started in 2007 recognizes companies where employees trust the people
they work for have pride in what they do and enjoy the people they work with i think my eﬀorts to
communicate have paid oﬀ i want to actively communicate with employees and build a solid lasting
relationship based on trust

contributing to local communities as a good corporate citizen
konno i travel to many countries as a undp goodwill ambassador and have found that poverty is a big
challenge in developing countries some of these countries have governmentrun sewing factories to
create jobs they have a system whereby citizens attend training programs to learn how to use sewing
machines acquire sewing skills and earn income jobs give people hope and optimism in their work

koike looking back on japans history the sewing industry was a pioneering sector in the
industrialization process and thus sewing machines can play a signiﬁcant role as you said prospective
users of industrial sewing machines need to acquire skills and so they need training programs to learn
how to use sewing machines as a manufacturer and seller of industrial sewing machines and machine
tools brother oﬀers technical training and education programs to its customers about how to produce
neat stitches with sewing machines and eﬃcient ways to process parts with machine tools in particular
we have worked with the association for overseas technical scholarship for more than 15 years to
develop such support programs in fy 2009 we organized seminars for production managers at sewing
factories in bangladesh and india

whether their internal control systems are functioning eﬀectively and internal auditing departments
conduct audits from an independent viewpoint any matter to be improved as found in an audit was
actually improved by the end of the relevant ﬁscal year and an internal control report that includes the

developing products with customers first in mind


increasing the scope of applications and enhancing
 the convenience of label printers
analyzing information from customers viewpoint discovering potential needs
and reﬂecting them in products
brothers label printers were ﬁrst released in 1988
under the ptouch brand and have continued to evolve
ever since with input from customers the ptouch
series oﬀers a convenient solution for printing
laminated tape labels to put names on stationery show
titles on ﬁles and cds or identify parts and cables

the ptouch series was popular in the global market
because brother was quick to meet the needs of
customers in europe and the us where typewriters
were commonly used by employing a keyboard system
to enter letters this was made possible by brothers
capabilities to apply technologies used in typewriters
and word processors and quickly match products to
market needs

brother industries remains committed to developing
products from the customers viewpoint and so the                            ptouch a convenient label printing tool used in
                                                                              various applications at home and in oﬃces
product planning department which handles label
printers conducts periodic customer surveys on the purchase motivation status of use satisfaction
levels and needs of customers the survey results are then used to determine the performance design
and price and introduce applications of label printers



feedback from customers leads to no installation required
and highspeed printing features
some models of the ptouch series can be
connected to a pc via a usb cable so that users can
enter letters and create various designs by using
editing software
in earlier models editing software was provided on a
cd included in the package so users had to install
the software in their pc customer satisfaction
surveys revealed however that customers found it
                                                                              ptouch 2430pc the editing screen appears on the display
troublesome to install the software or that                                  without installing software in the pc
corporate customers could not install it on their
oﬃce pcs due to strict security control

developing products with customers first in mind


to overcome such inconvenience brother developed
the ptouch 2430pc a label printer with builtin
editing software the label printer can be connected
to a pc via a usb cable and software can be readily
started without installation for editing and printing
for windows os only for macintosh os software
must be installed from the cd included in the
package the product has been popular in the
japanese market since its launch in february 2009

customer satisfaction surveys also found that
customers who use ptouch products at                                         ptouch 9800pcn oﬀers four times faster printing than
                                                                              the conventional model
manufacturing sites to print rating plates and
barcode labels for product names production
numbers etc in bulk do not like having to wait for
the labels to be printed or having to take printed labels from the oﬃce to the production line

this customer feedback led to the development of two models of the ptouch i the ptouch 9700pc
featuring a highspeed printing mode 80 mmsec eight times faster than ptouch 2430pc and a
distributed printing function capable of printing via two or more ptouch units and ii the ptouch
9800pcn brothers ﬁrst label printer with a builtin network function which can be installed near
production lines that are not suitable for pcs these label printers for industrial use help customers
create labels at low cost increase production eﬃciency and reduce manhours

because label printers are used in various applications the product planning department stays alert to
new developments conducts market surveys and observations from the viewpoint of customers to
explore emerging new applications and enhances the functionality of products




electronic paper terminals for carrying a large volume of information
 conveniently and safely
developing document viewer the third document reading tool
it is convenient if a large volume of information such as sales documents aftersales service manuals
and other technical data is available outside the oﬃce hardcopies are bulky and incur the risk of
information leakage due to loss or theft whereas the displays of mobile pcs and palmsized pcs are too
small to be easily readable
if operation methods and troubleshooting options are readily available on the qa pages customers
can save time by not having to contact our call center we therefore analyzed in detail how the qa
pages on the japanese website are used so that we could review or add information to brother
solutions center

lets develop an electronic paper terminal that has a
large 97inch screen weighs about 600 g can store
data equivalent to 10000 sheets of a4 size is as easy
to read as printed paper and enables users to view
documents just like ﬂipping pages this product will
reduce environmental impact by cutting paper and ink
consumption and avoid the risk of information                                  brother document viewer an electronic paper terminal

leakage by data encryption this is the third document
viewing tool following paper and pcs and is diﬀerent
from ebooks which are based on a business model of
selling the terminal and then distributing contents

this product is also designed to help customers
signiﬁcantly reduce the electric power and paper

focusing on a display that oﬀers excellent readability a fast pageﬂipping function
and long hours of operation

in addition to data storage capacity equivalent to
10000 sheets of a4 size brother engineers worked
to achieve user friendliness being insistent on three
requirements i a display that oﬀers excellent
readability ii a fast pageﬂipping function and iii
long hours of operation

the display size was set to 97 inches 2028 mm x
1394 mm so that small letters and drawings can be
viewed easily it was also decided to use an                                  runs for about 83 hours on batteries and can be read

developing products with customers first in mind


to overcome these problems the nid research 
development department1 of brother industries drew up
a plan to commercialize an innovative electronic terminal

the product was also designed to start up within ﬁve
seconds after turning on the power while ﬂipping the
page within one second as convenient as an ordinary
book the batteries were designed to last continuously
for 83 hours displaying 5000 pages without worrying
about the power source a password lock function was                                  there is no need for printing even when document data is
added to allow access only by authorized users data                                  updated or revised added information can be transmitted
                                                                                      via smart phones and magniﬁed on document viewer

one designer engaged in product development commented as follows
lets say that we improve a product to enhance userfriendliness for
individuals with disabilities in one arm or hand this improvement will
produce functions which enable individuals without disabilities to easily
use the product with one hand for example a product which is
designed for individuals in wheelchairs can be operated smoothly by
other individuals while sitting in chairs this is how we embody
userfriendliness for customers in general not for speciﬁc groups of          development and use of fonts which
                                                                               can be easily read by elderly people

oﬀering usercentered design training programs for new employees of
brother industries and brother sales
the design division of brother industries
used to oﬀer usercentered design
training programs only to new employees
of its own division since fy 2009
however all new employees of brother
industries and brother sales have been
required to join these training programs
                                                                         employees in a training session wearing a special kit to simulate using products
this is part of brothers eﬀorts to make                                 while under sensory deprivation as suﬀered by elderly people

new employees aware of the importance
of broadening the scope of customers
who can use products and the value of developing products that are easy for customers to operate and
understand thereby allowing them to use this awareness in diﬀerent job domains

in 2009 180 new employees both technical and administrative staﬀ and in 2010 71 new employees
including graduates of universities abroad attended the training programs from april to may in which
they learned the basics of usercentered design and universal design evaluated the ease of use and
participated in demonstrations to simulate sensory deprivation using a special kit which elderly people
go through the participants experienced how the age ability and literacy of users cause diﬀerences in
ease of understanding and operation

the employees who worked on sensory deprivation simulations and easeofoperation evaluations were
amazed at how hard it becomes for elderly people to use products depending on the font size or switch
position and therefore it is necessary to fully understand the diﬀerences in awareness between
designers and users

the brother group will continue to upgrade these training programs and promote manufacturing of
products which are friendly to more customers

minimizing product returns and servicing rate


based on brotherʼs unique concept from the viewpoint of customers
eﬀorts to minimize the number of returns after shipment
at the brother group the percentage of products returned from customers for repair or return is
deﬁned as product returns and servicing rate we believe that the time and eﬀort suﬀered by
customers due to trouble with the products no matter how small is an inconvenience for them
the brother group believes that reducing the number of returned products close to zero should be
placed above all others to achieve greater customer satisfaction and together with all departments
from development design manufacture logistics sales to services we promote the acrosstheboard
activity to pursue improvement of products quality

 customer satisfaction
all facilities and departments working together china
machinery and solution business ms business
which handles industrial sewing machines of the
brother group has been focusing on quality
improvement activities involving manufacturing
facilities under the leadership of brother china a
sales facility for industrial sewing machines in china
the activities are intended to reduce defects and
failures of products thereby decreasing product
returns and servicing rate
                                                                              single needle direct drive straight lock stitcher s7200c
a defect in an industrial sewing machine would
signiﬁcantly aﬀect production at the sewing factories
of our customers the sewing industry in china is facing various challenges such as declining exports as
well as surging costs of raw materials and labor and our customers urgently need to increase the
operating rate of their sewing machines and enhance productivity brotherʼs responsibility is to minimize
defects and failures of sewing machines close to zero so that customers can operate them without
interruption

to this end each manufacturing facility analyzes quality data in depth every month while diﬀerent
departments share problems and countermeasures in order to make improvements in fact facilities
and departments work closely with each other in many areas including i conducting rigorous tests
beyond ordinary evaluation standards ii checking performance by monitoring the market iii
identifying causes of defects and taking thorough measures to prevent recurrence and iv providing
skills training programs and creating a knowledge database on troubleshooting these eﬀorts have
steadily increased the awareness of all employees and as a result the results of reducing product
returns and servicing rate for six main models surpassed our targets as of december 2009 ms
business will share the results of this activity with brother facilities in india and bangladesh to raise the
value of industrial sewing machines

when product defects are reported to call centers
or when products returned from customers reveal
manufacturing quality problems improvement
measures should be taken not just for the speciﬁc
models in question but also for other models as
soon as possible to guarantee product quality and
enhance customer satisfaction

introduced a framework to take improvement
measures for all product models within 24 hours
after a problem is identiﬁed thereby preventing
similar problems

the crux of this eﬀort is to establish programs and
ensure quick action in fy 2009 btsl gave priority
to why why analysis in which questions are asked
repeatedly as to why problems arose and
developing eﬀective measures for preventing
recurrence these improvements have been
documented in manuals work procedures
meanwhile btsl has been stepping up its eﬀorts to
take preventive measures and applying them to                                 checking how improvement measures are applied

improving search performance on the japanese website
in november 2009 brother sales ltd our sales
facility in japan launched a new customer support
system brother support navi 24 which is a
dialoguestyle question  answer system on the web
to respond customers inquiries on our products

if operation methods and troubleshooting options
are readily available on the qa pages customers
can save time by not having to contact our call
center we therefore analyzed in detail how the qa
pages on the japanese website are used so that we
could review or add information to brother solutions
center                                                                       improved search performance on qa pages


in fy 2009 we doubled the chance of customers
ﬁnding a solution on the pages upon entering a question in the search box thus making the service
more reliable for customers we will continue to review the system to improve search performance




faster response times for websites in other languages
brother solutions center must immediately oﬀer
solutions when customers need help so in fy 2009
we upgraded the system to reduce the response
times for websites in languages other than japanese

as a result the time required to display the qa top
page and to download software or manuals has been
more than halved for almost all countries and
regions the page exit ratios due to slow response
have been reduced by 40 and the number of
downloads has increased

these improvements have steadily reduced the
number of calls to the call center or the time spent
by customers talking to operators while looking at
webpages                                                                     signiﬁcantly speeding up page display times

promoting employment and support for persons with disabilities
in germany france and japan businesses are obliged to hire a certain percentage of persons with
disabilities by laws and regulations for example japanese law stipulates that businesses of a certain
size and larger must ﬁll a minimum of 18 of the total workforce with disabled persons though there
is no legal employment rate in china on the employment of persons with disabilities there are some
local governments that provide ﬁnancial assistance for hiring disabled persons the brother group is
hiring persons with physical disabilities according to the situations in each of these countries and
regions
the employment rate of disabled persons by brother industries ltd bil in fy2009 exceeded the legal
minimum at 207 and those employees are engaged actively in positions assigned in accordance with
their qualiﬁcations and performances

                                 employment rate of disabled persons brother industries ltd




in fy 2009 eﬀorts were made to improve the workplace environment so that employees whether
handicapped or not can deepen mutual understanding work in closer coordination and take full
advantage of their capabilities

in administrative departments of brother industries where many hearinghandicapped employees work
facilitating communication among the employees have been a challenge therefore one of the
departments was selected as a model workplace and two hearinghandicapped employees and their
colleaguesmanagers were requested to join a ﬁvepart program including interviews and observation
of sign language classes from october through december

the participants obtained advice from the vocational center for persons with disabilities in aichi
prefecturean organization which oﬀered support to host the programregarding how to organize
meetings in the department sign language groups and workshops to learn more about the
characteristics of disabilities

thanks to commitment by the handicapped employees as well as enthusiastic support by their
colleaguesmanagers this department produced substantial results such as increased work eﬃciency
and smoother communications

using this as a model case the brother group has built an inhouse job coach system to make other
departments more pleasant for employees to work even for those with other handicaps job coaches
are experts in giving impartial advice and guidance to help handicapped individuals with their work


reemploying retirees and supporting their activities
in april 2006 the brother group established the new senior staﬀ ss system to promote
reemployment of individuals who have mandatorily retired this system is designed to enable senior
staﬀ to pass on their rich knowledge and experience to younger employees and to help senior
employees remain motivated in life and get job satisfaction

in the midst of rapid globalization of manufacturing operations senior staﬀ will play an increasingly
important role because of their abilities to coordinate train and mentor younger employees as of fy
2009 almost all about 300 persons of the applicants have been reemployed to fulﬁll assignments in
the group

we will continue to broaden their scope of activities including creation of new tasks so that senior staﬀ
can work with a greater sense of motivation and pride

of how to carry on our corporate culture
referred to as ʻbrothers uniqueness amidst
the sharp increase of young employees and

                                                                         study session of team brother project
satisfaction two years in a row by
implementing exchange meetings and
workplace tours with other departments and this success realized the expansion of the project across
the board as the team brother project


creating a company that employees take pride in being part of
the ultimate goal of the project is to improve the pride of brother employees the project intends to
encourage all employees of brother industries to take initiative rather than to be given by the
company and expects the employees to bring the driving force to make brother a cheerful happy and

managerial positions members attend a regular monthly meeting at their own discretion the meetings
focus on analyzing results of the employee awareness surveys conducted every half year and having a
study session with various subjects such as the global charter mental health brand strategy social

welcoming events for new hires exchange meetings with other departments launch websites to
introduce their departments cleanups around the business sites etc and these activities can be
shared with the entire company in a form of presentation meetings as the result the team brother
