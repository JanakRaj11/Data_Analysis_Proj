message from the ceo

setting high ethical standards in our way of doing business is an integral part of our corporate
mission statement within our natural sphere of interest we readily contribute to tackling social
environmental and ethical challenges beyond our legal obligations

as our mission statement says all group companies seek to promote a stimulating and reward
ing working environment through a flexible knowledgebased organisational structure more
over the group is committed to high standards of ethics quality and fairness and is dedicated to
meeting its environmental and social responsibilities

on that background it was a natural next step for us to join the un global compact initiative in
the spring 2010 pledging the group to globally embrace support and enact the principles of hu
man rights labour rights environmental protection and anticorruption based on this initiative
we have systematised our corporate social responsibility csr efforts and are now using a
globally recognised framework for reporting our policies activities and results

in line with the requirements of the global compact initiative we will annually issue a report on
our work with csr our communication on progress this document constitutes our first com
munication on progress and we continue to be committed to support the global compact initia
tive and its principles

systematising our csr efforts

in 2008 a process was initiated with a view to documenting that csr principles are firmly an
chored in william demant holding wdh and to facilitating that this corporate business phi
losophy would be more actively reflected in both internal and external communication further
objectives were

       assessing the need for formal policies
       identifying processes where csr could be further integrated

the main finding of this process was a strong track record of fundamental business values that
have guided management and employees this has historically contributed to wdhs attractive
ness as workplace business partner and investment object also we found

       no immediate exposure to risks associated with unethical business practice
       strong culture guiding employee behaviour more than written policies and guidelines
       strong but informal review of business conduct among cooperation partners most no
        tably suppliers
       a growing number of external stakeholders asking for clearly stated company policies
        and systematic actions within the field of csr

based on these findings it was decided to formalise wdhs approach to corporate responsibility
through the development of more transparent principles and policies and to extend the existing
supplier code of conduct

policies and procedures

wdh is founded on a valuebased corporate culture and limited use of written guidelines none
theless we decided based on the findings listed above to prepare a policy on corporate social
responsibility to facilitate the clarification of attitudes organisational anchoring and prioritisa
tion across business units and cultures secondly a formal policy would ease the communication
of corporate aspirations and initiatives to stakeholders who often expect formal policies within
this field

we have specified our key corporate responsibilities and contributions in 14 principles covering
four focus areas

       corporate governance ensuring that we maintain an accountable and efficient man
        agement structure characterised by a high level of transparency and responsibility
       people and society  ensuring that we contribute to the growth of society while respect
        ing basic human rights and maintaining a safe and engaging working environment
       environmental protection  ensuring that we limit any adverse impacts on the external
        environment
       business ethics  ensuring that we generate our business results in an honest and fair
        manner


                                                                                              page 3 of 7

the principles provide guidance for management and all employees moreover the policy is dis
tributed to relevant business partners and an obligation to conduct their business in respect of
the 14 principles is where relevant incorporated into contracts with third parties

we have also formulated a comprehensive business ethics policy and an extensive code of con
duct for suppliers all of which are available on our website

people and society

wdh supports the universal declaration of human rights and ilos declaration of fundamental
principles and rights at work these declarations are vested and strongly enforced in danish
legislation and our corporate culture we therefore see the greatest potential for improvements
in these areas of our work with potential and existing suppliers outside denmark eg in asia
and other relevant regions

responsible supply chain management

our interaction with suppliers is guided by relevant procedures in our certified quality man
agement system which includes a supplier code of conduct aiming to help suppliers improve
their social and environmental standards the code currently covers all suppliers of hearing aid
components and aims to expand coverage to the whole wdh group the enforcement of the code
is secured through a systematic integration of human and labour rights environmental concerns
and business ethics standards in our supplier selection and evaluation procedures

the code sets specific terms for the suppliers business practice based on the main principles
contained in the universal declaration of human rights the international covenant on civil and
political rights the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights the eight
fundamental ilo conventions and the united nations convention against corruption

at this point over 190 suppliers of components and packaging have signed an agreement to
comply with our code of conduct this group of suppliers accounts for about 8590 of our total
purchases

since 2010 all existing and new hearing component suppliers who fulfil a few specific material
ity criteria have been subject to a thorough review of their business practice the suppliers are
grouped in three categories according to the level of risk of breach of our code of conduct the
risk assessment is wdhs own methodology it is subject to independent audit and based on the
suppliers geographical presence sector management practices and strategic importance to
wdh the categorisation of suppliers helps us prioritise the resources needed for further dia
logue with the suppliers

if the assessment of a potential new supplier exposes a high risk of breach of our code an audit
must be performed before any further dialogue with the supplier can be initiated if the risk is
considered medium an audit must be performed before final approval of the supplier and if the
risk is considered low corporate responsibility is integrated into the dialogue with the supplier


                                                                                             page 4 of 7

but no audit is required in practice a site visit is almost always carried through before a sup
plier is approved existing suppliers are also evaluated according to this risk assessment me
diumrisk suppliers are audited once every 18 months and highrisk suppliers are audited once
every 12 months

in 2010 we carried out 28 csr audits of which 26 audits were performed by an external audit
ing firm with participation from our own team 25 action plans for corrective actions were made
in cooperation with wdh and suppliers where issues were found

we will actively combat child labour and forced labour and we have strict criteria for compli
ance with international conventions for instance a checklist with more than 130 questions has
been prepared by our organisation in china responsible for supplier cooperation in asia based
on this checklist a score is derived from the audit

we prefer to work with suppliers with a high score and have set up systems for followup and
action planning if the findings of the audit are not favourable as an example of the outcome of
an audit action plan one of our suppliers in china has now implemented more regular short
breaks in addition to the longer lunch or dinner break one of the results is an absolute increase
in production this has led the supplier to a new and different understanding for the employees
where the typical way of increasing the output in this area is to merely increase the pressure on
the workforce

if problems are revealed with an existing supplier our first option is always to cooperate with
the supplier to improve conditions if however a supplier fails to improve identified conditions
we reserve the right to terminate the cooperation so far no contracts have been terminated due
to ethical misconduct but a number of potential suppliers have been rejected based on a site
visit

a substantial part of our raw materials components and packaging derive from china and in
our csr efforts we therefore provide special attention to the asian region in april 2010 wdh
hosted a csr summit in china for asian suppliers where our position on csr was emphasized
experiences were discussed and representatives from the danish embassy in china presented
the danishchinese approach to csr

environmental protection

we have identified our main environmental aspects to be the use of chemical substances the
handling of electronic waste the use of packaging and energy consumption for equipment and
facilities but the environmental footprint of our activities is limited as very few materials are
used for the manufacture of hearing aids for instance a hearing aid weighs just 26 grams ad
ditionally the major part of our production is the assembly of finished components waste from
our production and offices is separated in appropriate fractions and disposed of with a view to
maximising recycling to the greatest extent possible




                                                                                             page 5 of 7

product raw materials

we have implemented the requirements set out in the eu restriction of hazardous substances
rohs directive in our main hearing aid factories located in denmark and poland the rohs di
rective bans six substances lead cadmium mercury hexavalent chromium pbb and pdbe
from products put on the eu market but our approach means that these selected hazardous
substances are excluded from all our products worldwide

furthermore in 2010 we established our own restricted list which in addition to rohs also
includes substances covered by the eu directives reach registration evaluation authorisa
tion and restriction of chemicals  and clp classification labelling and packaging of sub
stances and mixtures

in august 2010 we sent this comprehensive list of restricted substances to our 451 suppliers
the allowed use of each substance was rated from no use to a maximum level and by the end of
2010 suppliers accounting for 50 of our total purchase value had responded with information
about which substances they use and how much

reducing packaging

since 2009 we have worked on making unit packaging uniform and reducing the pack sizes in
2010 this has reduced our consumption of packaging materials by about one third as a positive
side effect the customers handling and storage of our products has been eased

our packaging is made from recycled materials

climate and co2 emissions

since 2008 we have chosen to report corporate carbon dioxide co2 emissions and climate
strategies through the carbon disclosure project cdp which enables a comparison with other
companies from 2009 our annual carbon dioxide emissions have been reported for the coun
tries in which production takes place the emission in 2010 was 33 tonnes per employee quite
a low level for a manufacturing company wdh is a company in growth and from 2009 to 2010
the overall emission level increased less than 5 compared to an increase in revenue of more
than 20 power consumption accounted for about 85 of corporate carbon dioxide emissions
heating of buildings for about 9 and company cars for about 6

wdh does not participate in any trading schemes and has not set any corporate reduction tar
gets due to the already low energy consumption level however the ongoing reduction of energy
consumption is part of the responsibility of local facility management at our sites at the head
quarter in denmark the electricity consumption has dropped 10 in 2010 in spite of an in
creased number of employees at the location this is due to the installation of new energy saving
servers new cooling unit in the server room tighter control of the overall ventilation system and
change to lowenergy light bulbs




                                                                                            page 6 of 7

business ethics

we are convinced that our business can only flourish if based on sound business ethics we de
velop innovative products of high quality and to benefit users through our products is our pri
mary goal we therefore have no interest in supporting business conduct that contributes to dis
torting market mechanisms wdh has not been involved in any legal cases or settlements re
garding business ethics

we do not offer give accept or receive bribery in any form and we discourage facilitation pay
ments

while all employees must comply with the laws and regulations of the country in which they op
erate employees may be confronted with dilemmas while striving to balance this requirement
with local cultures and customs in such cases it may be conducive to consult international con
ventions and guidelines to find an appropriate solution this also implies that local customs
which have served as a guideline in the past may be considered inadequate andor inappropri
ate

in 2010 we adopted a companywide formal business ethics policy which outlines how we want
to act and be seen with regard to the ethical aspects of doing business and interacting with cus
tomers specifically the policy provides guidelines as to what is appropriate and inappropriate
marketing hospitality and other interaction with hearing healthcare professionals

finally according to the policy we will incorporate business ethics principles into contracts with
third parties where relevant and we have applied a set of principles to avoid misuse of pay
ments and financial transactions

oticon foundation

the oticon foundation is the largest shareholder in wdh with an ownership share of 5560
the oticon foundation every year sponsors over dkk 50 million on social and educational pro
grams publications conferences cultural activities and campaigns  the receivers being both re
searchers hearingcare professionals and the general public



final words

the number of enquiries from investors and other key stakeholders in relation to our corporate
responsibility policies rose moderately in 2010 and we expect this trend to continue with our
participation in cdp and our global compact commitment we wish to emphasise that we will
prioritise and further develop these activities over the next years
