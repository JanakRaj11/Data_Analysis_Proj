 was due to the following events
   replacement of electricity meters                              devices for retail suppliers staff and to prevent offthe
   timely inspection of electricity meters                        meter consumption
   replacement of current transformers to lower power ones           installation of advanced accuracy metering devices
   installation of input boards equipped with metering                other measures in accordance with rd 3409254
 devices on the outer sides of individual residential buildings     instruction for reducing electricity process consumption
 for 14 subscribers to ensure free access to the metering          for the transmission in energy system and power pool grids
