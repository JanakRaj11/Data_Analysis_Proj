dear shareholders
   2013 was a special year for the group firstly the 25th of april i have had the honor to take over
the reins of unibailrodamco when guillaume poitrinal decided to bring the succession process
to a close i would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him who through his 18 years of
dedication to the group was able to turn a french company called unibail into the worldclass
leader in commercial real estate we know today secondly following this change in leadership
i thought it was also the right time to rethink the management board creating a new group of highly
skilled highly different and highly complementary individuals who i am sure will guide the group
to new successes

  operationally our ability to predict and understand customer expectations has enabled
unibailrodamco to deliver a remarkable performance in all its three activities despite the weakness
of europes economic recovery three fundamentals underpin the groups ability to remain at the
forefront of changes in the market concentration differentiation and innovation we continue to focus
our portfolio on assets with high growth potential namely large high quality shopping and leisure
destinations in the best locations as a result more than 90 of our retail portfolio attracts more than
6 million visits a year we will continue our successful disciplined approach to disposals  we expect
to dispose an estimated 15 bn to 20 bn worth of shopping centres in the next five years

 we use differentiation and innovation initiatives to further bolster the intrinsic qualities of these
prime assets the groups shopping centres have become leisure destinations true multisensory
environments with unique architecture spectacular events differentiating retailers outstanding
services and innovative digital tools in short we create exceptional places for the best brands to
meet the largest number of customers

  however this is just the beginning to continue to set ourselves apart we have intensified our
focus on innovation in 2013 ur lab the groups innovation incubator inaugurated its own campus
in december providing a real scale test lab to develop new concepts unibailrodamco has
innovation in its dna after digital dream iconic shop fronts the dining experience or the new
art of working for offices we will continue to dare to be different and redefine tomorrows retail
office and convention  exhibition assets

  we are confident that even the most challenging markets will reveal exciting opportunities for
those who are capable to innovate and make a difference 2013 was an outstanding year with
11 bn worth of projects delivered including aéroville located next to the roissycharles de
gaulle airport near paris and the extensions of centrum černý most in prague and täby centrum
in stockholm these projects as well as a pipeline of 69 bn are proof of the groups confidence
in the opportunities ahead

  none of this performance would be possible without the dedication of the groups exceptional
teams each of our assets is connected to the social economic and environmental issues of its
community embodies the operational complexity and turnover of a large company involves local
challenges and yet is managed by a handful of people our ambition is to be the leader in all our
markets this necessitates highly skilled and passionate individuals entrepreneurs whose vision is
to set the group apart

 our unwavering commitment to satisfying our stakeholders has made alll the di      ce
                                                                                     e in the

                    outperformed due
                    to two factors high
quality assets as shown by the 20
increase in footfall at splau a prime
