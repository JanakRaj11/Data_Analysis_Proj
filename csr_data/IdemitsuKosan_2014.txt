corp a major energy company engaged mainly in the marketing logistics storage and transportation of natural gas
liquids ngl lpg and crude oil primarily in western canada and the united states petrogas energy itself acquired
an lpg export base in washington state in may 2014 as a result of these acquisitions we now have altagass lpg
production facilities petrogas energys collection storage and logistics facilities including freight railcars and the idemitsu
groups sales network united under one banner this enabled us to initiate lpg exports to japan from north america in
august 2014 a full two years ahead of schedule it serves as an example of how idemitsu works to maximize synergies
between new and existing businesses and will eventually lead to the export of crude oil and other petroleum products not
only to japan but elsewhere in asia



     securing interests in oil fields in the north sea and offshore vietnam

in 1971 idemitsu established idemitsu japan sea oil development co ltd and began oil field development in the sea
offshore aga niigata prefecture we then began producing crude oil domestically at our agaokikita and iwafuneoki oil
fields but those fields have since been closed
    in 1989 we established idemitsu oil and gas co ltd which is now responsible for upstream oil and gas business

     providing solutions is at the heart of our company

in 1911 idemitsu began business as a petroleum dealer in the town of moji in the beginning its operations were restricted
to japan but the company was eager to open sales channel overseas the companys first venture outside japan was
in mainland china selling to the stateowned south manchuria railway which was headquartered in dalian during the
time of japanese annexation at the time mainland chinas petroleum product market was dominated by european and
us companies that kept prices high by providing such products at more reasonable prices we were able to successfully
become a supplier of machine oil to the south manchuria railway in 1914
    the grease used to lubricate the rail car axles would often freeze in the frigid climate of manchuria causing the
axles to overheat while taking a considerable bite out of railway profit idemitsu founder sazo idemitsu addressed this
problem by discarding the conventional oil specifications imposed by foreign oil companies as he worked to develop the
companys no 2 axle lubricant for winter weather a product that doesnt freeze even in the harsh cold of manchuria no                                                                                                                         lubricants
2 axle lubricant not only put an immediate end to the overheating of rail car axles it was the success that set the stage
for the creation of further highperformance lubricant products and provision of solutions to customers we have since
expanded our sales channels for lubricants and fuel oils to the rest of east asia and southeast asia

automobiles as well as electrical electronic information and oa equipment in japan europe the united states and asia
in the engineering plastic business in fiscal 2013 we decided to move production of allpurpose grade polycarbonate
resin to the plant of our taiwanese jointventure partner to raise our cost competitiveness also we were quick to begin
overseas production of styrene polymers and some other raw materials as well as processed resins that are sold directly
to customers we are also considering globally expanding other resin businesses

addition to supplying electricity generated from fossil fuels as an independent power producer we will expand our supply             based on the lessons learned from the 2011 great east japan earthquake in fiscal 2012 we revised our bcp

     environmental protection and safety assurance are important when handling                                                    additionally we hold annual comprehensive disaster drills based on various bcps at the corporate head office and review
     hazardous materials throughout the value chain
                                                                                                                                  bcps based on the results of the drills as part of our efforts to strengthen our practical response capabilities

the idemitsu group handles hazardous materials throughout its entire value chain from the extraction and procurement
of crude oil through sales the biggest material risk for the group is the major impact on business revenue of accidents
including fires explosions oil spills and the cross contamination of different grades of oil safety assurance environmental
protection and quality control are therefore of the utmost importance
    in the event of an accident at a refinery petrochemical plant oil stockpiling yard or oil depot there is the risk that
production will need to be stopped not only would this directly impact revenue due to the loss of business opportunities
and the cost of restarting equipment it could also cause longterm damage by diminishing the trust placed in us by the
local community and degrading the general publics perception of the company
    this is especially true since we moved to a framework of three refineries in fiscal 2014 while our capacity
utilization has increased the potential magnitude of impact on our operations of an accident has never been greater we
must therefore be extra diligent in implementing safety measures when jx nippon oil  energy corporation suspended
crude oil processing at their refinery in muroran our hokkaido refinery became the sole refinery within the prefecture
significantly increasing the social responsibility we had to bear based on this lesson we will promote extraordinary
structural reforms to increase the competitiveness of the refinery while ensuring safe operations and stable supply
    at the same time if contamination occurs during unloading at a service station or customer site there is a risk it
could lead to an accident affecting the vehicles that receive the fuel remedying such contamination in order to avoid an
accident takes considerable time and money the company must recover the fuel switch out products and clean sales

     reinforcing the seismic durability of existing facilities

idemitsu tirelessly works to strengthen its response measures in preparation of natural disasters as for earthquakes we
constantly assess and improve the seismic durability of our equipment for earthquake magnitudes set by the company
which go beyond the standards required by law as a result of our efforts the great east japan earthquake on march 11
2011 caused no damage to and had no major impact on any of our refineries or petrochemical plants
    on the other hand in light of the fact that the earthquake did cause damage to and explosions of highpressure
gas equipment at other companies we toughened our seismic durability standards for newly installed highpressure gas
equipment and to further improve the seismic durability of our existing highpressure gas equipment by may 2015
we will complete detailed examinations of all spherical storage tanks at our refineries petrochemical plants including
the anesaki works of prime polymer co ltd and other business sites in japan in addition we will confirm that all
equipment that may have a significant impact on surrounding areas in the event of an accident is compliant with the newly
toughened seismic durability standards we will also establish corrective measures to improve seismic durability for any
equipment that needs it

since fiscal 2004 we have been keeping track of the number of employees on leave for mental health reasons
employees on leave for more than one month due to mental illness in accordance with our inhouse rules we have
been managing cases in which employees are allegedly suffering mental health problems with worksite leaders and the
human resources department swiftly responding to and collaboratively handling problems as they arise in fiscal 2013
moreover we introduced an onlinesystem that enables employees to carry out selfassessments of their mental stress
as a part of comprehensive preemptive preventive countermeasures this system uses a questionnaire with 85 items
which takes approximately 15 minutes to fill in via a website the system enables users to identify possible mentalhealth
related issues and suggests preventive healthcare measures that they can implement on their own open to employees
to use without limit the system allows each user to retain and confirm their own assessment record and provides valuable
assistance to employees with their voluntary mental health management in fiscal 2013 we conducted two company
wide campaigns encouraging employees to try out this system and both enjoyed a more than 95 response rate with
employees going online to obtain evaluations based on these evaluations we offer facetoface counseling with industrial
physicians to those who find themselves in need of the advice of healthcare professionals


11 employees on leave for mental health reasons we keep track of the number of employees who are absent from work or on leave for
     mental health reasons at the end of every fiscal year with a view to protecting the privacy of employees however we do not disclose

by encouraging energy conservation in our business activities we help reduce environmental impact through lower
emissions of co2 sulfur oxides sox and nitrogen oxides nox while saving energy resources and cutting supply costs
to contribute to the creation of a sustainable society


     energy conservation in the manufacturing sector

idemitsu refineries and petrochemical plants account for a significant portion of the total energy consumption of the
idemitsu group therefore energy conservation activities undertaken at group refineries and petrochemical plants
contribute significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions because petroleum products and petrochemicals

     overseas biofuel business

biofuels refers to fuels created from renewable organic resources through fermentation pressing pyrolysis or other
processes there are high expectations for these fuels as alternative energy sources and because they are carbon
neutral they are garnering attention as a way to combat global warming idemitsu is also working to establish a solid
foundation for biofuel commercialization in southeast asia this is predicated on the use of plantbased raw materials with
minimal effect to the food supply and with due consideration of maintaining a healthy balance between energy stability
the environment and the economy as part of these efforts we signed a memorandum with the cambodian government
in december 2012 related to the development of biofuels cambodia has expansive fertile lands perfect for cultivating
cassava and other crops used as biofuel raw materials we are still examining the feasibility of building a vertically
integrated ethanol business spanning production and sales with the cooperation of the cambodian government

     response to biodiversity



     initiatives undertaken by our refineries and petrochemical plants


     actively promoting the greening of factories since the construction of our first refinery

idemitsus initiatives to promote the greening of factories can be traced back to the construction of its first refinery the
tokuyama refinery in shunan city yamaguchi prefecture completed in 1957 these earliest efforts predated the factory
construction law by 17 years it was not until 1973 that the law requiring the creation of green spaces was passed in
the face of significant environmental pollution generated during japans postwar period of accelerated industrial growth        the importance of factory green spaces in terms of biodiversity
in his planning of the refinery founder sazo idemitsu aimed to create a plant that would be valued by the public so he
introduced advanced environmentfriendly technology such as japans first desulfurization equipment to remove the sulfur       seges evaluations confirmed that idemitsus green spaces are being effectively used as places where communication

content from kerosene and diesel oil moreover aiming to not disrupt the majestic scenery of setouchi attention was paid      is fostered between each business site and the local community they also confirmed that the green spaces function

to the color and placement of the refinery and an expansive green belt featuring a western style garden was created to          as carbon sinks and provide habitat for wildlife on the advice of experts and to foster biodiversity we thin out the

separate the facilities from its urban setting the completed tokuyama refinery amid its landscaped grounds was in such         undergrowth in the green spaces and have recently begun to plant saplings in the resulting clearings in our planting we

harmony with nature that it was eventually nicknamed the parkland factory the vision the founder brought to this project     prioritize local species and aim to nurture our green spaces as woods comprising regional vegetation furthermore we

informed the subsequent construction of other refineries and petrochemical plants at present the hokkaido chiba aichi       monitor bird and other small animal populations because refineries and petrochemical plants handle hazardous materials

and tokuyama business sites manage green spaces that account for a total of 240 hectares or the rough equivalent of 50         general public access to these areas is restricted the green spaces in these areas therefore often function as sanctuaries

and environmental green evaluation system seges developed by the organization for landscape and urban green
infrastructure at all of its refineries and petrochemical plants seges is used to evaluate and accredit businesses based       every time new facilities are built on factory grounds idemitsu conducts an environmental assessment if endangered
on the contributions of their corporate green spaces to society and the environment in fiscal 2008 our chiba refinery and     species are identified they are relocated elsewhere on the grounds to ensure their protection for example at the aichi
petrochemical plant became the first petroleum or petrochemical industry facility to be evaluated attaining accreditation      refinery we established a protected area within the grounds to ensure people did not disturb the endangered plant
for excellent stage 2 by fiscal 2010 all our refineries and petrochemical plants had been evaluated at the end of fiscal     species salvia plebeia and fimbristylis sieboldii which were discovered when constructing new facilities at the refinery
2013 the hokkaido refinery the chiba refinery the chiba petrochemical plant and the aichi refinery had received
excellent stage 3 certification the fourth grade or the second highest level in the fivegrade seges system the
tokuyama refinery and petrochemical plant currently the tokuyama complex received excellent stage 2 certification                 initiatives for the operation of oceangoing tankers

management of green spaces and greening activities along
with outstanding achievements in environmental activities
such as regional contributions or biodiversity conservation
the chiba refinery and petrochemical plant was constructed
on land reclaimed from the sea it has worked to foster a
natural environment where the ocean once was promoting the management of green spaces over the 50 or so years
since it began operation currently the green spaces within the grounds have become a roosting area for local birds
the refinery and plant were praised for converting their landfills into parkland factories as well as their emphasis on
biodiversity conservation in its management of green spaces which provide a green belt that acts as a buffer zone they
were also lauded for their implementation of environmental education programs and contributions to raising awareness
about protecting nature

     waste reduction at refineries and petrochemical plants

as part of efforts led by nippon keidanren to create a recyclingoriented society the petroleum industry and the petrochemical
industry are each setting voluntary targets1 for reducing the landfill waste volume of industrial waste because idemitsu has
already attained these targets we have set an even higher target and have been working to maintain the industrial waste                                                                 scope of tabulation the hokkaido chiba aichi and tokuyama refineries
ultimately deposited in landfills at or below 05 of the volume of waste generated at all refineries and petrochemical plants in

     recycling of catalysts2

our refineries use approximately 2000 tons of catalysts annually in the process that removes sulfur from heavy oil
    used catalysts with reduced desulfurization activity are regenerated by an outside contractor and used again at our
refineries utilizing regenerated catalysts allows us to reduce the use of new catalysts by about 20
    moreover these used catalysts contain rare metals like molybdenum and vanadium when used catalysts cannot
be regenerated we sell these as valuable resources

2 catalyst a substance that accelerates a specific chemical reaction without being modified consumed in the process catalysts play an
     important role in the production process of petroleum products and petrochemical products




     recycling of petrochemical products

departments handling plastic processed products are promoting the development of easily recycled products made from
singleplastic resins and from recycled materials we have also established a recycling system for used plastic containers
these containers are used as ink containers and for other purposes

                                                                                                     idemitsu unitech recycle products


     reducing waste at service stations

we distribute our service station industrial waste management manual to idemitsu service stations to ensure compliance
with relevant laws and regulations among the waste generated at service stations empty plastic lubricant pails are
collected by an outside specialist company for partial recycling into resources used tires are collected for recycling by tire
sales companies and industrial waste hauling companies while used batteries are collected for recycling by the lead acid
storage battery recycle association

     ground and groundwater pollution prevention

since fiscal 2002 the idemitsu group has been implementing autonomous surveys of ground and groundwater pollution
and undertaking purification measures by fiscal 2009 the group completed onschedule surveys at about 1300 sites
including refineries petrochemical plants oil depots idemitsuowned service stations and idle land at those locations
where we discover any contamination we place priority on preventing the impact of this contamination from spreading
beyond the business site and make ongoing efforts for the remediation of contaminated soil or groundwater
