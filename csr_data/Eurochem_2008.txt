               he network of chemical enterprises potentially influences
               the environment of the regions understanding this objective
               circumstance our company constantly works to introduce
ecologically safe technologies into operation and to raise the level of
occupational safety for employees we consider preserving the ecological
balance in the regions where eurochem conducts industrial activity to be
a significant issue of responsibility towards future generations


we consider social responsibility to be a strategically
important component of the production and economic
activity of the company
     one of the chapters of the social report is dedicated to a
systematic description of the risks which the company may potentially
encounter and a description of the methods for managing these risks
our attention to the theme of economic and nonfinancial risks is not
accidental  the global economy is experiencing another difficult
period related to substantial transformations in international politics the
international financial system demographics regional development
and consumption in this situation together with the traditional risks
the risks whose source lies in the social structure of the global system
and in specific regional systems acquire significant meaning for any
large organization recognition analysis control and management
of these risks becomes an important separate task for the corporate
and strategic management of the company in the context of socially
responsible sustainable development


     on the whole the social report of eurochem for 2007 reflects
the ongoing progress of the company in observing both the practical
realization of the principles of corporate social responsibility and
sustainable development

     the extraction method
   at the gremyachinskoye deposit
   two methods for the extraction of potassium ore may be used given
   the conditions of the gremyachinskoye deposit mine shafts and
   underground dissolution through deep wells each method of extraction
   corresponds to certain mineral raw materials processing and enrichment
   methods there are two known generallyrecognized methods for
   enriching ore extracted using a mine shaft flotation mechanical and
   halurgic chemical

   the mineshaft method of extracting potassium salts is dominant in the
   world today this is explained both by the geological conditions of
   deposits of fields being developed and the fact that this method of
   extraction is the most studied in practice as well as its predictability and
   manageability compared to the the underground dissolution method
   for the operation of the gremyanchinsky field the most effective and
       ecologically safe method is the mineshaft extraction method




                                                                                                                                                                       19

   report itself is not a goal in itself for us  the companys priority was
   actual deeds in the area of social responsibility and sustainable
   development the process of social reporting using an internationally

   results we have achieved but also the shortcomings which should be
   eliminated in the future it is important to stress that the company takes on
   realistic obligations in the area of social responsibility and consistently
   fulfills them i am sure that this will also be so in the future during
   20052007 together with a series of russian and foreign foundations
   we realized a complex project in the area of social investment at a
   site in nevinnomyssk this project combined intense dialogue with
   local communities a competition among projects and a procedure
   for evaluating their effectiveness you can familiarize yourselves with
   this project in more detail in this report the company continued to
   work actively to improve the opportunities for employees professional
   and personal growth the level of salary rises consistently systematic
   measures are taken to improve working conditions and to hire young
   specialists we also work on developing a positive corporate culture at
   eurochem it is very important that the companys employees form the
   corporate culture themselves and introduce new traditions in issuing this
   social report we consider that accurate information on the company is
   one of the cornerstones of social policy it is of the utmost importance
   for both for those who wish to throw in their lot with eurochem and
   for the companys business partners overall one should note that the
   company has things to be proud of in the area of social policy and social
   responsibility but theres much more which remains to be done the
    main thing is that every year we improve something in a real way

 receiving a clearer understanding of how effectively these business
 processes work at all the companys enterprises this requires a wide

 documents visiting production facilities analytical work and detailed
 testing the inspections resulted in more than 150 observations and
 comments and for each of them a plan for corrective measures was
 developed by enterprise management together with our office one should
 note that around 70 of them have already been completed or are being
 performed our task is to point out those deficiencies that we see to explain
 why we consider a certain problem to be urgent what we see the risks to
   be and to give recommendation for possibilities for improvement

problem areas are the following
                                                                                         of salary issues the reduction of unproductive losses of work time and

     the first two risks are the most critical this is caused by the simulta

                                                                                      improve the structure of personnel employment
production development strategy is the determining factor in the de                  improve the qualification and quality structure of personnel lowering the
mand for labor resources on the other hand a series of demographic                     average age and the share of working pensioners
factors are causing a decrease in the supply of labor resources in the

into account the overall growth of the economy this results in an in                increase staff loyalty to the company
crease in the shortages on the labor market and a strengthening of
competition for labor resources


     in order to take preventative measures and provide warning for
these risks the company has developed a 5year strategy for human

which the main initiatives in the area of hiring and retaining personnel
are defined attaining qualitative changes in the professional qualifica

    and analytical work for evaluating the risk to the health of the population
    of the city of belorechensk and the belorechensk district related to the
    emission of pollutants from our enterprise the results showed once again
    that the enterprise works with ecological indicators that are significantly
    below the established norms i would note that the performance of a
    series of environmental protection measures costing around rur 544
    million played an important role in this among the most significant events
    regarding the protection of the watershed was the completion of con
    struction and start of operations of inhouse local treatment facilities for
    wastewater with productivity of 1 thousand cubic meters every 24 hours
    which makes it possible to input the treated water into the phosphogyp
    sum hydraulic transport system thus lowering the intake of fresh river
    water as part of the repair of the sulfuric acid production facilities the
    catalyser in use was replaced by a more active one in order to reduce the
    content of pollutants in emissions work was completed on the aspiration
    and absorption systems in the complex mineral fertilizer facility
    as for the protection of disturbed soils here a project is underway
    for the reclamation of one of the pits the sludge collectors of the dff
