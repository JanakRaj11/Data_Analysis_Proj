            challenges for
            the development of
            zero energy buildings
             the ministry of economy trade and industry has formulated a vision in which zero energy building zeb technology will be
             used in the construction of all new public facilities by 2020 and for all new facilities including private facilities by 2030 field
             experiments are also being conducted in various areas across japan for the development of smart communities designed
             to generate and use energy efficiently and comfortably taisei corporation is working to facilitate the development of zeb
             technology with the aim of optimizing the use of energy in buildings in smart communities
              zebs are designed to reduce the consumption of primary energy such as oil and natural gas to zero by making full use of energy conservation and
               generation technologies to supply energy required for air conditioning and lighting




            towards the development of zeb technology
             taisei corporation has succeeded in reducing energy consumption by half energy consumption reduced by 52 in 2010 in the taisei
             sapporo building completed in 2006 before all other competitors in order to further promote the development of zeb technology
             taisei plans to build a zeb demonstration facility on the grounds of the taisei technology center our initial plan was to complete the
             development of zeb technology by 2020 however in view of the recent energy conditions including power supply shortages as well as
             the ongoing global warming we are striving to complete the development by 2014

     the new value of zeb technology is to change
     the way of thinking about how to use energy
     the development of zero energy building zeb technology for urban areas requires more
     advanced higherlevel integration of architecture and facility technologies zeb technology
     not only reduces energy consumption to zero but also enables people living in buildings to
     understand how their behavior affects the environment thereby helping them think about
     how to use energy and urging them to change their lifestyles zeb construction projects are
     currently being implemented in various countries around the world including the united
     states singapore and south korea in order to play the leading role in the world it is therefore                           takaharu kawase

tsunami simulation
it is well known that the risk of a tokai tonankai or nankai earthquake causing a catastrophic disaster is increasing year by year coun
termeasures to mitigate this risk are essential tsunami simulations could make a significant contribution to risk assessment

                                                the bcp of a construction company inherently contributes to society

                                                the dark because we have neither factories or other production sites nor conduct business
                                                activities with our own facilities and equipment like railroads and airlines we have about
                                                1000 worksites nationwide but they are only temporary facilities so our business environ

                                                stances our answer to this question is to protect completed structures as well as structures
                                                under construction this task itself contributes to the business continuity of our customers
                                                in the event of a disaster we rush to our customers to repair their buildings and cooperate
                                                in repairing bridges roads and other social infrastructures we believe this is our mission as
                                                a general constructor we also feel socially responsible for tackling challenges that none has

                                       we should construct buildings prepared for emergencies and
                                       recognize what the public expects of bcp

                                       of a community does not lie in the size of its population but in how strongly its residents are
                                       connected to each other from among housing food and clothing a community can rely
                                       on others for food and clothing but cannot do so for the sense of security obtained from
                                       a building since the buildings taisei corporation constructs may become evacuation sites
                                       you have to think about what functions and human relationships are needed in places where
                                       people gather in emergencies you are also expected to propose energy supply solutions not
                                       easily affected by disasters such as energy supply diversification and local consumption of
                                       local products
                                       kawaguchi i think what it comes down to the idea that buildings need to be prepared for
                                       emergencies from now on i also think business operators are attracted to ecofriendly disas
                                       ter countermeasures like energy supply diversification this is where business opportunities
                                       exist so taisei corporation should provide attractive technical solutions


the primary role of civil engineering is to make people happy
now is the time to emphasize that point
ogata the civil engineering industry is proud to support peoples lives by constructing
roads bridges and other infrastructures and is responsible to do so the things that are really
important are often invisible and therefore often not understood but the primary role of
civil engineering is to make people happy and contribute to society now that the disaster
has deprived people of their normal life styles builders and users are in the same boat for
the first time ever if the construction industry declines it could threaten safe living in terms
of measures for snow and other natural disasters to build a good society the construction
industry will need to deepen its relationship of trust with the public through dialogues and
teach them more about the industry
kawaguchi the march 11 earthquake has reminded us that infrastructures are not always
available as public works have been associated with dokenya a derogatory name for build
ers it is important to get the public to understand the primary functions of public works such
as urban and civil engineering through dialogues with them

      we installed soil extensometers to monitor landslides that                      before constructing buildings and roads to provide further

           operating results
           although the japanese economy showed tentative signs of recovery this year from its decline caused by the great east japan earthquake the
           economy has yet to get on a fullfledged recovery path due to reasons including the economic slowdown overseas and the effects of the yens
           appreciation

           in the domestic construction market although a positive trend toward a recovery in demand emerged due to reconstruction demand following the
           earthquake and as a reaction to a rapid decrease in investment after lehman shock it is expected that it will take some time for reconstruction
           projects to get into full swing furthermore the private sector continued to face a difficult business environment as the competition for orders
           intensifies


           orders and sales
           for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 orders stood at 13795 billion yen an increase of 100 yearonyear due to rises in orders across all
           of the companys consolidated business segments net sales in the year under review amounted to 13235 billion yen an increase of 87 year
           on year


           operating income ordinary income and net income
           operating income in the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 totaled 364 billion yen an increase of 05 year on year caused by gross profit
           remaining more or less flat year on year due to the affect of the deteriorating performance of the real estate development business in spite of the
           rising overall sales for the fiscal year under review ordinary income in the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 stood at 302 billion yen an increase
           of 258 year on year as a decrease in foreign exchange losses led to an improvement in nonoperating income for the fiscal year under review

           net income for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 amounted to 11 billion yen a decrease of 891 year on year affected by a recognition of
           impairment loss and a tax system reformrelated reversal of deferred tax assets for the fiscal year under review




           outlook for fiscal year ending march 31 2013
           during the fiscal year ending march 31 2013 the japanese economy is expected to show a recovery overall supported reconstruction demand
           post the great east japan earthquake and the rebounding output the recoverys pace however is anticipated be moderate given the risk of an
           economic deterioration resulting from the persistently strong yen and the world economic slowdown

           the domestic construction market is likely to remain faced with a challenging operating climate due to uncertainties over the implementation of
           the postgreat east japan earthquake reconstruction efforts coupled with the concerns about japanese enterprises potentially revising their
           capital expenditure plans in the face of power supply restrictions and raw material price fluctuation risks

           in consideration of the abovementioned circumstances we forecast consolidated net sales of 1380 billion yen and consolidated operating
           income of 41 billion yen for the fiscal year ending march 31 2013 in addition we forecast consolidated ordinary income of 31 billion yen and
           consolidated net income of 15 billion yen for the fiscal year ending march 31 2013 furthermore we also forecast we will have orders totaling
           1360 billion yen

note 1 the estimation method of the fair value
		 assets
		 cash and time deposits and receivables trade notes and trade accounts
            the fair values of these financial instruments are almost equivalent to the book value because of the short term settlements although the
            fair value of receivables trade notes and trade accounts due over one year are based on the present value of discounted cash flows using
            the interest rate determined by the factors of the estimated collection terms and credit risks with respect to each receivable categorized by
            collection terms
		 investment securities
            the fair values of the marketable securities are based on the quoted market value and bonds are based on the market value the price indicated
            by a third party such as broker or the present value of discounted cash flows respectively
            see the notes on5 securities for notes pertaining to securities according to the purpose for which they are held
		 liabilities
		 trade payables notes and accounts shortterm borrowings and long term debt due within one year commercial papers and deposits received
            the fair values of these financial instruments are almost equivalent to the book value because of the short term settlements although the fair
            value of longterm debt due within one year are based on the same method as that for longterm debt
		 longterm debt
            longterm debt is the sum of long term borrowings due after one year straight bonds due after one year and convertible bonds due after one
            year the fair values of longterm borrowings are based on the present value of discounted cash flows using the interest rate which may be
            applicable when the same kind borrowings are made the fair values of the marketable bonds are based on the quoted market value otherwise
            the fair values of the bonds are the present value of discounted cash flows using the interest rate determined by the factors of the estimated
            redemption terms and issuers credit risk

note 2 financial instruments for which it is deemed extremely difficult to measure the fair value
