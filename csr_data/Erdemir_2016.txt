esteemed stakeholders

celebrating its 50th year of operations in 2015 the erdemir group progressed in line with turkeys growth as it
has since its establishment

holding onto the title of being turkeys only integrated producer of flat steel products the erdemir group has
achieved the stature of a global player in its industry by virtue of half a century of steady change and
development ever since it commenced operations in 1965 the erdemir group has been creating added value
for turkeys economy and industry not only through its production capacity extensive product line and
exports but also by virtue of the number of jobs it provides its solid financial structure and the taxes it pays

as the leader of the turkish steel industry erdemir group continues to advance towards its 2020 vision of
being a world class company on the back of its experience knowhow trusted brand and its seven companies

the erdemir group achieved significant successes in 2015 in terms of production and sales figures while also
continuing to undertake investments in addedvalue products and in productionprocess innovation with
production of 89 million tons of crude steel including 74 million tons of flat steel products the erdemir group
was singlehandedly produced 28 of all the crude steel in turkey last year

steel in a sustainable world
threats confronting our world and its inhabitants such as population growth climate change resource
depletion fossil fuel dependency and the extinction of species have been making the concept of sustainability
more important than ever in recent years

as well as the united nations numerous nongovernmental organizations and initiatives have been drawing
attention to such threats at environment and climate conferences summits and panels and also through
demonstrations and even protests as they call upon governments to take urgent action to deal with such
issues

one of the most important of these gatherings was the 2015 united nations climate change conference cop
21 that took place in paris with the participation of 195 world leaders in december of that year this
conference which culminated with the signing of an historic agreement to restrict global warming to well
below 2º c represented a new and important step in efforts to combat climate change this step which we
hope will also accelerate the worlds and developed economies in particular transition to a lowcarbon
economy is a major milestone in the building of a sustainable future

the increased attention being given to sustainability also leads to steadily greater acceptance of the
approaches of the circular economy which eschews the supply produce dispose approach of the linear
economy and which gives importance instead to recycling to economizing to minimizing natural resource use
and to recovering and reusing waste

steel which is an indispensable element of modern life is also an especially potent force in the lowcarbon
economy and circular economy models besides being used in every aspect of our lives steel is 100
recyclable that recyclability which makes steel a less natural resource and a less energyintensive material
will be important as long as humanity exists steel is a peerless commodity with no practical alternatives in
everything from renewable energy to green and intelligent buildings and from lowcarbon transportation and
fuelefficient cleanenergy vehicles to recycling plants

having originally embarked upon our sustainability journey with a concern for legal compliance and energy
water and carbon management we adopted long term financial strength and productivity focused
technological innovation as the essential principles of sustainability

in a world in which population growth will increase the need for steel and in keeping with its own 2020 vision
the erdemir group will conduct its operations and deploy its environmental social and financial capital so they
work within a framework of a sustainable business model while also maximizing the satisfactory fulfillment of

                                                                                                                      5

assigning an erdemir group chief sustainability officer who will be responsible for the integration of
sustainability into all business processes this office will be undertaking critical duties both in realizing the new
business practices and in achieving the aims that are set out in the erdemir group sustainability strategy

the erdemir groups sustainability strategy

oyak sustainability approach a set of values shared by erdemir and isdemir
erdemirs isdemirs and every other member of the erdemir groups approach to sustainability is rooted in the
oyak precept that the conditions under which people respect social economic and environmental needs of
present and future generations and where people and the nature coexist in harmony can only be created by
adopting the sustainability approach in every phase of peoples activities

like all members of the oyak group the erdemir group also undertakes its activities with an awareness that
their shared common natural capital consists of
 quality of life
 prosperity
 economic competitiveness
 employment and ecosystem continuity

the erdemir groups sustainability strategy therefore takes not only financial structure and strength into
account but also environmental and social facts as well its performance in all three of these different but
complementary areas is what it regards as its essential corporate focal point

the erdemir group sustainability strategy serves as a guide in all of the groups business and decisionmaking
processes

the erdemir group sustainability strategy is informed by the following principles
     create a sustainable valuecreation chain which is productivity and customerfocused at every stage
        from procurements to aftersales services and which includes rd and other processes
     protect the environment and use natural resources efficiently
     support uninterrupted social progress capable of addressing the needs of all stakeholders
     ensure occupational health and safety in the conduct of all operations
     foster a culture that encourages and rewards innovation
     for a sustainable society and a sustainable environment
     conducting our operations without harming the environment

protecting the environment and using natural resources efficiently
steel an indispensable component of modern life and a vital element of human progress is also an essential
component of the lowcarbon economy steel a 100 recyclable material reduces the need for raw materials
and requires less energy to produce it will be playing an even greater role in human life in the future at least as
well as today

critically important as ever steel is an influential and indispensable part of the efforts of technology and other
sectors to create a sustainable future in everything from renewable energy to green and intelligent buildings
and from lowcarbon transportation and fuelefficient cleanenergy vehicles to recycling plants

population growth resource depletion global warming climate change and similar issues in todays rapidly
changing and developing world have however belatedly led to an awareness and appreciation of the
importance of sustainability

the concept of sustainability has helped change the longstanding and widespread supply produce dispose
approach of the linear economy especially in developed economies that attitude is increasingly giving way to
the approaches of the circular economy which gives importance to recycling to economizing to minimizing
natural resource use and to recovering and reusing waste

the circular economy is a system in which products and production processes are redesigned so that waste is
minimized and anything that goes unused in one way is used in some other way it is a system in other words
which ensures that a producers products are conserved rather than discarded at every stage and later
reused the introduction of circular economic thinking increases the reuse of waste in production processes
and has begun to significantly reduce the need for natural resources


                                                                                                                  10

this is why the productive use reuse and recycling ability of resources likewise in the steel industry have
become an essential component of sustainable development although particular attention is given to such
factors as the impact of steel throughout its lifecycle the exploitation of steel production byproducts
recovery and water and energy management are issues to which particular attention is given in sustainable
steel production the fact that these things are amenable to constant improvement gives the steel industry an
important role to play in any sustainable future

by giving many different sectors the advantage of the features of steel that make it a sustainable product its
durability its long life and its easy and 100 recoverability erdemir supports efforts to make sustainability a
part of every aspect of peoples everyday lives in the conduct of its manufacturing operations erdemir takes
into account not just quality and economic issues but also social and environmental factors as well while
providing longterm clean and long lasting benefits through social and environmental improvements erdemir
also seeks to support regional and global development and to ensure production continuity accordingly
through its product sustainability approach and its products and technologies

as a member of the world steel association erdemir works closely with that bodys product sustainability
committee in its ongoing efforts to develop a common platform for and a longterm approach to sustainability
in the steel industry

in 2014 the chief sustainable officer was launched to operate in coordination with environmental managers of
erdemir group and related departments and to be affiliated to the chairman of the board of directors the
chief sustainable officer reports environmental and climate change issues like environmental performance and
co 2 emissions directly to the chairman of the board of directors

corporate citizenship attitudes informed by sustainability awareness
because its attributes support the models of the green and the circular economies steel plays an important
role in both

the erdemir group fulfils the sustainability responsibilities incumbent upon it in its capacity as the largest and
undisputed leader of steel production in turkey and carries out its operations accordingly

the erdemir group abides by the creating more value with less resources strategy of its parent and majority
shareholder oyak

the importance of technology rd and innovation to sustainability
when identifying its objectives and strategies the erdemir group believes that the new economic order makes
it necessary to constantly improve technology in other words sustainability means that we must be in
constant pursuit of ever newer and more innovative technologies that make a difference because their
development is the key to the achievement of sustainable success

in a world in which population growth is going to increase the need for steel and in keeping with its own 2020
vision the erdemir group will conduct its operations and position its environmental social and financial capital
in such a way as to make them work within the framework of a sustainable business model maximize the
satisfactory fulfillment of societys expectations and foster a culture of innovation

in line with everything outlined above therefore the erdemir groups primary sustainability objectives consist
of
       minimizing the environmental footprint and reducing the environmental impact of steel production
       life cycle assessment analysis of our products and using the results of such assessments as input for
          design processes

the value created for customers
because it is a part of every aspect of peoples lives steel is of the utmost importance to a countrys economic
growth and development

ongoing improvements in efficiency enable the erdemir group to increase its output of the flat steel products
that are especially important to manufacturing industries without having also to increase its installed capacity
the group satisfies turkish industrys flat steel needs in terms both of product diversity and of tonnage

innovative and green solutions that precisely address needs
continued expansion in the product line in recent years has made it possible for the erdemir group to further
enhance the value which it creates for its customers by making betterquality hightech steel that is lighter
more resilient and more reliable the erdemir group benefits itself its customers and the environment
working with its customers the erdemir group also creates mutuallyadvantageous opportunities to reduce
import dependency while lowering raw material and manufacturing costs

this close collaboration between the erdemir group and customers means that all parties are involved in
decisions concerning the features and requirements of products that are to be manufactured from steel by
developing steel qualities that precisely address needs the erdemir group becomes more than a steelmaker it
becomes an endtoend solution partner instead

it is because of the strong contributions made by this approach that the erdemir group is steadily increasing its
market share in sectors such as automotives and white goods where technical support and quality
expectations are especially high

the erdemir group works closely and synergistically with all automotivesindustry original and ancillary
manufacturers and it contributes ideas and suggestions towards efforts aimed at reducing vehicle weights and
thus their emission values

in the conduct of such synergistic collaborations during 2015 significant benefits were achieved as a result of
examining the materials which the erdemir group supplies to automotives makers improvements were made
in 10 of the erdemir goods procured by some manufacturers in another manufacturers weightsaving
efforts targeted parts were made up to 5 lighter

the turkish white goods industry has been growing an average of 11 a year for the last decade and a half and
it registered a 6 rate of growth in 2015 in terms of absolute numbers of units manufactured it ranks second
only to china in the world with an average turnover of usd 10 billion and output of 23 million units a year this
sector ships 75 of its production to 150 countries around the world



                                                                                                                   23

reducing the environmental footprint and minimizing
environmental impact
environmental management approach

respecting the environment adopting and promoting environmental awareness using all resources effectively
and efficiently contributing to the awareness and development of our stakeholders by encouraging
multidirectional communication and bequeathing a habitable world to future generations by constantly
improving environment management are the integral parts of erdemirs corporate culture

with its production process mostly relying on the existence and continuity of natural resources erdemir aims
at utilizing the resources in the most efficient manner without any loss and maintaining waste recovery at the
highest possible level while enhancing our productivity and increasing our profitability our approach towards
protecting the nature integrates to all our processes our most fundamental principle is to ensure high quality
production in a productive efficient accident free environmentally sensitive and resourcesmart manner

having adopted the principle of constantly improving environmental awareness and performance the erdemir
group believes in the importance of natural resources in its production processes

in order to maximize the benefit derived from natural resources the group on the one hand strives to increase
efficiency by avoiding any impairment of resources such as by discharging the least amount of waste into soil
air and water through the ecofriendly technologies that it prefers while on the other it undertakes projects
aimed at reusing resources through recycling

the erdemir group conducts all of its operations through a methodological approach which complies with the
law which creates value for its stakeholders and which is responsible and accountable the groups iso 14001
environmental management system policy is informed by managementbyobjectives practices by providing
objectivecompatible resources and by increasing all employees awareness of policy issues having
acknowledged that environmental management is an indispensable element of its corporate culture and is an
area of key importance to sustainability the erdemir group has therefore adopted and committed itself to the
following criteria the group will

       employ technologies which are in line with sustainable development approaches and which having
        considered the technical economic and commercial aspects release the least amounts of waste into
        the environment and conserve natural resources through the effective and efficient use of raw
        materials
       monitor assess and constantly improve the environmental impact of processes in order to constantly
        increase the groups environmental performance
       reduce waste at its source develop and encourage waste recovery and properly collect and dispose of
        waste
       inform raise awareness and clearly communicate to the groups employees customers suppliers
        community state authorities and all other social stakeholders the erdemir groups environmental
        attitudes and practices as well as the results that it achieves

when increasing its output and profitability the erdemir group is also endtoend mindful of environmental
conservation and therefore integrates the same approach into all of its operations in line with this
fundamental policy the group believes that it is important to maintain production quality through efficiency
effectiveness a zeroaccident approach environmental sensitivity and economic awareness

the erdemir group manages its environmental approach in tandem with the policies and objectives that it
defines in light of its medium and longterm strategies the group also communicates its environmental
approach to all employees as part of its management systems policy and it engages in efforts to ensure that the
same approach is internalized throughout the group




                                                                                                                26

certification activities conducted by erdemir and isdemir related to the environmental management
both erdemir and isdemir have been awarded iso 14001 environmental management system certification
which covers not only all of the companies production facilities and units but also their training centers
employee housing beaches guesthouses canteens and other social facilities efforts are likewise made to
review and improve iso 14001 performance in order to ensure the continuity of the environmental
management system every year this system is examined by the turkish standards institution in order to check
its continuity the iso 14001 systems of both erdemir and isdemir successfully passed their 2015 examinations
action was also taken last year to make improvements and revisions deemed to be necessary to ensure
documentation continuity

environmental management process
in line with its continuous improvement philosophy and sustainable development principle erdemir has
adopted an environmental management process approach in which its environmental management system
serves as a benchmark environmental management process starts with the feasibility reports for the facility
and the equipment before the investment and continues throughout the life of the facility the process also
involves the stage in which the facility and the equipment so as to ensure that all aspects from initial
constructioninstallation to operation and to final decommissioning which has completed its economic life are
disposed of in accordance with the applicable environment regulations

the erdemir groups environmental performance index solid waste recycling rate water recirculation rate and
co 2 emissionsmitigation rate in the case of energyrecovery projects all serve as the criteria by which the
success of the process of maintaining the ts en iso 14001 environmental management systems performance
is measured and assessed

the effectiveness and success of the environmental management process are evaluated at meetings which are
regularly conducted by the environment manager and which are attended by representatives of environment
related units

consisting of members from different departments and with different backgrounds the environmental
management process team plays an influential role in making environmentrelated decisions and investigating
and assessing issues and consequences as well as in making necessary improvements and undertaking projects




                                                                                                              27

environmental management process performance indicators

erdemir group environmental performance index
the erdemir group environmental performance index is a model which the group specially developed to
measure the success of its environmental performance and environmental management process besides
providing an important benchmark for process success this index also serves as an internal management
model by means of which existing environmental performances may be compared

environmental performance assessment management model




this unique model also developed by the erdemir group is the recipient of a number of national and
international awards and recognitions

the erdemir group environmental performance index is informed by local national and international
environmentrelated data which
     correctly recognize the environmental impact of production processes and of products and services
     show the sustainability of the environmental management system
     assess erdemirs impact on the receiving environment of its locality

care was given to ensure that such data include the environmental impact of their communication to internal
and external stakeholders and that they be data which are measurable accurately definable and illuminating
and which support a decisionmaking and proactive approach

the erdemir group assesses the environmental impact of the production operations which it carries out in light
of its environmental management approach and which it measures by means of its environmental performance
index from the standpoint of the requirements of laws rules regulations performance standards and
voluntary agreements the group also with an advanced technological infrastructure monitor the
environmental impact of its operations in order to quantify and analyze that impact and to minimize any
effects which data indicate they are causing

environmental management processes and targets are consists of three basic classes of parameters of which
30 are associated with permits and licenses 40 with statutory compliance and 30 iso 14001
environmental management system success criteria target fulfillment is monitored inhouse on the basis of
environmental performance index results

the erdemir group environmental performance index incorporates such criteria as water consumption
wastewater generation emissions solid waste recycling rates iso 14001 ems improvement efforts regulatory
compliance environmental accidents and investments all such criteria are constantly monitored and assessed
at both the general and the finedetail level so as to make improvements in environmental impact and natural
resource use and to increase the rates at which waste is recovered the same criteria are also used to provide
input for the erdemir groups environmental impact assessment eia reports

in the conduct of environmental management processes chief sustainability officer report companys
environmental performance directly to the ceo based on senior managements review and assessment of such
reports environmental concerns that are of importance to the industry are incorporated into company
management strategies taking national and international regulatory frameworks into account

the erdemir group environmental performance index is calculated on the basis of the degree to which the
abovecited targets are achieved a single value is generated for each target by multiplying the associated
impact and performance values this singlevalue approach makes it easier for senior management to keep
track of environmental performance

full compliance with statutorily mandated environment regulations
as is also the case in all other matters the erdemir group is mindful of being in full compliance with the
requirements of statutorilymandated environment regulations the group also has environmental impact
assessments carried out for any investment and modernization projects that it plans

rate of recirculated water
water is an important input in the iron and steel production process it is also a vital natural resource and
therefore the erdemir group gives the utmost attention to its use group members engage in a neverending
effort to increase their water efficiency year after year one way in which it does this is by taking pains to
maximize its rate of recirculated water use which is an expression of how much of the water used in
production processes is reused

more than 90 of all the water which the erdemir group uses once is treated and reused in production
operations productionprocess water is obtained by treating local available river water the erdemir group is
also currently working on ways in which to reduce its service water consumption by increasing the amount of
recycled recirculated water that is used in the system




waste management solid waste recycling
seeking to minimize its environmental impact the erdemir group believes it is necessary to achieve and
maintain the highest possible levels of waste recycling and recovery and therefore conducts its operations
accordingly waste which cannot be recovered and reused by the group is sent to concerns which are licensed
to receive and dispose of it

during 2015 422783 tons of erdemir and 317897 tons of isdemir solid waste were reused as raw material in
the companies sintering operations




slag recovery and reuse
under a project looking into ways in which to use the slag generated by steel production in highway
construction to improve its performance and to create a regulatory framework for such matters conducted
jointly with istanbul technical university the steelmakers association of turkey industry organizations and
the general directorate of highways slag taken from erdemirs steel production operations was analyzed to
determine its usefulness in highway construction according to the ts en 13242 aggregates for unbound and
hydraulically bound materials for use in civil engineering work and road construction standard work on this
project was still in progress as of end2015

        pyrolysis method for recycling organicbased waste in the steel industry
         the goal of this project which has benefited from tübitakteydeb support since january 1 2015 is
         to get rid of greasy scale and other organic waste such as tar decanter sludge tar tank sludge and
         benzene oil sludge by burning them at a high temperature pyrolysis the inclusion of other high
         organiccontent waste can improve the processs efficiency by generating syngas which eliminates the
         need for additional fuel
         work was carried out in 2015 to set up a pilotproject pyrolysis unit this included experimental
         studies the installation of laboratory equipment and the conduct of training and characterization
         studies

lifecycle assessment product design based on lifecycle assessment results
product environmental impact mitigation

lifecycle assessment in collaboration with the world steel association
the erdemir groups sustainability efforts focus especially on identifying the environmental footprint of steel
production supporting steel in all stages of its lifecycle promoting the lifecycle decisionmaking and design of
intelligent products capable of being reused and ensuring that waste is recycled




                                                                                                                  36

in order to achieve these aims the group initiated a steel lifecycle assessment study in 2015 lifecycle
assessment is an approach that considers the environmental economic and social dimensions of products and
production systems beginning with initial raw materials during operations and throughout their useful
lifetimes erdemir believes that all industrial concerns have a responsibility to carry out such assessments and
to inform their processes and operations accordingly for the sake of a sustainable future

lifecycle assessment goals
      determine the full environmental impact during the production stage
      identify the products environmental impact taking its entire valuecreation chain into account
      inform customers productmakers and consumers
      be prepared for use in regulations and standards
      provide input for co 2 and energy calculations
      environmental product declarations
      benchmarking
      analyzing the environmental benefits of steels recyclability
      preventing undesirable consequences by finetuning impacts

manufacturers plan their operations so as to reduce and minimize potential impacts at all of these points
what is important for manufacturers is to see the big picture and to include all the data capable of being
collected throughout a products lifecycle into their calculations identifying changes that should be made in a
products design that focus on the purposes for which the product is used is an important part of ensuring
sustainability

erdemir and isdemir are carrying out their lifecycle assessments with the guidance of a world steel
association team of lifecycle experts in the conduct of these assessments consideration has begun to be
given to such environmentalimpact issues as

        raw material iron ore iron  steel scrap use and recovery rates
        water consumption and water emission levels
        co 2 and particulate matter pm 1025  emissions
        waste generation recovery and disposal amounts including hf and crt slag
        primary energy demand and energy consumption
        global warming potential co 2  ch 4 
        acidification potential so 2  no x 
        eutrophication potential no x 

environmentalimpact reduction targets will be defined in light of the findings of these assessments
environmental benefits will be reported accordingly in 2016

climate change and energy management
as an integrated steel producers one of the most important inputs for erdemir and isdemir is energy both
companies engage in systematic efforts to use energy economically

the erdemir group management systems policy requires group companies to implement technological
innovations which enhance energy efficiency to maximize their exploitation of byproduct gasses and waste
heat and to minimize energy losses

in order to maximize resource efficiency all productionprocess byproducts with the potential to be fuel are
used as fuel rather than primary energy resources

as a result of structural and operational improvements achieved as a consequence of energyconservation
efforts in the erdemir group there have been substantial savings in specific energy consumption ever since it
started monitoring in 1982 in the case of erdemir the savings correspond to 445 while isdemir today is using
385 less energy than it was when it joined the group in 2001



                                                                                                                37

because increases in output have a direct impact on their energy consumption and emissions erdemir and
isdemir give considerable attention to them in their energymanagement efforts both companies conduct their
production operations with the energymanagement aim of using less energy for this reason all the energy
efficiency projects that are undertaken not only help reduce the companies environmental impact but also
contribute to their greater profitability

as two of the sectors most successful companies from the standpoint of specific energy consumption erdemir
and isdemir keep track of the amounts of energy consumed per ton of crude steel energy consumption targets
are also defined in the same way

both erdemir and isdemir have been awarded iso 50001 energy management system certification

erdemirs total output was 51 higher in 2015 than it was the year before whereas its total energy
consumption as measured in tons of oil equivalent was down by 11

isdemirs total output increased by 82 yearon in 2015 while its total energy consumption as measured in
tons of oil equivalent was down by 05

energy efficiency projects
erdemir and isdemir measures its co 2 footprint taking into account the carbon content not only of the fuels
but also of the raw materials that it uses the companys co 2 emissions also continue to fall in parallel with
each years energyreduction targets

taking a proactive approach to co 2 mitigation erdemir and isdemir considers the amounts of emissions that
will be generated or prevented during the conduct of feasibility studies for new investments all national and
international developments concerning climate change co 2 emissions and the amounts of co 2 mitigation
achieved through energy efficiency are assessed in the context of environmental management processes and
are reported to the ceo directly by the sustainability chief officer

in the twelve months to end2015 erdemir saved a total of 143310146 kwh
of energy and reduced its total greenhouse gas emissions by 78319 tons of
co 2 

in the twelve months to end2015 isdemir saved a total of 131668934 kwh
of energy and reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 81634 tons of co 2
