     dear shareholders
     2015 was a very special fiscal year for gea thanks to the extraordinary efforts undertaken by our
     employees we have not only set in motion an allembracing restructuring of the entire group but
     also managed to successfully hold our ground in an increasingly demanding market environment
     moreover in the previous year we were able to finalize four acquisitions with overall annual sales of
     more than eur 120 million

     in terms of revenue we were able to grow by 19 percent generating sales in the amount of eur
     46 billion with both business areas contributing record sales operating ebitda fared even better
     and was up more than 5 percent at eur 621 million this corresponds to an operating ebitda
     margin of 135 percent thus both geas operating ebitda and the corresponding margin have hit
     new alltime highs at 103 percent the operating cash flow driver relative to sales has also performed
     very well against the backdrop of these achievements the executive board and the supervisory board
     will propose to the annual general meeting that an increased dividend of eur 080 per share will be
     distributed for the fiscal year 2015 this dividend proposal does not only represent a new record high but
     is also in line with our objective to pay out between 40 and 50 percent of the consolidated profit

     new structure realized
     on june 8 2015 gea officially switched to its new organizational structure following a fundamental
     organizational change the group has fewer levels of hierarchy and a considerably flatter structure
     while being much closer to local customers on account of our unified country organizations the
     concentration of our overall portfolio as well as a stronger focus on the service business will promote
     further profitable growth and longterm customer retention this way we are seeking to further
     enhance our competitiveness

     the milestones set out for 2015 were reached on time under our fit for 2020 project we have defined a
     substantial number of measures that are being systematically and consistently implemented the
     transfer of several administrative tasks to shared service center locations in eastern europe and east
     asia has begun furthermore for being able to implement workforce reductions as scheduled and in a
     socially acceptable manner we concluded the necessary agreements with the employee representative
     bodies in all major countries including germany and france by the end of the year we had already
     realized more than half of the headcount reduction to be completed by 2017 within the framework of the
     project this helped us achieve savings in the amount of eur 23 million that even exceeded the upper

                                            letter to shareholders




boundary of the expected corridor of eur 10 to 20 million in 2016 we intend to increase annual savings
to around eur 80 million as planned while seeking to reach the envisaged savings potential of at least
eur 125 million per year from 2017 onwards

our new organizational structure which brings the development and manufacture of products and
the offering of process solutions together under the two new business areas equipment and
solutions has already revealed additional potential for optimization in the field of procurement and
with regard to our manufacturing network for this reason we anticipate significant additional
savings for the future

changes at executive board level
after more than 22 years of service with gea my fellow executive board member markus h√ºllmann
decided to acquire his own business that he has been running since the start of the year for this reason
he left the group of his own accord at the end of 2015 i deeply regret his decision since gea has lost
one of its key executive managers with a deep knowledge of the industry i would like to thank markus
h√ºllmann for his highly successful endeavors and the commitment he has shown in the course of the
previous years wishing him all the best for the new chapter in his life as an independent businessman

in september last year the supervisory board appointed steffen bersch and niels erik olsen two
internationallyexperienced senior managers who have also been with gea for quite a number of years
to the executive board with effect from 2016 these appointments are to ensure continuity while we are
also seeking to reinforce operational responsibilities in line with geas new structure

employees
after this challenging year my fellow executive board members and i would like to express our
special thanks to our employees for their outstanding commitment and endeavors in addition to
their daytoday business they were willing to go the extra mile and shoulder the work associated
with internal changes in traditional work processes and structures thus helping our new gea come
to life our thanks expressly include the employee representative bodies in recognition of their
performance our employees below senior management level worldwide will be awarded an extra
bonus in the total amount of roughly eur 45 million

outlook
apart from further implementing the fit for 2020 project geas main focus in the new year will be
on strengthening its foothold in the market we must show that the new onegea organization
mainly serves one target group our customers

moreover in 2016 we intend to consistently pursue our chosen path of strengthening our business by
making acquisitions in areas that will further increase the groups profitability  in particular in the field
of sophisticated process technology for the food industry in doing so we strive to offer our customers a
widening range of services from one single source in this context i am particularly pleased that in
february 2016 we concluded an agreement on the acquisition of imaforni a leading provider of
sophisticated production facilities and solutions for pastries the takeover of this company complements
the acquisition of comas in 2015 by adding complex production lines for biscuits and crackers turning
gea into one of the market leaders in process technology in this particular area

                                              letter to shareholders




     provided that there is no further decline in global economic growth and that there are no substantial
     changes in exchange rates and before nonrecurring items and acquisitions made in 2016 we aim to
     achieve a moderate growth in sales an operating ebitda ranging between eur 645 and 715 million
     as well as an operating cash flow driver margin of 100 to 110 percent this forecast also includes all
     savings that are to be realized in connection with the groups restructuring

     this means that in the fiscal year 2016 we will once again seek to further grow our business and
     press ahead with the transformation of the company in order to strengthen it by enhancing our
     competitive position the confidence placed in the future viability of our company by you our
     shareholders encourages us to continue along our successful path with the purpose of turning a very

     following intensive preparations geas new group structure  which was developed as part of its
     fit for 2020 initiative  was implemented on june 8 2015 with this new structure gea aims to
     bring about substantial savings promote further growth and enhance its customer orientation

     known as onegea this new integrated structure will see the development and manufacturing of
     products and the provision of process solutions and services bundled in two new business areas ba
      equipment and solutions in the year under review the business area equipment was headed at
     board level by markus h√ºllmann while j√ºrg oleas was responsible for the business area solutions

     the previous operating segments of the group were reorganized as a result thus the former gea
     mechanical equipment and gea farm technologies segments were allocated to the business area
     equipment while gea process engineering now belongs to the business area solutions the former
     gea refrigeration technologies segment was split between the business areas equipment and
     solutions with the goodwill attributable to the former segment being reallocated based on the
     relative values as of the reorganization date

     this new structure with two business areas of roughly equal size and strength promises greater
     operational synergies across technologies and applications and helps achieve functional excellence
     by standardizing processes

     the other companies area comprises gea group aktiengesellschaft and those companies with
     business activities that do not form part of the core business these include companies that report

area only selectively

operating segments

business area equipment
the business area equipment brings together all activities ranging from customerspecific to largely
standardized equipment offerings the products are mainly manufactured as part of series production
on a standardized and modular basis typical products of the business area include separators valves
pumps homogenizers and refrigeration equipment such as compressors the portfolio of equipment
also includes process technology for food processing and packaging the product range also extends to
dairy equipment feeding systems and slurry engineering

business area solutions
the business area solutions brings together all group activities that largely consist of marketing
customerspecific and modular solutions and projects this business area tailors its products and
services to the specific application or customer requirements the offering mainly comprises the
design and development of process solutions for the dairy processing brewing food and beverages
pharma and chemical industries

organizational units

national organizations
the new structure unifies customercentric sales and service activities under the umbrella of a single
country organization with the countries grouped under newly created regions geas reporting
processes are also geared to the new regional structure geas customers now have a single national
organization per country as the central point of contact offering the entire product portfolio and all
services on a local basis bringing together the previous large number of sales and service companies
will strengthen local competencies realize existing potential synergies even more efficiently and
raise awareness of the common brand gea in the market the national organizations are each led by
a managing director and are divided into two categories depending on the markets size and growth
potential the large and mediumsized national organizations have separate functions for equipment
sales and solutions sales in addition they have a service business a supply chain function including
local logistics warehousing and local procurement and operational marketing a small national
organization has a joint sales organization and a service business the countries are in turn grouped
under six regions a regional head which is at the same time a managing director of a country of this
region and agrees on country strategies drives forward market entries coordinates activities between
countries and allocates resources across countries

administration
the administrative functions were streamlined and more strongly standardized and will now be
managed considerably more centrally in order to ensure uniform high process standards globally as
well as cost savings the global corporate center is the central port of call for all supporting
management and administrative functions which so far have mostly been organized locally at the
operating units a shared service center with two locations will take care of the implementation of

                       combined group management report  fundamental information about the group




     standardized administrative processes in the future thus reducing the workload for the operating
     units the expenses of the global corporate center and of the shared service centers will be
     allocated to the business areas wherever possible

     discontinued operations
     discontinued operations comprise the remaining risks from the sale of gea heat exchangers and of
     the plant engineering activities especially lurgi and lentjes and the continued process of
     windingup past discontinued operations including individual legal disputes arising from them

     capital expenditure
     gea develops and engineers specialized components largely on a maketoorder basis and also
     designs process solutions for a broad range of customer industries the focus is on the food and
     beverage sectors with its global engineering and production network the group is able to provide
     customers with solutions that are precisely tailored to their individual requirements customers also
     benefit from our flexible production concepts which ensure fast throughput and low costs and
     minimize the capital tied up

     as in the previous year the main portion by far of capital expenditure amounting to eur 907 million
     previous year eur 938 million went on research and development and on new products
     494 percent the development of a new generation of the robot milker and of the dairyproq fully
     automated milking system are good examples in this context replacement investments accounted for
     208 percent of total capital expenditure followed by rationalization projects which accounted for
     140 percent eur 614 million of the capital expenditure was attributable to the business area
     equipment and eur 235 million to the business area solutions

procurement
in 2015 the procurement volume of geas continuing operations amounted to around eur 22 billion
on average the price of virtually all the finished and semifinished industrial products purchased by gea
in the procurement market fell moderately in comparison to the previous year the drop in raw material
prices also had a positive impact on gea in 2015 that said the sale of the former gea heat exchangers
segment significantly reduced direct copper and aluminum purchases so that stainless steel became the
focus of raw material procurement however directly purchased stainless steel made up a relatively
small proportion of the total requirement of this commodity as gea buys most of its stainless steel from
the market in the form of processed products

gea will continue to focus on strategic purchasing and also standardizing and consolidating cross
segment procurement activities in order to reduce the risk of fluctuating prices and to guarantee
security of supply

the universal gea class material group classification provides the information needed to do this as
well as giving highly detailed insight into supplier data and how the procurement volume breaks
down by region the system also forms the basis for defining strategies for the principal commodity
groups and is available to all purchasing agents at gea the gea procurement council gpc is
responsible for the system in 2015 the gpc was further engaged in unifying intensively the groups
strategic procurement operations

the new onegea organization aims to advance and provide significant support to the enduring
policy of collaboration adopted by the gpc founded on two robust supplychain units embedded in
the business areas equipment and solutions the new organization provides a raft of opportunities
for further consolidating strategic suppliers and deriving synergies from the standardization of
material specifications

     management system

     basis of information
     group reports are prepared with the aid of standard applications that are precisely tailored to the
     needs of gea and subject to continuous enhancement standard reports prepared on the basis of
     unified data are used throughout the group to report net assets financial position and results of
     operations these standard reports are supplemented by special analyses as well as analyses and
     reports related to specific businesses and strategic measures corporate planning which  besides
     several forecasts for the current year and the budget  covers a further two planning years is based
     on the same reporting and consolidation system as that used for the reporting of actual figures risk
     reporting too is founded on the same technical basis within the framework of the onegea project
     group reporting was further developed and adapted to fit the new management structures

     routine reporting procedures are supplemented by committee meetings that provide members of the
     group management with an opportunity to share information on strategic and operational issues
     meetings of the executive board of gea group aktiengesellschaft and of the extended management
     board global leadership team which comprises the executive board members the top management of
     the two business areas the heads of the six sales regions and representatives of the global corporate
     center gcc finance are held once a month the executive board meetings concentrate on issues of
     relevance to the group as a whole whereas decisions with a direct impact on the business areas and
     regions are prepared in meetings of the global leadership team before passing to the executive board
     for approval in addition regular meetings are held with the individual business areas these are
     attended by the competent executive board member along with the heads of the respective business
     area and business partners of gcc finance such meetings entail detailed discussions of the net assets
     financial position results of operations and business development of the business area concerned
     separate meetings for each business area are also held to discuss earnings for the latest fiscal year and
     the business plan for the following years

     key performance indicators
     geas overriding goal is to secure a sustainable increase in enterprise value operational management is
     based on the key drivers that have an immediate influence on value creation with growth operating
     efficiency and liquidity management see page 100 for this reason the key performance indicators for
     gea remain revenue earnings and the cash flow driver margin whereas these indicators were adjusted
     additionally for acquisition and exchange rate effects in fiscal year 2015 for the purpose of analyzing and
     managing earnings these adjustments will no longer take place as from 2016 acquisitions effected after
     the reporting date will not be taken into account in the forecast

     with respect to earnings the company focuses on operating ebitda gea defines operating as
     adjusted for effects resulting from the remeasurement of assets added due to acquisitions and for
     expenses that are nonrecurring in terms of their nature or magnitude the cash flow driver margin
     ie the net amount of ebitda the change in average working capital and capital expenditures for
     property plant and equipment and intangible assets is also adjusted for nonrecurring items gea
     also regularly collates a range of other performance indicators in order to obtain a meaningful
     picture of the overall situation

revenue is analyzed by region and customer industry on a monthly basis in order to identify emerging
market trends as early as possible in this context we also evaluate leading indicators the gea demand
index gdi  see page 88 and order intake

to enable a rapid response to developments the business areas are also required to return regular
forecasts  for the quarters and for the year as whole  for the key performance indicators revenue and
operating ebitda in addition these reports include forecasts of other performance indicators such as
order intake and ebit

in order to create the requisite financial scope to achieve strategic growth and to focus the group even
more closely on cash flow generation a new key performance indicator  the cash flow driver margin
was introduced in 2012 and was also incorporated into the bonus system for senior management since
2014 this system has also been applied to a larger group of employees

the return on capital employed roce calculated as the ratio of ebit to capital employed provides a
further performance indicator for measuring the value added that is generated by the groups operating
activities it therefore figures in both the groups regular reporting activities and the calculation of
variable performancerelated elements of management remuneration in order to anchor roce even
more strongly at an operational level the roce drivers ebit and ebit margin working capital  the key
driver of capital employed  and the ratio of working capital to revenue are monitored continuously
when calculating capital employed effects arising from the acquisition of the former gea ag by the
former metallgesellschaft ag in 1999 are not taken into account

the difference between the expected roce and the weighted average cost of capital wacc is a key
criterion for investment and portfolio decisions the group calculates wacc on the basis of the
following factors the cost of equity based on the return yielded by an alternative riskfree investment
plus a market risk premium and the beta factor actual borrowing costs and the rate used to discount
pension obligations

management of capital employed
resources are allocated within the group primarily on the basis of strategic and mediumterm
planning this provides the framework for preparing key decisions on core technologies sales
markets and other strategically important variables

acquisitions and expansion investments are assessed not only on the basis of key performance
indicators showing potential returns but also in terms of their importance for achieving the groups
strategic goals the key economic criterion for evaluating rationalization and expansion investments
is the net present value the payback period is also calculated as an additional benchmark for
assessing the risk arising from changing economic conditions

working capital is another key element of capital employed working capital management begins
before an order is accepted with the payment terms that are offered or negotiated

     project and activitybased management
     in addition to general management with the aid of the key performance indicators described above the
     group has established individual assessment and approval procedures for customer and investment
     projects utilizing specific thresholds for the different hierarchy levels customer projects are evaluated
     primarily on the basis of their expected margins gross margin on a fully absorbed cost basis and of their
     commercial and contractual risk profile with a particular emphasis on cash flow project management is
     also backed up by extensive project control not only at operating unit level but also  depending on the size
     of the project involved  at business area or group level in the form of a separate reporting system for
     major projects in many cases the findings gained from this analysis yield suggestions for improving
     internal processes which can be used in subsequent projects at group level the analysis focuses on
     deviations between the calculated and the expected or realized contract margin

     compliance
     compliance in the sense of measures designed to ensure adherence to legal statutory and internal
     corporate policies as well as compliance therewith by group companies is considered to be a key
     management and supervisory responsibility at gea for this purpose the company established a
     compliance organization some years ago corruption prevention antitrust law export control and
     data protection are the focus of groupwide compliance activities the chief compliance officer
     coordinates the implementation of compliance measures especially in these areas in this function
     he reports to both the executive board and the supervisory boards audit committee the chief
     compliance officer is assisted in his duties by the legal compliance and operating export control
     organization geas extensive compliance program is rounded off by classroom and webbased
     training sessions for the group employees responsible for compliance as well as by the integrity
     system which was introduced throughout gea worldwide in 2014 further information on
     compliance can be found in the corporate governance report see page 64 ff

     remuneration system and financial performance management
     changes in the key value drivers are also reflected in the remuneration of employees not covered by
     collective agreements variable salary components dependent on company performance are determined
     on the basis of the cash flow driver margin and roce in addition performancerelated remuneration
     depends on the achievement of personal goals of which at least one must be measurable in financial
     terms a further remuneration component is based on geas share price performance in relation to the
     benchmark index the stoxx europe tmi industrial engineering tmi ie

research and development
in todays global markets an engineering corporation such as gea needs to show an enduring
commitment to permanently enhancing its own processes and technologies it is this culture of
innovation that helps secure its enduring commercial success in addition to pursuing its own intensive
research and development activities the group also supports cooperative research projects with its
customers and suppliers

geas focus on product leadership is underpinned by the fact that around 40 percent of the companys
employees are engineers or perform engineeringrelated roles over 800 of these employees are
assigned to product development as a result of their work gea companies filed applications for a total
of 114 previous year 109 new patent families in the past fiscal year

the culture of innovation at gea can also be seen from its innovation competitions the gea innovation
contest which has been running with great success for a number of years now provides a showcase for
development projects that are potentially less than twelve months away from marketability the winners
of various preselection competitions get to present their projects during one day of the annual
international meeting of the groups senior managers who then rate the most promising developments
in terms of four criteria namely market opportunities earnings potential chance of realization and
level of innovation four new products received awards in 2015 spanning areas such as the manufacture of
instant coffee automatic livestock milking selfpriming centrifugal pumps and the fermentation process
of dough

in conventional coffee bean extraction for the manufacture of instant coffee powder the final yield
barely exceeds 50 percent the awardwinning process represents a completely new concept the
enhanced twostage grinding process increases the surface area of the coffee powder thus paving the
way for gentler aroma extraction and hydrolysis at a lower temperature level all this results in a better
taste experience more closely resembling that of fresh coffee not to mention a reduction in energy
consumption the next stage in the manufacturing process is enzyme treatment to break down a
greater proportion of the ground coffee thereby considerably increasing the yield to an impressive
70 percent this represents a significant advance as over twothirds of the entire cost of manufacturing
instant coffee goes on the coffee beans themselves all in all the increased yield and improved taste
clearly add value for gea customers and costs are expected to be amortized quickly

automatic milking systems are becoming increasingly popular  not only among large dairy farms but
also among smaller ones also seeking to benefit from greater flexibility in their daily routine improved
ergonomics at the workplace and more efficient use of their personnel resources with a view to meeting
the needs of very differentlysized farms gea has developed a unique platform technology in respect of
which a number of patent applications have been filed the modular platform covers the entire range of
milking systems from singlebox milking robots all the way to rotary milking parlors this new
generation of milking robots is more efficient and easier to install it has also helped to improve animal
health monitoring and reduce customers operating costs

     centrifugal pumps are used to convey lowviscosity liquids from one container to the next although
     conventional centrifugal pumps ensure efficiency and hygiene as well as gentle product handling they
     are not selfpriming selfpriming additionally enables the pumps to convey liquids containing gas or
     foam or to evacuate gas from extensive pipe systems before suctioning liquids in the past liquid ring
     pumps were generally used although selfpriming was possible with these pumps they did not offer the
     advantages outlined above the gea tps variflow is a new selfpriming centrifugal pump that
     combines the functional principles and benefits of both types of pump a patent application has been
     filed for its newly developed flow control system

     large industrial bakeries are becoming increasingly important such establishments are particularly
     interested in a continuous production process that makes efficient use of the available production
     space this process generally involves a proofer in which the bread or yeast dough is exposed to a
     warmer temperature and humidity during fermentation allowing the fermentation process to take
     place on the conveyor belt or rather on a spiral belt makes optimum use of the available production
     space while simultaneously cutting energy costs gea is already applying this kind of spiral
     technology successfully in the form of the gea froster stec to transform this spiral froster into a
     spiral proofer the air temperature has to be raised from minus 18 c to plus 28 c  among a number
     of other modifications this gea innovation contest award winner also succeeded in developing an
     innovative air distribution system and adding an ultrasonic air humidifier gea spiral technology can
     thus be used to tap into a new growth market

     as a result of this intensive research and development work gea succeeded in launching many new
     products in the past fiscal year too and presented them at more than 200 trade fairs at the anuga
     foodtec fair for example gea took home no fewer than three prizes two of the four dairy technology
     awards  for the efficient gea ecoforce decanter family and for gea provident flow analysis a tool
     that integrates and optimizes overall production management in food processes  and an international
     foodtec award gold medal in the process technology category for the gea multidrum this machine
     sets new standards in the application of homestyle breading increasing performance in terms of
     efficiency and a cleaner work environment gea also presented an innovative freeze concentration
     system for the first time at the anuga foodtec fair this offers customers significantly lower acquisition
     and operating costs while cutting space requirements by half it was achieved by switching from a
     batch process to a patentpending continuous process in which fruit juice coffee milk or delicate
     enzyme solutions are cooled until ice forms the crystallizer ensures that an optimum amount of larger
     ice crystals is formed this suspension is then separated into the concentrate and the ice in the
     downstream wash column fruit juice concentrate can be transported more cheaply and in a more
     environmentally friendly manner than the fruit juice itself coffee concentrate is processed into instant
     coffee and enzyme concentrates can be used for example to manufacture drugs the competing
     alternatives to freeze concentration are vacuum evaporation and reverse osmosis since the
     temperatures used in these processes are only slightly higher only very few vitamins are lost for

     report on economic position
     gea in fiscal year 2015
     the forecast for fiscal year 2015 assumed that demand in geas sales markets would moderately
     exceed the high levels seen in 2014 contrary to this assumption growth in the emerging markets in
     particular was more sluggish than predicted at the start of 2015 indeed during the second half of the
     year the international monetary fund imf also had to reduce its forecast for global economic
     growth adjusting the figures in the updates to the world economic outlook downwards in july and
     again in october see page 35 f growth was slower than initially forecasted in both the
     industrialized nations and the emerging markets  ie in all of geas key markets see imf world

     against a backdrop of ongoing weakness in the global economy  particularly in the emerging
     economies including china  and a further reduction in iwf expectations for economic growth in
     2015 gea also reduced its growth target for revenue in the third quarter measures to improve the
     earnings situation however coupled with a reduction in the investment volume enabled the group to
     raise expectations slightly for the cash flow driver margin in the financial report for the third quarter

     as announced in september 2015 gea generated moderate revenue growth of 19 percent in 2015
     adjusted for exchange rate and acquisition effects however organic growth in revenue decreased by
     42 percent therefore the moderate rise in revenue adjusted for exchange rate and acquisition
     effects predicted at the start of 2015 did not materialize as expected the former gea refrigeration
     technologies segment posted aboveaverage organic growth the former gea mechanical equipment
     and gea process engineering segments posted slightly below average growth which was also
     expected the main reason for the surprisingly weak revenue figures of the former gea farm
     technologies segment was the noticeable slump in milk prices

     in the 2014 annual report operating ebitda adjusted for exchange rate and acquisition effects of
     between eur 580 million and eur 620 million was predicted for 2015 operating ebitda actually
     amounted to eur 6210 million in the fiscal year these figures include positive exchange rate and
     acquisition effects of eur 266 million and eur 87 million respectively thus the ebitda figure of
     eur 5857 million which is comparable with the forecast was within the defined target range

                               combined group management report  report on economic position




however the target range of eur 590 to eur 640 million set in the first quarter of 2015 was slightly
missed

a target of between 90 and 95 percent was originally set for the cash flow driver margin adjusted for
exchange rate and acquisition effects in 2015 the predicted value was raised to between 95 and
100 percent in the financial report for the third quarter ultimately a cash flow driver margin adjusted
for nonrecurring items and acquisition effects of 106 percent was achieved in the reporting year when
not adjusted for acquisition effects however the value was 103 percent which means that even the
increased target range was exceeded by far

on april 16 2015 gea group aktiengesellschafts annual general meeting approved the proposal by
the supervisory board and executive board to pay a dividend of eur 070 per share for fiscal year
2014 up from eur 060 per share this means that the distribution to the shareholders for 2015 was
in line with the new target of 40 to 50 percent of group earnings

macroeconomic environment
as a global engineering company gea considers growth in gross domestic product gdp and hence
the international monetary funds imf associated assessments to be the key benchmark for its own
development the objective is that geas growth exceeds the global economys growth

according to its latest estimates for 2015 the imf is looking at global economic growth of 31 percent
world economic outlook january 2016  at the start of 2015 the imf had predicted gdp growth of
35 percent

above all the slowing of economic activity in china and its reorientation away from investment and
industrial goods toward services and consumer goods had a detrimental effect on prospects for global
economic growth according to the imf what is more low energy and commodity prices in
particular the enduring slump in the price of oil were hampering growth in the oilexporting nations




                                                        gea annual report 2015                                         35

                          combined group management report  report on economic position




     at the same time demand for oil had not risen on the same scale as witnessed during previous low
     price phases despite the lower costs an additional risk according to the experts at the imf was the
     gradual change in monetary policy in the usa

     specifically the imf has determined a preliminary growth rate of 19 percent for the industrialized
     nations in 2015 after 18 percent in the previous year the eurozone economy continued to grow last year
     from 09 percent in 2014 to 15 percent in 2015 growth in the usa had increased to 25 percent in
     2015 up from 24 percent in 2014 by contrast the experts at the imf are expecting growth in germany to
     contract slightly by 01 percentage points in 2015 down to 15 percent

     according to the imf economic growth in the emerging markets fell from 46 percent in 2014 to
     40 percent in 2015  the fifth year in a row in which growth had contracted even more significant was
     the slump in the russian economy where growth fell to 37 percent in 2015 after a positive figure of
     06 percent a year earlier the imf forecasts for china make just as gloomy reading here economic
     growth fell by a further 04 percentage points in 2015 down to 69 percent economic growth is thought
     to have further slowed in latin america declining to 03 percent from 13 percent in 2014



     significant changes

     new group structure
     following intensive preparations geas new group structure  which was developed as part of its
     fit for 2020 initiative  was implemented on june 8 2015 as part of this new structure the
     development and manufacturing of products and the provision of process solutions have been
     bundled in two new business areas  equipment and solutions see page 24 f

     geas plans to implement a new group structure are proceeding according to schedule key
     milestones along the path to implementing the target organization some of which affect germany
     the country with the most gea employees have now been reached negotiations with the group
     works council concerning the measures and the options for managing restructuring in a socially
     responsible way have been concluded outside germany implementation is also progressing
     according to plan by the end of the fiscal year the workforce had already been reduced by more than
     800 fulltime equivalents as a result of the initiative
     for reporting purposes the figures for the months prior to the switchover and the figures for the
     previous year were aligned to the new reporting structure

     with the project fit for 2020 project the target is to achieve annual cost savings of at least
     eur 125 million as from 2017 based on todays business volume the implementation measures will
     probably result in a net reduction in global personnel capacity of around 1450 equivalents

     acquisitions

     acquired on october 6 2014 see page 30 of the 2014 annual report the de klokslag group

results of operations financial position and net assets

results of operations
gea remains committed to its policy of consciously selecting orders on the basis of their price quality
and contract terms this is reflected in the multistage approval process for major customer projects

whenever operative earnings are referred to in the following this relates on the one hand to adjustments
for purchase price allocation effects that were determined for all material past acquisitions and on the
other hand to the adjustment of expenses for restructuring and strategy projects in addition the figures
for operating ebitda have been adjusted for currency translation effects and acquisitions the allocation in
accordance with ifrs of service and trademark fees was adjusted in fiscal year 2014

operating ebit for 2015 was adjusted for nonrecurring items in the amount of eur 1974 million
previous year eur 507 million eur 1926 million of these items was attributable to strategy
projects of which eur 1256 million was restructuring expenses see page 218 f

the gross margin adjusted for nonrecurring items for the whole of 2015 amounted to 323 percent a
slight improvement on the previous year

in fiscal year 2015 ebitda fell by eur 1101 million compared with the prioryear period to
eur 4298 million largely due to high nonrecurring costs this corresponds to an ebitda margin of
93 percent previous year 120 percent adjusted for the abovementioned nonrecurring items of
eur 1900 million operating ebitda amounted to eur 6210 million the eur 303 million increase
compared with the previous year eur 5907 million was due in particular to the significant
improvement in earnings of food processing  packaging gratifying business growth in the field of
compression and  last but not least  to the ongoing expansion in service business in addition the
fit for 2020 program already bore fruit in terms of cost savings in the reporting year as a result
the operating ebitda margin improved by a further 40 basis points to 135 percent of revenue
operating ebitda in 2015 of eur 6210 million included positive currency translation and
acquisition effects of eur 266 million and eur 87 million respectively thus the ebitda figure
comparable with the announced forecast in the annual report amounts to eur 5857 million

both operating ebitda and the operating ebitda margin represent alltime highs for the new gea

     operating ebitda margin also improved by more than 120 basis points to 164 percent of revenue
     thus the business area equipment posted record highs in terms of both operating ebitda and
     operating ebitda margin the chief reason for this positive earnings showing was the significant
     improvement in earnings in food processing  packaging in addition to the expansion in service
     business and gratifying business growth in the field of compression the operating ebitda already
     included positive currency translation and acquisition effects of eur 136 million and eur 06

     net interest income for the whole year amounted to eur 394 million well below the prioryear
     figure of eur 660 million the eur 266 million improvement is attributable on the one hand to
     lower interest expenses from interest accrued on pension provisions and on the other to lower bank
     interest payments due to the repayment of financial liabilities using proceeds from the sale of the
     former gea heat exchangers segment

     ebt in fullyear 2015 amounted to eur 2700 million eur 1038 million lower than the previous
     years figure eur 3738 million and largely due to high nonrecurring costs the ebt margin fell
     accordingly from 83 percent in the previous year to 59 percent

     profit from discontinued operations amounted to eur 976 million in fiscal year 2015 previous
     year eur 346 million this result includes the settlement of legal disputes in connection with the
     former business activities of mg technologies ag in the previous year profit from discontinued operations
     was almost exclusively attributable to the former gea heat exchangers segment see page 160

     the income tax expense of eur 58 million in fiscal year 2015 previous year eur 878 million
     comprised current tax expenses of eur 614 million previous year eur 807 million and income
     from deferred taxes of eur 557 million previous year eur 71 million deferred tax expense as a
     result notably of special factors relating to discontinued operations and expected higher tax income
     in the future tax rate amounted to just 21 percent in the reporting year previous year 235 percent

     in the fiscal year the group result amounted to eur 3619 million previous year eur 3206 million
     almost all of which was attributable to gea group aktiengesellschaft shareholders previous
     year eur 3205 million taking into account the unchanged average number of shares compared
     with the previous year 192495476 this corresponds to earnings per share of eur 188 previous
     year eur 166

     in addition to holding company costs in the narrower sense the results of operations of gea group
     aktiengesellschaft are primarily driven by net investment income and net interest income further

from the sale of the gea heat exchangers segment however liquidity management and centralized
financial management remain of key significance due among other factors to the volatile markets

eur 1000 million with the aim of securing advantageous conditions for the company the syndicated
credit line club deal was extended to 2020 in august 2015 this loan features two further 12month
prolongation options until max 2022

the groups financial management encompasses liquidity management group financing and the
management of interest rate and currency translation risks as the group management company gea
group aktiengesellschaft is responsible for geas central financial management which aims to reduce
financing costs as far as possible to optimize interest rates for financial investments to minimize
counterparty credit risk to leverage economies of scale to hedge interest rate and exchange rate risk
exposures as effectively as possible and to ensure that loan covenants are complied with the goal of
geas financing strategy is not only to be able to meet its payment obligations whenever they fall
due but also to ensure that sufficient cash reserves are always available in the form of credit lines in
addition to maintaining a strategic cash position the centralized liquidity portfolio is managed
mainly for capital preservation and risk reduction by diversifying the cash investments

cash flow from operating activities is the most important source of liquidity intragroup cash pooling
aims to limit external cash investments and borrowings to as low a level as possible to achieve this
gea has established cash pooling groups in 13 countries that automatically balance the accounts of
the participating group companies every day by crediting or debiting a target account at gea group
aktiengesellschaft any additional liquidity requirements are generally borrowed by group
management which also invests surplus liquidity in a number of cases however liquidity peaks in
individual countries cannot be reduced on a crossborder basis due to legal or taxrelated reasons

the company further increased its net liquidity including discontinued operations by eur 783 million
to eur 9820 million as of december 31 2015

     overall assessment of business development
     despite another economic downturn and the burden of extensive group reorganization gea closed
     fiscal year 2015 with success the key indicators for the group underscore this solid performance

     at the start of the year an increasingly challenging market environment characterized by the greek
     sovereign debt crisis was further exacerbated by an economic downswing in many emerging markets
      notably in china geas second biggest market increasing geopolitical tensions also had a negative
     impact on global economic growth

     inside the company geas new group structure  more centralized on the inside while ensuring
     much more direct lines of contact with the customer on the outside thanks to uniform national
     organizations  was implemented on schedule by the end of the year the savings made even
     surpassed expectations slightly 2015 additionally saw the company complete four acquisitions with
     an annual revenue volume of more than eur 120 million against this backdrop the company can
     look back on what was a more than solid performance in the fiscal year 2015

     despite the challenging business environment gea posted growth in revenue of 19 percent the
     value of eur 46 billion constituting an alltime record both business areas played a part in this
     outcome with record revenue volumes and the operating result ebitda was even better this
     indicator increasing by more than 5 percent to eur 6210 million this corresponds to an operating

ebitda margin of 135 percent both operating ebitda and the corresponding margin represent all
time highs for gea with respect to our operating cash flow driver a very good ratio to revenue of
103 percent was also achieved gea therefore remains in robust economic shape

summing up with the exception of revenue it can be said that all forecasts communicated at the
beginning of fiscal year 2015 were met or exceeded and that the increased earnings per share and the
provisions set aside under commercial law of gea group aktiengesellschaft have made it possible to
propose a higher dividend all told therefore geas business development in 2015 can be considered
positive

     if the services of the executive board members entail an extraordinary increase in shareholder value
     the supervisory board may at its sole and reasonable discretion grant a special bonus in accordance
     with the executive board service agreements the executive board members are not entitled to

     entry into force of the act on equal participation of women and men in executive positions in the
     private and the public sector implies a legally binding minimum quota of 30 percent for the
     underrepresented gender on the supervisory board that will be applicable to any future supervisory
     board elections held as of 2016 in the future the supervisory board candidates proposed for election
     will comply with this requirement

     subject to the maximum statutory period mentioned above in the light of the brief initial deadline for
     implementation ending on june 30 2017 the two defined targets of 181 percent andor 235 percent
     reflect the status quo at the time the company made this commitment which of course does not
     preclude an increase in the share of women on these two management levels

     in due time the other gea group companies affected by this law also set targets for the proportion of
     women represented on the supervisory board andor the board of directors as well as the two
     uppermost management levels below the board of directors and defined the deadlines for
     implementing these targets

executive board remuneration

general remarks
acting on the recommendation of the presiding committee the supervisory board determines the
total remuneration of the individual executive board members and resolves on the remuneration
system applicable to the executive board the supervisory board reviews the appropriateness of the
remuneration at regular intervals criteria for determining the appropriateness of the remuneration
include the responsibilities of the individual executive board members their respective personal
performance the business situation the success and the future prospects of the company as well as
the common level of compensation taking into account the peer companies and the compensation
structure in place in other areas of the company

creating an incentive geared towards successful and sustainable corporate governance represents an
essential element of any decision taken with regard to the remuneration system the latter is to
ensure that the executive board members strive for the longterm success of the company while
participating in a sustainable value enhancement for this reason a significant part of total
remuneration is tied to geas share performance as well as key performance indicators notably a
combination of cash flow aspects and the return on capital employed roce ie a ratio for
measuring return on capital this ensures that outstanding performance is adequately rewarded and
nonaccomplishment of set targets results in a reduction in remuneration

the remuneration system that was approved by a large majority of the votes at the annual general
meeting held on april 24 2012 comprises nonperformancerelated and various performancerelated
andor variable components the variable remuneration system seeks to provide for a highly balanced
risk and opportunity profile from the shareholders and executive boards perspective and to further
enhance the sustainability of the remuneration system by decoupling shortterm from longterm bonus
elements in addition it is comparatively simple to transfer the system to the management levels below
executive board level thereby guaranteeing enhanced operations management

     remuneration components
     in the fiscal year 2015 the remuneration of the executive board members was composed as follows

     fixed components of remuneration and fringe benefits
     the nonperformancerelated component of remuneration mainly consists of a fixed annual salary
     that is paid in twelve equal installments at the end of each calendar month

     the fixed annual salary awarded to j√ºrg oleas in the year under review amounted to eur 1250
     thousand per annum dr helmut schmales remuneration for the period starting january 1 2015
     through march 31 2015 totaled eur 675 thousand per annum increasing to eur 700 thousand per
     annum for the period commencing april 1 2015 through december 31 2015 dr stephan petris
     salary for the period starting january 1 2015 through may 31 2015 totaled eur 550 thousand per
     annum increasing to eur 570 thousand per annum for the period commencing june 1 2015 through
     december 31 2015 while markus h√ºllmann was awarded eur 550 thousand per annum in the year
     under review

     in addition the executive board members receive fringe benefits during the year under review the
     latter mainly comprised the value of the company car use in accordance with tax regulations
     accident insurance premiums and  for markus h√ºllmann  the reimbursement of costs incurred for
     the maintenance of two households

     variable components of remuneration
     in addition each member of the executive board receives a variable annual remuneration bonus
     whose level depends on the achievement of specific targets set by the supervisory board in terms of
     a target achievement of 100 percent the level of variable remuneration equals that of the fixed
     remuneration component target bonus to ensure that both positive and negative developments are
     taken into account the proportion of variable remuneration increases or decreases in the event of
     target over or underachievement

     the bonus consists of 3 components the latter comprise both oneyear and multiyear bases of
     assessment each of the 3 components provides for a cap furthermore taken together all 3 bonus
     components applicable to a specific fiscal year are limited to 240 percent of the target bonus overall
     cap at its own discretion the supervisory board takes into account extraordinary events and
     developments indicating that a readjustment of the respective value computed in line with the
     provisions set forth in the contract is appropriate

        individual component weighting of 40 percent
     the individual component of variable remuneration is payable with the next regular salary payment
     following the date of the supervisory board meeting convened to adopt the financial statements for
     the preceding fiscal year its amount is calculated on the basis of 3 to 5 personal annual targets
     determined for the respective fiscal year by the supervisory board when determining these
     individual targets the supervisory board primarily bases its decision on the sustainability of
     corporate governance for instance organic revenue growth relative to global economic growth the
     supervisory boards definition of the individual targets also includes their respective weighting

     under the variable remuneration component the individual component has a weighting of
     40 percent ie 40 percent of the variable remuneration target amount is payable if 100 percent of
     the target set in relation to the individual component is achieved the overall degree of target
     achievement and thus the amount paid out under the individual component are limited to
     200 percent of this target amount cap

after the end of the fiscal year the supervisory board decides on the degree of target achievement
for the year 2015 the supervisory board has ascertained a 1060 percent degree of average target
achievement previous year 1292  for the members of the executive board1
    multiyear component weighting of 40 percent
the multiyear component is payable with the next regular salary payment following the date of the
supervisory board meeting convened to adopt the financial statements for the preceding fiscal year
performance measurement under the multiyear component takes place retrospectively for the previous
3 fiscal years the period of assessment covers the respective fiscal year just ended as well as the two
preceding fiscal years the basis of assessment is tied to key performance indicators embracing a
combination of cash flow aspects the socalled cash flow driver margin cfdm and the return on
capital employed roce

 the cfdm target is a simplified cash flow indicator ebitda minus capital expenditure in
  property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets capex minus change in working
  capital on a 12month average calculated as a ratio of revenue the cfdm actually generated is
  calculated on the basis of average values achieved over the previous three years the degree of
  target achievement results from a comparison between the achieved cfdm and the target value or
  target achievement corridor defined by the supervisory board as for the fiscal year 2015 just like
  the previous year 100 percent of the target is achieved if the groups cfdm during the preceding
  threeyear period averages 8 percent if the cfdm is lower or higher the degree of target
  achievement will go up or down with a cfdm less than or equal to 45 percent being equivalent to
  a target achievement of zero percent while a cfdm greater than or equal to 1325 percent
  represents a maximum target achievement of 250 percent

 the level of the roce component roce return on capital employed which is calculated on the
  basis of average values attained over the previous three years corresponds to the ratio of earnings
  before interest and taxes ebit to the capital employed while excluding goodwill arising on the
  acquisition of the former gea ag by the former metallgesellschaft ag back in 1999 including
  effects attributable to the award proceedings the degree of target achievement depends on the
  actual roce achieved compared with the target value or target achievement corridor of  5
  percentage points defined by the supervisory board as for 2015 just like the previous year
  100 percent of the target is achieved if the groups roce averages 19 percent during the preceding
  threeyear period if the actual roce level is greater than or less than this percentage but within
  the defined corridor of  5 percentage points the degree of target achievement is increased or
  reduced by up to 50 percentage points

the key performance indicators cfdm and roce are adjusted for the impact of acquisitions made in
the fiscal year 2014 or later with respect to acquisitions such adjustment is effected in the year of
firsttime consolidation and in the following fiscal year respectively the adjustment includes all
acquisitions that require the consent of the supervisory board or the presiding committee of the
supervisory board

for calculating the overall degree of target achievement the respective degrees of target achievement
relevant to the individual key performance indicators cfdm and roce are multiplied under the
variable remuneration component the multiyear component has a weighting of 40 percent ie
40 percent of variable remuneration is payable target amount if 100 percent of the target set in relation
to the multiyear component is achieved the overall degree of target achievement and thus the amount
paid out under the multiyear component are limited to 250 percent of this target amount cap

     during the preceding threeyear period an average of 83 percent was achieved for the cfdm key
     performance indicator that is the result of a cfdm of 96 percent in the fiscal year 2013 90 percent in
     the fiscal year 2014 and 63 percent in the fiscal year 2015 thus in 2015 the degree of target
     achievement for the cfdm amounts to 1085 percent previous year 958 percent for the roce key
     performance indicator an average of 200 percent was achieved during the preceding threeyear
     period it is the result of a roce of 221 percent in the fiscal year 2013 226 percent in the fiscal year
     2014 and 152 percent in the fiscal year 2015 thus for the fiscal year 2015 the degree of roce target
     achievement amounts to 1100 percent previous year 1148 percent as to the variable remuneration
     awarded in 2015 the overall degree of target achievement under the multiyear component amounted
     to 1193 percent previous year 1099 percent2
        share price component weighting of 20 percent
     the longterm share price component is payable at the end of a threeyear performance period with
     the next regular salary payment following the date of the supervisory board meeting convened to
     adopt the financial statements for the preceding fiscal year performance measurement relating to the
     longterm share price component is conducted by taking a forwardlooking approach the period of
     assessment covers a threeyear performance period including the relevant fiscal year as well as the
     two subsequent fiscal years

     under the variable remuneration component the longterm share price component has a weighting
     of 20 percent ie 20 percent of variable remuneration is payable target amount if 100 percent of the
     set target is achieved the overall degree of target achievement and thus the amount paid out under
     the longterm share price component is limited to 300 percent of the target amount cap

     performance measurement for the relevant threeyear period is conducted by means of a comparison
     between the performance of gea shares adjusted for dividends and the performance of the
     stoxx europe tmi industrial engineering tmi ie index in which a large number of european
     industrial firms are listed this comparison is computed on the basis of the respective arithmetic
     mean closing prices on the last 20 trading days preceding the start of the threeyear performance
     period 100 percent of the target is attained if the evolution of the daily arithmetic mean closing
     prices of geas share fully ie 100 percent corresponds to the relevant tmi ie performance during the
     threeyear performance period the degree of target achievement increases or decreases by 4 percent
     for each percentage point greater than or less than a performance level of 100 percent in the event of
     outperformance greater than 100 percent the amount paid out rises to a maximum of 300 percent of
     the target amount if the increase in geas share price over the threeyear period is less than
     100 percent of the growth in the tmi ie the amount payable is reduced accordingly down to a
     performance level of 75 percent should gea shares have dropped the supervisory board may still
     award a payment if gea shares have nonetheless outperformed the tmi ie such a decision and the
     level of the amount to be paid out are subject to discretion by the supervisory board

     during the year under review no payment under the longterm share price component was made as
     the latter in a forwardlooking way is measured over a threeyear period the amount paid out under
     the longterm share price component for the fiscal year 2015 is measured over the threeyear period
     between 2015 and 2017 payment is scheduled for the fiscal year 2018 in the year under review the
     2012 tranche in the amount of eur 784 thousand was paid out on the basis of a target achievement
     level of 1368 percent as of december 31 2015 the computed degree of target achievement for the
     2015 tranche amounted to 883 percent while totaling 1166 percent previous year 987 percent for
     the 2014 tranche and 1990 percent for the 2013 tranche previous year 1722 percent3

as the contractual pension commitments made to the members of the executive board had only been
partly protected against insolvency namely in the amount of the sum covered by the pensions
sicherungsverein psv  pension protection fund the supervisory board decided to take out
pension plan reinsurance policies to secure the proportion of the pension commitments not covered
by the psv for the benefit of the individual executive board members in 2014 at the same time the
members of the executive board were granted a capitalization option the level of the capitalization
amount is equivalent to the pension liabilities ascertained by applying the basis of calculation used
for the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements such capitalization option may be
exercised upon retirement but no earlier than age 62 it will be possible to exercise this option in
part or several times any exercise of such capitalization option will entail a corresponding reduction
of entitlements under the contractually guaranteed benefits for surviving dependents

     target achievement to the target amount set for the entire fiscal year the pro rata bonus under the
     multiyear component for the relevant fiscal year is computed by applying the principle of pro rata
     temporis as for annual tranches outstanding under the longterm share price component a
     distinction is made between annual tranches in relation to which the first fiscal year oneyear vesting
     period of the threeyear performance period has not yet passed and annual tranches in relation to
     which the first fiscal year has already passed in the latter case the pro rata bonus is fully vested and
     calculated without applying the principle of pro rata temporis whereupon it will be paid out once the
     threeyear performance period has elapsed if the first fiscal year oneyear vesting period has not yet
     passed the pro rata bonus is ascertained by applying the principle of pro rata temporis ratio of the
     actual period of service attained during the oneyear vesting period to the full relevant oneyear
     vesting period whereupon it will be paid out after the threeyear performance period

     report on risks and opportunities
     risk and opportunity management targets
     geas ability to leverage its growth and earnings potential depends on it using the opportunities that
     arise although this in turn is associated as a matter of principle with business risks taking calculated
     risks is therefore part of geas corporate strategy to meet the objective of sustainably increasing
     enterprise value it is necessary as far as possible to enter into only those risks that are calculable and
     matched by greater opportunities this requires active risk and opportunity management which avoids
     inappropriate risks monitors and manages risks entered into and ensures that opportunities are
     identified and utilized in good time

     geas strategic and mediumterm planning are key components of the way in which it manages
     opportunities and risks these processes are used to prepare decisions on core technologies and
     markets along with the corresponding allocation of resources the objective is to ensure stability by
     diversifying and by concentrating on markets of the future at the same time developments that may
     jeopardize geas continuing existence can be identified at an early stage

     opportunities and risks arising from significant operating decisions  for example whether to take
     on orders or to implement capital expenditure projects  are assessed and hence actively managed by
     the relevant departments and decisionmakers at all group levels in a decisionmaking process that
     takes materiality criteria into account

     overall assessment of the risk position and changes compared with
     the previous year
     the identified risks from operating activities and the negative impact on earnings that could result
     have changed only immaterially as against the previous year as in previous years the structure of
     gea with its regional and industry diversification offers protection to a large extent against
     individual risks clustering into a single risk that could threaten the groups continued existence as a
     going concern in addition gea group is not dependent on individual business partners be they
     either suppliers or customers

     risks in connection with discontinued operations were reduced thanks to further progress in
     completing the lentjes projects the sale of the gea heat exchangers segment resulted in risks in the
     form of financial obligations towards the purchaser

     overall no risks to gea or gea group aktiengesellschaft were identified that alone or in
     combination with other risks could endanger the companys continued existence as a going concern

geas risk management system is based on the management hierarchy risks are reported to the next
highest management level using predefined thresholds

the specific requirements of the groups project business are addressed by risk boards at business
area and group management level before a binding quotation is submitted or an agreement signed
the commercial and contractual terms of potential orders are examined in detail by specialists from
various departments so that risks that cannot be controlled are avoided the risk management system

     therefore already comes into play before risks arise in the form of a critical examination of the
     opportunity and risk profile of quotations no agreement may be signed if the profile is
     inappropriate

     the risk management system not only serves the statutory purpose of identifying existential risks as
     early as possible it also covers all risks that might have a material impact on the financial position
     and results of operations of a business area or of the group as a whole

     additional modules were added to gea groups risk management system in order to systematically
     capture risks and opportunities not covered by the existing systems these make it possible to assess
     risk on a holistic basis

     information is gathered and consolidated across all organizational units via the iterative processes of
     a groupwide risk  chance scorecard first introduced in 2014 the scorecard will be repeated once
     the new organization has been fully implemented to identify risks that could endanger the
     continued existence of gea as a going concern all issues are assessed for their financial materiality
     on a gross basis ie excluding any riskmitigating measures and their probability of occurrence in
     addition the timing less than or more than one year of each risk is individually assessed

     the following criteria are used to determine materiality


     opportunities and risks
                                                                     probability

     this makes it possible to classify both risks and opportunities in accordance with their impact on
     gea issues with shortterm relevance that have a high h materiality and probability rating are
     initially classified as a significant risk or significant opportunity

     in addition the gea demand index gdi is used to collate estimates by gea groups market experts
     of expected short to mediumterm market developments the gdi makes it possible to obtain an
     early indication of positive or negative market developments in the industries and regions that are
     relevant for gea

     the data gathered using the risk  chance scorecard and the gdi is processed along with other
     internal and external information in a scenario and sensitivity analysis which simulates the potential
     impact on the groups liquidity see page 94

     adequate provisions have been recognized for all identifiable risks arising from the groups operating
     activities provided that the recognition criteria for liabilities have been met the following section

provides details of existing risks risks that are not yet known or currently regarded as insignificant
may also have an adverse effect on business activities

internal control system
geas internal control system ics is based on the coso framework and comprises the risk
management system rms as well as other principles measures and rules other components of the
ics while the rms aims at identifying and classifying risks the components comprising the rest of
the ics serve primarily to prevent or mitigate risk using control measures the internal audit
function is another component of the ics

the rms comprises principles measures and rules relating to the early risk recognition system in
accordance with section 912 of the aktiengesetz aktg  german stock corporation act as well as
those relating to other components of the risk management system in the other components of the
ics a distinction is made between principles measures and rules that are related or unrelated to
financial reporting

geas ics relevant for financial reporting encompasses all principles measures and rules that ensure
the proper approval and recording of business transactions for monthly quarterly and annual
financial statements the goal of the implemented ics is to ensure reliable financial reporting
compliance with the relevant laws and standards and the costeffectiveness of business workflows

in addition to gea group aktiengesellschaft all group companies are integrated into the ics

the following key principles of geas ics must be applied in all business functions clearly defined
areas of responsibility the separation of functions in all areas of activity dual signature policies
compliance with guidelines instructions and procedural requirements manuals the obligation to
obtain comparative offers before awarding contracts protection of data from unauthorized access
and the holding of training sessions to ensure uniform procedures within the group

key measures and rules that are relevant for financial reporting and are designed to ensure uniform
accounting at all subsidiaries are accounting and account allocation manuals a uniform chart of
accounts consolidation and calculation manuals the approval of entries using the dual control
principle and the fact that certain entries can only be made by selected persons to prevent errors
standardized it systems are used in geas accounting financial control and finance functions in all
group companies all guidelines and it systems are updated on a continuous basis to reflect legal and
business requirements

compliance with the principles measures and rules set out in the ics as described above is
monitored systematically this takes the form of regular reviews by geas internal audit function
which reports directly to the executive board and regularly submits reports to the audit committee
the results enable the elimination of defects identified at the companies reviewed and the ongoing
enhancement of the ics in the group

overall the ics aims to ensure the early identification assessment and management of those risks
and opportunities that could materially influence the companys ability to achieve its strategic
operating financial and compliancerelated objectives

     legal risks
     legal risks are not quantified in detail since disclosing the specific probability of occurrence could
     have a material effect on the groups position in current litigation or other legal disputes

     d√∂rries scharmann ag insolvency proceedings
     an action brought by the insolvency administrator of d√∂rries scharmann ag against gea group
     aktiengesellschaft is pending at the d√ºsseldorf regional court the former metallgesellschaft ag
     the legal predecessor to gea group aktiengesellschaft held an interest in schiess ag which later
     became d√∂rries scharmann ag on the basis of that interest the insolvency administrator is
     asserting various claims under company law in particular for equity substitution which amount to
     approximately eur 18 million plus possible interest gea group aktiengesellschaft considers the
     asserted claims to be unfounded and will continue to defend itself against all such demands

     general
     further claims or official investigations have been or may be instituted against gea companies as a
     result of earlier business disposals and operating activities

     adequate provisions have been recognized for all risks arising from both the legal disputes described
     above and other legal disputes being pursued by gea in the course of its ordinary operating
     activities however the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of
     certainty it is therefore possible that the conclusion of the proceedings may result in income or
     expenses if the amounts that have been set aside for them are higher or lower than required

     performance risks
     the performance risks presented below can take a wide variety of forms the elements of the gea
     risk management system are designed to help identify emerging risks before they materialize so that
     appropriate measures can be implemented on a casebycase basis to avoid negative effects on the
     groups financial position and results of operations as a rule potential business performance risks
     are minimized by avoiding significant dependencies and ensuring a balanced mix of fixed and
     flexible capacities

     geas sales markets have a diverse product and customer structure this diversification moderates
     the impact on total demand of fluctuations in demand in specific submarkets however the food
     industry is the main focus of the business a significant decline in demand for food and beverages
     would have a material impact on geas financial position and results of operations gea considers
     the probability of a global decline in demand to be low this risk is rated as medium overall

     a significant proportion of geas business consists of projects that depend on the financing available
     to geas customers a general decline in demand shifts in currency parities or a credit squeeze could
     make it more difficult to implement such projects for the same reason existing orders could be
     deferred or even canceled if such risks were to occur on a global level they would have a material

                  combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




impact on geas financial position and results of operations the probability of such risks occurring
globally is considered to be low this risk is classified as medium overall due to geas diversified
positioning in particular

countryspecific conflict situations that could give rise to risks for the group are continually observed
as part of risk management however the potential risks arising from such situations are difficult to
quantify however no material impact on the groups results of operations is anticipated this risk is
rated as medium overall

on the sales side future prices will depend to a considerable extent on general economic trends any
fall in capacity utilization in the industry could also have a significant negative impact on price levels
and therefore on the financial position and results of operations of gea thanks to the groups
regional and industrial diversification the probability of such a risk is considered to be low this
issue is rated as a medium risk overall

gea processes a number of materials such as stainless steel especially as part of processed products
purchase prices for these metals may fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions long
term supply agreements are entered into with selected suppliers in order to lock in the procurement
prices used as the basis for costing orders however the potential risks arising from such situations
are difficult to quantify with respect to procurement current expectations are that prices for key
materials will not increase the risk is rated as medium overall

longterm engineering orders are a significant element of geas business some of these contracts
entail particular risks as they involve assuming a significant portion of the risk associated with the
projects completion in addition they may provide for warranty obligations that remain in force for
several years after the projects acceptance technical problems quality problems at subcontractors
and missed deadlines may lead to cost overruns there is therefore an extensive risk management
system in place at group management and business area level to closely monitor orderrelated risks
this comes into play before binding quotations are submitted adequate provisions have been
recognized for all foreseeable risks in this area this could give rise to both risks and opportunities in
relation to the financial position and results of operations as a whole these issues are rated as a
medium risk

geas business processes are highly dependent on information technology the failure or malfunction of
critical systems could result in risks relating to confidentiality availability and integrity and key
business processes could be compromised gea protects its it systems against unauthorized access
to the extent that this is economically feasible the relevant security systems are updated on an
ongoing basis this issue is classified as a medium risk overall

furthermore macroeconomic trends are deemed to pose a risk to the company if a downturn in the
economy leads to a reduction in order intake to below the level of the previous fiscal year this could
have a negative impact on earnings due to capacity underutilization and capacity adjustment
measures thanks to the groups regional and industry diversification and the fact that it is

                        combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




     structured for flexibility the probability of this significant risk occurring is considered to be low this
     issue is classified as a medium risk overall

     as contractually agreed defined risks relating to selected orders remained with the group following
     the sale of the former lentjes division the remaining risks are rated as low overall

     the sale of the gea heat exchangers segment resulted in risks in the form of financial obligations
     towards the purchaser these relate to contractual warranties and indemnifications as well as risk
     sharing for major projects this issue is assessed as a medium risk overall with a low probability of
     occurrence

     dedicated and qualified employees are a critical success factor for gea gea has various staff policy
     measures in place to counter the risk that it will be unable to fill vacant positions adequately or that it
     will lose skilled employees the measures aim to position gea as an attractive employer and foster
     employees longterm loyalty to the group see page 54 f the probability of this significant risk
     occurring is considered to be low this issue is rated as a medium risk overall

     acquisition and integration risks
     acquisitions and internal company reorganizations entail risks resulting from the integration of
     employees processes technologies and products it is possible therefore that the aims of the
     measures in question will not be achieved at all or within the timeframe envisaged moreover such
     transactions may give rise to substantial administrative and other expenses portfolio measures may
     also result in the need for additional finance and may impact negatively on financing requirements
     and the financing structure these risks are countered by a structured integration concept and close
     supervision by internal experts as well as specific training measures this issue is rated as a medium
     risk overall

     environmental risk
     several properties in our portfolio entail risks relating to historic environmental contamination and
     mining damage primarily as a result of earlier business activities these risks are countered through
     appropriate measures and supervision by internal and external specialists adequate provisions were
     recognized for the measures in 2015 this could give rise to both risks and opportunities in relation to
     the financial position and results of operations their probability is regarded as medium and their
     materiality as moderate

     financial risks

     principles of financial risk management
     the executive board has put in place an effective set of guidelines to monitor and thus largely limit
     or hedge financial risks throughout the group the objectives with regard to protecting assets
     eliminating gaps in security and improving efficiency in identifying and analyzing risks are clearly
     defined as well as the relevant organizational structures powers and responsibilities the guidelines
     are based on the principles of system security the separation of functions transparency and
     immediate documentation

     gea is exposed to currency interest rate commodity price credit and liquidity risk in the course of
     its ordinary activities because it operates worldwide financial risk management aims to reduce this

                  combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




risks through the appropriate use of derivative and nonderivative hedging instruments the groups
financial risks are quantified in section 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements see
pages 152 ff

based on a gross assessment the financial risks described below are considered in principle to be
both considerable and probable for gea these risks are therefore rated as high overall

currency risk
because gea operates internationally its cash flows are denominated not only in euros but also in a
number of other currencies particularly us dollars hedging the resulting currency risk is a key
element of risk management

the uniform group guidelines for central currency management used within gea require all group
companies to hedge foreign currency items as they arise in order to fix prices on the basis of hedging
rates currency risks are hedged for recognized hedged items unrecognized firm commitments and
highly probable forecast transactions the hedging periods are determined by the maturity of the
hedged items and are usually up to 12 months but in exceptional cases may exceed that period
significantly nevertheless changes in exchange rates may affect sales opportunities outside the
eurozone

affiliated group companies based in the eurozone are obliged to tender to geas central treasury and
corporate finance unit all outstanding exposures relating to transactions in goods and services in
major transaction currencies most of these exposures are passed on directly to banks at matching
maturities depending on the hedging objective of the derivatives and the related accounting
treatment they may also be hedged as part of a portfolio the hedging of financial transactions and
transactions conducted by subsidiaries outside the eurozone is also closely coordinated with the
central treasury and corporate finance unit

interest rate risk
because gea operates worldwide liquidity is raised and invested in the international money and
capital markets in different currencies but mainly in euros and at different maturities the resulting
financial liabilities and investments are exposed to interest rate risk which must be assessed and
managed by central interest rate management derivative financial instruments may be used on a
casebycase basis to hedge interest rate risk and reduce the interest rate volatility and financing costs
of the hedged items only the central treasury and corporate finance unit is permitted to enter into
such interest rate hedges

credit risk
financial instruments are exposed to credit risk in that the other party to the contract may fail to
fulfill its obligations the counterparty limit system used by geas central treasury and corporate
finance unit aims to continuously assess and manage counterparty default risk a maximum risk
limit has been defined for each counterparty which in most cases is derived from the ratings from
recognized credit rating agencies and credit default swaps cdss appropriate action is taken if the
individual limit is exceeded




                                          gea annual report 2015                                             93

                       combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




     the financial standing of potential customers is ascertained via an internal risk board procedure
     before orders are accepted active receivables management including nonrecourse factoring
     nonrecourse financing and credit insurance is also performed in the case of export transactions
     confirmed and unconfirmed letters of credit are used alongside sureties guarantees and cover notes
     including from export credit agencies such as euler hermes an addition to local monitoring by the
     subsidiary gea oversees the main credit risks at group management level so that any accumulation
     of risk can be better managed

     since trade receivables are usually due from a large number of customers in different sectors and
     regions there is no concentration of risk valuation allowances take account of specific credit risks

     so as to reduce the credit risk involved derivative financial instruments are only entered into with
     reputable financial institutions whose creditworthiness has been classified as reliable and is
     continuously monitored under the counterparty limit system described above

     the maximum exposure for the financial assets is limited to their carrying amount

     liquidity risk
     gea is exposed to liquidity risk in that it may be unable to meet payment obligations because it has
     insufficient cash funds at its disposal the central treasury and corporate finance unit is responsible
     for managing this risk cash funds are arranged and credit lines managed on the basis of a multiyear
     financial plan and a rolling monthbymonth cash forecast the funds are then made available to the
     companies by group management cash pools have been established in a growing number of
     countries in order to optimize the use of cash funds and borrowing within gea to mitigate liquidity
     risk gea will continue to use various financing instruments in the future so as to diversify its
     sources of funding and stagger maturities

     the impact of potential risk scenarios on changes in liquidity is also simulated all internal risk
     management information and internal and external information on potential market and other
     external risks is taken into account on the basis of this the executive board and supervisory board
     have agreed strict rules regarding the level of cash and longterm credit lines to be held to cover
     potential liquidity risk

     tax risks
     the applicable national tax legislation may affect the use of loss carryforwards and thus the
     recoverability of the deferred taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements and current
     taxation furthermore future changes to the ownership structure could significantly reduce or even
     render impossible the use of german loss carryforwards section 8c of the k√∂rperschaftsteuergesetz
     kstg  german corporate income tax act the ability to use us loss carryforwards could also be
     restricted in the case of certain changes to the ownership structure of gea group aktiengesellschaft
     under irc section 382 limitation on net operating loss carryforwards following an ownership change

                  combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




moreover in germany and abroad there is considerable uncertainty regarding future changes to and
the application of tax legislation as a result of tighter public sector finances the resulting pressure
for reform and tangibly greater scrutiny by the tax authorities

the tax risks presented could have a material effect on geas financial position and results of
operations the occurrence of material negative effects is considered to be relatively unlikely

opportunities

overall assessment of opportunities and changes compared
with the previous year
geas end markets offer a variety of opportunities for positive business performance over the long
term a key task of the opportunity and risk management system is to systematically evaluate both
internal and external information in order to identify opportunities at an early stage and appropriately
assess the potential they offer see page 87 f specific measures are then developed to enable us to
convert opportunities into actual economic success

the identified opportunities from operating activities and the additional positive impact on earnings
that could result have not changed significantly as against the previous year

planning of the groups economic development is based on certain assumptions regarding the
development of the performance parameters described below if these parameters develop more
positively than expected overall this could have a corresponding effect on geas financial position
and results of operations

performance opportunities
gea is entering fiscal year 2016 with an unchanged high order backlog further growth is expected in
the more rapidly expanding asian markets in the medium term gea will further expand its presence
in these regions and thus participate in the growth of these markets

if the expected moderate growth in the global economy materializes geas continued focus on the
food end market will allow it benefit more than average especially in growth markets

in the area of food process technology geas growth will be driven not only by an increase in the
standard of living and the trend toward highquality foods but also by the expected rise in
production and quality standards as well as innovative process improvements and new product
developments

geas new structure has been in place since june 8 2015 the group now boasts much flatter
hierarchies and is also much closer to its local customers thanks to the uniformity of its national
organizations this more prominent positioning of the portfolio as a whole coupled with intensified
service business will promote additional profitable growth while nurturing customer loyalty this
will continue to further strengthen and expand the sustainable competitiveness of gea until 2020
and beyond the savings of at least eur 125 million expected to be made from the fit for 2020
program as from 2017 do not however take into account the potential for generating greater revenue
through the new much more uniform lines of contact with our customers in addition the new
structure is likely to furnish much greater crossselling opportunities as a basis for increasing sales
among existing customers while tapping into new customer groups




                                          gea annual report 2015                                            95

                       combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




     the former relatively decentralized group structure featuring segmentation by technology meant
     that procurement was also organized on a highly individual basis the new structure in which the
     development and manufacturing of products and the provision of process solutions have been
     bundled in two new business areas will give rise to optimization potential in the future the
     company sees opportunities especially in the harmonization of material categories the clustering of
     suppliers and through the expansion of centrally coordinated purchasing processes

     gea sees further potential in the structure of its present global production network here too the
     previous decentralized approach served to optimize production capacities in the individual segments
     thanks to the new group structure it will now be possible to centralize the management and control
     of capital expenditure to a greater degree than before and this could give rise to additional
     significant savings

     geas indepth understanding of its customers production processes is a cornerstone of its success
     increasing scarcity of resources means that ever more efficient use needs to be made of raw materials
     and energy in addition end consumers rising demands require the implementation of higher quality
     standards in production processes growing awareness of the environment means we must meet
     more stringent standards on co2 emissions for example this creates additional opportunities for
     gea by focusing on research and development activities on environmentally friendly technologies
     and production processes and thus offer specialist solutions

     the acquisition in 2015 of comas see page 37 saw gea enter the pastries market the creation of an
     application center bakery in the new structure underscores the companys increasing focus on this
     area of industry further acquisitions see page 63 could see gea expand its competence portfolio as
     in this case and thus achieve market leadership in new fields of activity as the groups acquisition
     strategy is clearly focused on sophisticated process technology for the food industry these
     acquisitions may well bring about a further increase in group profitability

     gea considers the probability of the performance opportunities exceeding the planning assumptions
     and therefore having a material positive impact on net assets financial position and results of
     operations to be medium overall

report on expected developments
geas report on expected developments takes into account relevant facts and events that were
known at the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements and that could influence
the future development of its business

economic environment in 2016

global economy
as described in the section on the macroeconomic environment in the report on the economic
position see page 35 f gea as a global engineering company considers global growth in gross
domestic product gdp and the corresponding imf forecasts to be key benchmarks for its own
performance

in the january 2016 update to its world economic outlook the imf once again downscaled its forecast
for global economic growth in 2016 against its october 2015 estimates according to the forecast the
global economy is set to grow by 34 percent in 2016 in the following year the global economy is again
expected to pick up slightly achieving a growth rate of 36 percent the forecast growth rates for 2016
and 2017 are both 02 percentage points below the figures published last october
according to the imf experts the biggest risks are currently slowing growth in china tighter us
monetary policies coupled with a strong dollar and the possible aggravation of current geopolitical
tensions

growth in the industrialized nations
the imf is predicting stable growth of 21 percent for the industrialized nations in 2016 and 2017 as
regards both germany and the eurozone economy as a whole the imf is looking at growth of 17
percent for this year and 2017

since the original october forecast the imf has reduced its estimates for the us economy by 02
percentage points twice with the strength of the dollar posing a major challenge to the us economy
the imf is now predicting annual growth of 26 percent for 2016 and 2017

growth in the emerging markets
by predicting economic growth of 43 percent in 2016 and 47 percent in 2017 for the emerging
markets and the industrialized nations the iwf has reduced its original october estimate by 02
percentage points on two occasions

with regard to the chinese economy the iwf is anticipating a decline in growth from 69 percent in
2015 to 63 percent in 2016 and down to 60 percent in 2017 this is in line with previous expectations

as far as the russian economy goes the imf is predicting negative growth of 10 percent in 2016 but
a recovery to 10 percent in 2017 thus the imf has significantly adjusted its forecast for the russian
economy in 2016 down 04 percentage points compared with the fall forecast the forecast for the
russian economy in 2017 remained unchanged

                       combined group management report  report on expected developments




     growth in the latin american countries is also expected to stall in 2016 the imf expecting these
     economies to contract to 03 percent a further 11 percentage points down on the october 2015
     figure even if economic growth in latin america recovers to 16 percent in 2017 the latest estimates
     are still well below those of october 2015

     growth in the customer industries

     the following trends are expected for geas key applications based on external studies

     food
     the consumption of packaged food will continue to grow at a moderate rate driven by slight increases in
     consumption in the asia pacific region as well as in the middle east and africa it is also expected
     that the consumption of bakery goods will increase too

     dairy farming
     milk prices are set to remain volatile in 2016 with no prospect of recovery until the middle of the
     year as such the financial situation of dairy farmers is unlikely to improve until that time at the
     earliest as a result a significant increase in the investment appetite of the northern hemisphere
     markets usaeu which are especially relevant to gea  is not expected to materialize before 2017
     in the medium to long term however the situation in the global dairy market is expected to improve
     due to increases in the consumption of dairy products

     dairy processing
     global milk consumption is set to increase slightly over the next few years a trend driven by
     increasing demand for dairy products in europe and in north and south america as before growth
     will be strongest in the asia pacific region albeit at a lower level than in the past in global terms
     especially the consumption of yogurt and fermented dairy products is set to increase

     beverages
     global beverage consumption is set to grow faster over the next few years than in the previous three
     the coming years are expected to see a moderate increase in the consumption of both alcoholic
     beverages and soft drinks while growth in demand for soft drinks in asia is not expected to be quite
     as vibrant as it has been in recent years demand in eastern europe in particular is expected to increase
     in the next few years moreover demand for juices and carbonated soft drinks  an important market
     for gea  is expected to increase more strongly in the future than in the last three years

     pharma
     spending on medicinal products will continue to rise with growth rates in this market increasing
     again as compared with the years 2012 to 2015 the main reason for the marked rise is increased drug
     spending in the socalled pharmerging markets eg china brazil russia turkey and india as well
     as in germany france uk italy and spain all told it can be assumed therefore that investment
     outlay in the pharma industry will continue to rise

                  combined group management report  report on expected developments




chemical
the manufacture of petrochemical products is set to increase further in the coming years exceeding
the growth rates of the last three years and giving rise to the predicted further increase in investment
activity the main driver of this upward trend has been increases in production in both china and the
gulf states

economic environment for gea
geas planning for the current 2016 fiscal year assumes that demand in its sales markets will be
moderately higher than the levels seen in 2015

the groups enduring success is founded on a number of major global trends

1 the continuous growth in the global population
2 the growing middle class
3 the growing demand for highquality foods and beverages
4 the increasing demand for production methods that are efficient and conserve valuable resources

the united nations assumes that the worlds population which currently stands at more than 73 billion
people will rise over the coming years by around 80 million people per year see world population
prospects the 2015 revision world urbanization prospects 2014 the worlds population is set to
grow to 8 billion by 2023 this means that in future significantly more food will have to be produced
on more or less the same cultivation area for this reason the methods and production processes
used must become much more efficient  which is why innovative process technology is needed

linked to this growth is an increasing degree of urbanization the number of people living in towns
and cities rose from 746 million in 1950 to 39 billion in 2014 this means that more than half of the
worlds population now lives in urban areas this figure is set to expand by a further 25 billion
people by 2050 particularly in asia and africa in addition more and more foods must be preserved
for longer and be easier to transport in order to secure the necessary supplies for metropolitan areas
and to maintain world trade here as well only stateoftheart technologies can provide the capacity
needed to cope with rising demand

another factor is that as the middle class grows so will the number of people who will be able to
afford processed foods beverages and dairy products this is equally true for pharmaceutical
products which must meet the needs of an increasingly healthconscious population
against the backdrop of the trends in the global economy and the food industry presented in this
chapter and the impact of the various megatrends on its direct sales markets gea is expecting
growing demand for highquality foods and linked to this ongoing high levels of investment in the
food industry additionally gea is anticipating sustained customer interest in process optimization
for improving efficiency productivity energy usage and plant availability which its technologies are
able to provide

with regard to commodity prices the world bank see commodity markets outlook october 2015
expects the prices of all industrial goods energy metals and minerals as well as basic agricultural
products to remain at their 2015 levels in 2016

the company does not believe that customer project finance will be significantly affected by
uncertainty in the capital markets

                        combined group management report  report on expected developments




      the proportion of geas revenue accounted for by the food industry in 2016 is expected to remain at
      its current high level from a regional perspective too gea is not anticipating any significant change
      in the current breakdown of revenue in 2016 as against the past fiscal year

      business outlook
      the forecast is made under the assumption that there there will be no further slowdown in global
      economic growth and no significant exchange rate fluctuations acquisitions made in 2016 are not
      included in the calculation of the key performance indicators the figures are also adjusted for non
      recurring items expected savings from group restructuring are already included in the forecast

      revenue
      gea is aiming to generate moderate revenue growth in 2016 this forecast is largely due to the lower
      growth in capital goods that is expected in light of lower growth rates in the emerging markets
      although the significant fall in oil prices will generate growth momentum  with the exception of the
      oil processing industry and in the oil producing countries  the necessary structural reforms in some
      countries and the ongoing high geopolitical risk are perceived as having a negative impact on global
      economic growth

      earnings
      we are expecting operating ebitda of between eur 645 million and eur 715 million previous
      year eur 621 million for the current fiscal year

      cash flow driver margin
      with respect to our operating cash flow drivers ie the net amount of operating ebitda the change
      in working capital and capital expenditure we are aiming for a ratio to revenue of between 100 percent
      and 110 percent in 2016

      further expectations

      acquisitions
      the strategy of acquiring companies to open up new markets for gea or specifically expand geas
      product portfolio in existing markets will remain unchanged and valid this will enable us to provide
      our customers with an everbroader range of services from a single source

      dividend
      the executive board and supervisory board will propose a dividend of eur 080 per share for 2015
      to the annual general meeting this would represent a total dividend volume eur 1540 million this
      dividend payment would also be in line with our objective of distributing between 40 and 50 percent
      of the consolidated profit to the shareholders

                  combined group management report  report on expected developments




summary
all told provided that there is no further slowdown in the global economy gea expects the group as
a whole to record moderate growth the continual increase in profitability together with the ongoing
focus on liquidity generation should help to ensure that we have the financial leeway to successfully
implement the strategic growth targets with regard to the distribution ratio our objective is to keep
distributing between 40 and 50 percent of the consolidated profit to the shareholders

      performance of gea shares on the capital markets
      in 2015 as in the previous year developments on the international capital markets were dominated
      by the continuing expansionary monetary policy measures taken by the central banks as well as by
      economic and in particular geopolitical volatility the stock markets continued their rally into 2015
      and on toward the end of the first quarter setting a string of record highs in the process the dax
      reached an alltime high of 12375 points on april 10 while the mdax hit the highest mark in its
      history 21623 points three days later on april 13 in particular economic data from china put the
      brakes on the stock markets in the second and third quarters prompting the various indexes to fall to
      their lowest levels in the year so far the dax and the stoxx  europe tmi industrial engineering
      hit their lowest points on september 24 9428 points and september 28 31298 points respectively
      while the mdax hit its low for the year 16700 points on january 6 in the final quarter of the year

      below their respective highs for the year

      the dax ended the year on 10743 points a rise of 96 percent over the course of the year the mdax
      closed the year on december 30 on 20775 points a rise of 227 percent the stoxx  europe tmi
      industrial engineering index closed the year on 35064 points a rise of 28 percent over the course of
      the year

      geas share price increased slightly over the course of the fiscal year in a market environment
      dominated by strong economic and political factors as the stock markets surged so did geas shares

      eur 4682 on april 10 the highest price of the last two decades profittaking and general market
      corrections affecting cyclical equities subsequently saw gea shares reach their lowest point in the
      year of eur 3134 on september 24 in the final quarter gea shares recovered to close the year at

shareholder structure
as of december 31 2015 gea group aktiengesellschaft did not hold any treasury shares meaning
that the number of outstanding shares was unchanged at the end of the year at 192495476 this led
to a market capitalization of eur 72 billion as of the end of 2015 compared with eur 70 billion in
december 2014 a 22 percent increase the monthly index ranking of all listed german companies in
the dax mdax sdax and tecdax published by deutsche b√∂rse on december 30 ranked gea

dividend proposal
the executive board and supervisory board of gea group aktiengesellschaft will propose to the
annual general meeting on april 20 2016 that a dividend of eur 080 be paid for fiscal year 2015 as
a result the distribution ratio is in line with the target of distributing between 40 and 50 percent of
the consolidated profit to the shareholders this represents a dividend yield of at least 21 percent on
the share price of eur 3740 on december 30 2015

the dividend will be paid from the contribution account for tax purposes section 27 of the k√∂rper
schaftsteuergesetz kstg  german corporate income tax act and therefore without deduction of
investment income tax and the solidarity surcharge in the case of shareholders in germany the
dividend is not subject to current taxation in the year of payment the opinion of the german tax
authorities see also the federal ministry of finance bmf circular dated december 22 2009
paragraph 92 is that the payment of dividends from the contribution account for tax purposes
constitutes a repayment of shareholder contributions which results in a retrospective reduction in
the cost of the shares this can lead to the imposition of higher capital gains taxes if the shares are
sold at a later date

of corporate governance and nearly fully complies with the recommendations of the german

compliance is geas top priority this is why all gea managers and employees must comply with the
law and the relevant guidelines wrongful or even criminal actions as well as violations of internal
corporate guidelines will not be tolerated gea has drawn up detailed guidelines  in particular an
anticorruption and a competition guideline  that come with binding guidelines for action
periodic training and monitoring help avoid or detect noncompliant conduct at an early stage in this
context employees may be instrumental in drawing attention to potential compliance violations

by means of the socalled integrity system employees  including external third parties for instance
business partners  are given the possibility of directly reporting severe compliance issues or
violations of the codes of conduct  principles of social responsibility via an internetbased system
in this respect gea attaches importance to an open corporate culture

the integrity system offers an additional communication channel if the standard reporting lines fail
to apply for instance this may be the case if immediate action is required in the event of gross
misconduct this system also allows anonymous reporting as far as this is permitted in the country in
question nonetheless this system shall not constitute a general platform for complaints therefore
it only comprises reporting categories that embrace a substantial risk to the company its employees
and all other stakeholders

security to enjoy an acceptable standard of living in many countries however the impact of
demographic change increased life expectancy and high unemployment rates places a growing
financial burden on state pension systems as a result private and in particular company pension
schemes will play an increasingly significant role in closing such future pensions gaps thus the
company provides an efficient pension scheme for all its employees

in 2015 geas executive pension scheme was transformed into a defined contribution system

gea also offers an attractive performancerelated pension scheme to employees below senior
management level in germany for instance this is based on an employeefinanced deferred

      compensation plan employees are given the possibility of waiving part of their monthly salary and
      contributing this amount to the pension plan deferred compensation if an employee chooses this
      option gea tops up this basic employee contribution with an additional employer contribution the
      latter is financed by the company and performancerelated

      healthcare
      healthy employees are more productive more reliable and more motivated thus a healthconscious
      workforce also promotes the longterm and sustainable development of a company for this reason
      gea supports its employees with a variety of active healthcare offerings

      the program designed to promote employee health comprises a broad range of measures to prevent
      illness inter alia they include cancer screening stop smoking seminars workplace ergonomics
      training as well as fitness meals in staff canteens moreover the company addresses safety issues
      safe winter driving or walking how to get to work by bike as well as information on noise protection
      against cuts or on how to keep the workplace clean and tidy to name but a few examples apart from
      these campaigns 2015 also saw some new topics like a healthy diet

      healthcare coaching
      in special development assessment centers supported by external coaches employees obtain
      comprehensive information on the health benefits of physical exercise fitness and a proper diet
      where possible this theoretical information is supplemented by practical exercises all preventive
      measures are tailored to the actual living and working circumstances of the employees concerned in
      addition the group also offers individual coaching with fitness tests or health analyses

      socially committed
      as a global enterprise gea is also involved in a host of local projects undertaken outside its own
      companies where the local population directly benefits from the support provided by the
      company in many different ways gea and its employees make their contribution to help others

      ecologically sustainable
      sustainability in the ecological sense is based on the principle of protecting nature and conserving its
      limited resources in this context geas innovative products make an important contribution since
      in the world of process technology the days when ecology and economy pursued conflicting interests
      are long gone by using gea machinery components systems and plants our customers advance the
      cause of climate protection but also within the company environmental protection is accorded its
      rightful place

      environmental protection at gea
      geas key environmental objectives focus on the prevention of adverse environmental impacts for
      instance by reducing the levels of energy consumption waste and emissions identifying the main
      environmental parameters at a local level gea analyzes their significance and influence on products
      and services for the purpose of deriving measures for improvement the environmental parameters
      subject to monitoring include

         emissions
         energy consumption
         hazardous goods handling including waterpolluting agents such as acids and alkalis
         waste

efficient products

the following examples show the savings potential for a variety of resources which is provided by
geas machinery components systems and plants

zerowater dairy processing plant

      supporting brewery customers in upgrading their plants to stateoftheart technology in terms of
      energy consumption gea is offering bespoke energy supply strategies that usually embrace an
      energy storage system

      geas energy storage system allows the transfer of energy from the wort kettle vapours to the
      following brew instead of releasing the vapors into the atmosphere they are condensed with the
      respective energy being transferred into the water this water is used in the following brew to heat
      the wort from its filtration temperature of around 77c to approx 9495c as a result a substantial
      proportion of the heat energy required by cuttingedge systems is no longer generated on the basis of
      fossil fuels but obtained by means of a heat recovery process this energy storage process enables
      our customers to realize primary energy savings of between 20 and 50 percent for brewhouse
      operations

      in brewhouses situated in the equatorial zone the ambient water temperature is typically between
      20c and 37c during the summer which requires a twostage cooling process at any rate the hot
      water production in the wort cooler exceeds the amount of water required by the brewery as a whole
      the resulting excess hot water must be disposed of via the sewerage system with a loss of drinking
      quality water and of the energy contained in the 80c hot water apart from storage systems for
      energy conversion that rely on closed water cycles gea is also offering opencycle systems equipped
      with two water tanks for temperature levels of 79c and 98c respectively subject to the quality of
      the raw materials employed and dependent on further process parameters the water management
      process developed by gea allows a 35 to 100 percent reduction in hot water losses within the
      framework of a project conducted in south america the solution provided by gea has helped
      salvage around 100 m¬≥ of hot water per day that no longer need to be disposed of

in developing this seventh generation of ecospin technology combined with zero emissions and a
reduced level of water and energy consumption geas filling specialists have made substantial progress
in various fields

step number one embraced geas optimization of the use of peracetic acid ppa as a sterilization
medium to ensure that only a minimum amount of chemicals are required for achieving the
necessary sterilization effect in a second step rinsing time per bottle was reduced to one second only
which  in turn  significantly cuts the amount of sterile water used during this stage

at the end of a production run the remaining paa undergoes a neutralizing process to make sure
that the water can be safely used for cleaning within the plant this reduces water consumption at
production level and prevents the release of chemicals into the environment

paa vapors generated while the bottles are sterilized by means of a chemical solution are subjected
to a vacuum extraction process and freed from all chemical residues this enhances the working
environment of the operators while making sure that no harmful chemicals are released into the
atmosphere

                    notes to the consolidated financial statements  reporting principles




unless otherwise stated the new standards and interpretations have been endorsed by the eu

gea group is currently examining the effects of the revised accounting standards on the consolidated
financial statements and will determine the date of initial application

ifrs 9 financial instruments  issued by the iasb in july 2014
the iasb issued ifrs 9 financial instruments in november 2009 completing the first part of a
threephase project to replace ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement the
new standard initially introduced uniform requirements on the measurement and classification of
financial instruments ifrs 9 was reissued in october 2010 to incorporate new requirements on
accounting for financial liabilities the requirements on accounting for financial liabilities and the
derecognition of financial assets and liabilities were largely carried over unchanged from ias 39 the
amendments to ifrs 9 and ifrs 7 published in december 2011 changed the mandatory effective date
of ifrs 9 and modified the relief from restating comparative periods and the associated disclosures
in ifrs 7 the version of ifrs 9 issued in november 2013 amended the standard to include a new
general hedge accounting model in july 2014 the iasb issued the fourth and final version of ifrs 9
which now also includes the new requirements on the recognition of impairment losses and limited
changes to the classification and measurement of financial assets the final version superseded all
previous versions of ifrs 9

the main new requirements of ifrs 9 on the recognition and measurement of financial instruments
are described below

classification and measurement of financial assets
in the future there will only be two classification and measurement categories for financial assets at
amortized cost or at fair value financial assets at amortized cost comprise those financial assets that
give rise solely to payments of principal and interest at specified dates and are also held within a
business model for managing financial assets whose objective is to hold those financial assets and
collect the associated contractual cash flows all other financial assets are classified as at fair value
under certain circumstances a fair value option is available for financial assets falling under the first
category on initial recognition as at present

depending on the business model in which they are held changes in financial assets belonging to the
fair value category must be recognized in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income there is
an optional right to measure certain equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive
income in this case dividend income from these assets is recognized in profit or loss

accounting for financial liabilities
with regard to accounting for financial liabilities the most important change relates to the presentation
of changes in value of financial liabilities measured at fair value depending on the business model in
which they are held changes in financial assets belonging to the fair value category must be
recognized in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income

hedge accounting
the introduction of the new general hedge accounting model is intended to align hedge accounting
more closely with the risk management system the new model opens up further options to apply
hedge accounting in particular groups of hedged items that meet the qualifying criteria individually
as well as net positions and nil net positions may now be designated in a hedging relationship
generally every financial instrument carried at fair value is suitable to be a hedged item




                                          gea annual report 2015                                             129

                          notes to the consolidated financial statements  reporting principles




      new requirements are being introduced in relation to the effectiveness of hedging relationships
      stipulation of the ranges for the measurement of effectiveness is being dispensed with so that a
      retrospective effectiveness test no longer has to be performed the prospective effectiveness test as
      well as recognition of any ineffectiveness continue to be required

      a hedging relationship may only be terminated when the defined conditions for this are met this
      means that it is mandatory to continue hedging relationships if risk management objectives remain
      unchanged

      enhanced disclosures are required in relation to the risk management strategy the effects of risk
      management on future cash flows as well as the effects of hedge accounting on the financial
      statements

      provided the conditions and qualitative characteristics continue to be met hedging relationships do
      not have to be terminated as a result of the transition from ias 39 to ifrs 9 the existing
      requirements under ias 39 may also as an option continue to be applied under ifrs 9

      new impairment model
      under the new model for determining impairment losses not only incurred losses but also expected
      credit losses are recognized expected credit losses are required to be recognized either in the amount
      of the 12month expected credit losses  the present value of the expected credit losses resulting
      from the default events possible in the 12 months following the reporting date  or in the amount of
      the lifetime expected credit losses the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses is required if the
      credit risk of the financial instruments concerned has increased significantly since initial recognition

      transition requirements
      subject to endorsement by the eu ifrs 9 must be applied for fiscal years beginning on or after
      january 1 2018 earlier application is permitted

      ifrs 9 no longer requires restatement of priorperiod figures upon initial application of ifrs 9
      when an entity chooses to apply this exemption additional disclosures are required under ifrs 7 to
      allow for assessment of the effects of the firsttime application of ifrs 9

      gea group is currently assessing what impact the application of ifrs 9 will have on the groups net
      assets financial position and results of operations

                     notes to the consolidated financial statements  reporting principles




ifrs 14 regulatory deferral accounts  issued by the iasb in january 2014
there is currently no standard in ifrss that addresses the accounting for rateregulated sales activities
if rate regulation leads to a situation where expenditure in the current fiscal year has an effect on the
rates an entity may charge in future fiscal years this may result in economic benefits or disadvantages
for the entity in some countries national gaap permits or requires that such economic benefits are
capitalized or deferred

the new standard aims to improve the comparability between financial statements of entities that
engage in rateregulated sales activities ifrs 14 permits a firsttime adopter of ifrss to continue to
present rateregulated sales activities in accordance with its previous gaap accounting policies
applied on transition to ifrss however effects from the capitalization or deferral of economic
advantages must then be reported separately as the iasb is currently carrying out a project on
accounting for rateregulated activities ifrs 14 represents an interim solution subject to endorsement
by the eu ifrs 14 must be applied by firsttime adopters of ifrss from january 1 2016 earlier
application is permitted the new requirements do not affect the consolidated financial statements
since application of ifrs 14 is mandatory only for firsttime adopters of ifrss

ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers  issued by the iasb in may 2014
the new standard pools the existing revenue recognition requirements and establishes a single
revenue recognition model ifrs 15 applies to the recognition of contracts with customers for the
provision of services and the sale of goods and thus also covers the recognition of construction
contracts which were previously governed by ias 11

the new integrated revenue recognition model provides a fivestep framework for determining the
amount of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition

1 identification of the contract with the customer
2 identification of separate performance obligations
3 determination of the total transaction price
4 allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations
5 recognition of revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied

a performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied when control over the goods sold or services
provided is transferred to the customer the accounting treatment differs depending on whether
control passes at a point in time or over time if control is transferred to the customer over time
revenue is recognized based on the stage of completion provided this can be reasonably measured

gea group is currently assessing the impact of the new requirements at present gea group does
not believe that the new requirements will have a significant impact on the groups net assets
financial position and results of operations however the timing of revenue recognition may change
for certain orders




                                           gea annual report 2015                                            131

                           notes to the consolidated financial statements  reporting principles




      in addition ifrs 15 introduces extensive disclosures on revenue recognition

      in september 2015 the iasb issued an amendment to ifrs 15 deferring the timing of initial
      application subject to endorsement by the eu ifrs 15 must therefore be applied for fiscal years
      beginning on or after january 1 2018 earlier application of the requirements is permitted initial
      application is retrospective with certain practical expedients permitted under ifrs 15

      ifrs 16 leases  issued by the iasb in january 2016
      the new lease accounting standard has introduced a single lessee accounting model in which all
      leases and the associated contractual rights and obligations are recorded on the balance sheet this
      has eliminated the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases for a lessee as so
      far required under ias 17

      for every lease agreement a liability corresponding to future lease payments must be recognized by the
      lessee and a rightofuse asset capitalized at the present value of future lease payments plus directly
      attributable costs the lease payments include fixed payments variable payments as long as these are
      indexbased expected payments based on residual value guarantees and where applicable the exercise
      price of purchase options and penalties for the premature termination of lease agreements during the
      term of the lease agreement the lease liability is amortized using financial valuation methods in a similar
      way to that stipulated in the ias 17 regulations governing finance leases the rightofuse asset however
      is depreciated resulting in higher expenditure at the beginning of the term of a lease agreement
      compared with the previous regulations accounting for shortterm leases and leased assets of low value
      is simplified
      for lessors on the other hand the regulations of the new standard resemble those of the previous
      standard ias 17 leases continue to be classified either as finance or operating leases leases which
      essentially transfer all risks and rewards associated with ownership of the asset are classified as
      finance leases while all other leases are classified as operating leases the ias 17 criteria have been
      adopted by ifrs 16 for classification purposes

      in addition ifrs 16 contains a series of additional regulations regarding reporting and disclosures in
      the notes as well as sale and leaseback transactions

      the new release replaces the currently valid rules of ias 17 leases and the associated
      interpretations in ifric 4 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease sic 15 operating
      leases  incentives and sic 27 evaluating the substance of transactions involving the legal form
      of a lease

      gea group is currently analyzing the implications of the new regulations its current assumption being
      that the new provisions will result in an increase in total assets and liabilities as well as higher ebitda

      subject to endorsement by the eu these new regulations must be applied for fiscal years beginning
      on or after january 1 2019 earlier application is permitted as long as ifrs 15 is also applied

                    notes to the consolidated financial statements  reporting principles




amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28  sale or contribution of assets between an investor
and its associate or joint venture  issued by the iasb in september 2014
the amendments address a known inconsistency between the requirements of ifrs 10 and those of
ias 28 2011 in cases where assets are sold to or contributed by an associate or a joint venture in the
future the gain or loss resulting from such a transaction will only be recognized in full if the asset
sold or contributed is a business within the meaning of ifrs 3 regardless of whether the transaction
is structured as a share deal or an asset deal however if the assets do not constitute a business any
gain or loss is recognized only in proportion to the investors interest in the associate or joint
venture

gea group does not expect the implementation of the amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28 to
materially affect its financial reporting

in december 2015 the iasb issued an amendment to ifrs 15 deferring the timing of initial
application the reason for the postponement is that the iasb wants to take another look at certain
transactions in the context of a research project on the equity method of accounting
notwithstanding this deferral early application of the amendments will be permitted once they have
been endorsed by the eu which is still outstanding

amendments to ias 1 presentation of financial statements  disclosure initiative  issued
by the iasb in december 2014
the amendments are attributable to an iasb initiative to improve the presentation and disclosure
requirements in existing standards they clarify that disclosures are generally only required if their
content is not immaterial in addition they clarify how shares in the other comprehensive income of
equityaccounted companies should be presented in the statement of comprehensive income the
amendments also extend the requirements on the aggregation and disaggregation of line items in the
balance sheet and statement of comprehensive income lastly they ease the rigid requirements
regarding the structure of the notes so that these can now be structured in a way that takes better
account of their relevance for the individual company

gea group does not expect the implementation of the amendments to ias 1 to materially affect its
financial reporting

the amendments will be required to be applied for the first time in fiscal years beginning on or after
january 1 2016 earlier application is permitted

amendments to ias 7 statement of cash flows  issued by the iasb in january 2016
as part of its disclosure initiative the international accounting standards board iasb has
published its amendments to ias 7 statement of cash flows

these require a company to disclose changes to such financial liabilities the inflows and outflows of
which appear in the cash flow statement under cash flow from financing activities the associated
financial assets must also be included in the disclosures eg financial assets from hedging
transactions in particular casheffective changes changes resulting from the purchase or sale of
companies exchangerate related changes and changes in the fair value of assets must be reported
the proposed format for the corresponding disclosures is a reconciliation between the opening and
closing balances

                           notes to the consolidated financial statements  reporting principles




      gea group does not expect the implementation of the amendments to ias 7 to materially affect its
      financial reporting

      subject to their endorsement by the eu the amendments will be required to be applied for the first
      time in fiscal years beginning on or after january 1 2017 earlier application is permitted no comparative
      figures from the previous year have to be provided in the year when the regulations are first applied

      amendments to ias 12 income taxes  recognition of deferred tax assets
      for unrealized losses  issued by the iasb in january 2016
      the amendments made to ias 12 serve to clarify that writedowns to a lower market value of debt
      instruments measured at fair value resulting from a change in the market interest rate can give rise
      to deductible temporary differences this expressly also applies to cases where the loss is not realized
      and in future if held to maturity will be reversed as the debt instrument is amortized at the notional
      value it does not matter whether or not the owner expects to hold the debt instrument until maturity
      thereby realizing its full notional value

      in this context it is also clarified that all deductible temporary differences must be assessed as a
      whole to establish whether sufficient taxable income can be generated in future in order to be able to
      use and recognize them an independent assessment may only be made if and to the extent that the
      tax legislation distinguishes between different types of taxable profits in addition ias 12 has added
      new rules and examples regarding the assessment of future taxable income for the accounting of
      deferred tax assets

      gea group does not expect the implementation of the amendments to ias 12 to materially affect its
      financial reporting

      subject to their endorsement by the eu the amendments will be required to be applied retrospectively
      for fiscal years beginning on or after january 1 2017 earlier application is permitted when the
      amendments are initially applied the individual equity components affected by the change will not
      be required to be adjusted in the opening balance of the earliest period shown if this simplification
      is used all changes in equity can be recorded in the revenue reserves instead

      amendments to ias 19 employee benefits  defined benefit plans employee
      contributions  issued by the iasb in november 2013
      the amendments concern requirements relating to contributions from employees or third parties
      that are linked to service and clarify the corresponding requirements for attributing such contributions
      to periods of service in addition the accounting for contributions that are independent of the
      number of years of service has been simplified

      gea group does not expect the implementation of the amendments to ias 19 to materially affect its
      financial reporting

      the amendments will be required to be applied retrospectively for the first time in fiscal years
      beginning on or after february 1 2015 earlier application is permitted

      from the date on which control is lost

      acquired subsidiaries are accounted for using the purchase method the consideration paid is
      measured on the basis of the fair value of the assets received the liabilities assumed to the seller and
      the equity instruments issued at the transaction date the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
      and contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are recognized at their fair value at
      the transaction date irrespective of any noncontrolling interests any contingent consideration
      agreed is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date subsequent changes in fair value are
      recognized in profit or loss

      the excess of cost over the share of the fair value of the subsidiarys net assets acquired is recognized
      as goodwill if after a further examination cost is lower than the share of the fair value of the
      subsidiarys acquired net assets measured at fair value the difference is recognized as a gain in profit
      or loss

      intragroup receivables liabilities income and expenses are eliminated as are cash flows and profits
      and losses from intragroup transactions

      if consolidated subsidiaries have a different reporting date to the parent they are included on the
      basis of interim financial statements as of december 31 2015

                     notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




a total of 46 subsidiaries previous year 51 were not consolidated since their effect on the groups
net assets financial position and results of operations is not material even when viewed in the
aggregate their consolidated revenue amounts to 03 percent previous year 02 percent of the
groups aggregate consolidated revenue while their earnings account for 02 percent previous
year 11 percent of recognized earnings before tax of the complete group and their equity accounts
for 08 percent previous year 10 percent of consolidated equity the subsidiaries are measured at
cost and recognized as noncurrent other financial assets as their fair value cannot be determined
with sufficient certainty

a complete list of all subsidiaries associates and joint ventures can be found in section 124

changes in ownership interest
changes in gea groups ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in obtaining or losing
control are equity transactions the carrying amounts of controlling and noncontrolling interests
must be adjusted in such way that they reflect the changes in ownership interests in the subsidiaries
any difference between the amount by which the noncontrolling interests are adjusted and the fair
value of the consideration paid or received must be recognized directly in equity and attributed to
the owners of gea group

investments in associates and joint ventures
entities over which a group company can exercise significant influence ie it can participate in the
investees financial and operating policy decisions are accounted for as associates this generally relates
to companies in which gea group directly or indirectly holds 20 to 50 percent of the voting rights

joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the parties involved have joint control over the
arrangement and rights to its net assets joint control exists when decisions about the relevant
activities of the joint arrangement require the unanimous consent of gea group and the other
parties that collectively control the arrangement

associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method at the groups share of
adjusted equity they are initially recognized at cost any goodwill arising on acquisition is included
in the carrying amount of the investment

the groups share of the profit or loss of equityaccounted investments is recognized and presented
separately in the income statement the groups share of income and expenses recognized outside
profit or loss is reported directly in other comprehensive income if the groups share of an associates
or joint ventures loss exceeds the carrying amount of the net investment in the associate or joint
venture no further losses are recognized

where necessary the accounting policies of associates and joint ventures are adjusted to comply with
uniform group accounting principles
as of the reporting date two investments in associates previous year two and six investments in
joint ventures previous year six were accounted for using the equity method

                           notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




      joint operations
      joint operations are joint arrangements whereby the parties involved have joint control over the
      arrangement and rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement
      joint control exists when decisions about the relevant activities of the joint arrangement require the
      unanimous consent of gea group and the other parties that collectively control the arrangement

      the assets liabilities income and expenses of joint operations are accounted for in proportion to
      gea groups interest in them in accordance with the relevant ifrss

      currency translation
      the group companies prepare their annual financial statements on the basis of their respective
      functional currencies

      foreign currency transactions entered into by companies included in the consolidated financial
      statements are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the
      transaction date monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the applicable exchange rate at each
      reporting date the exchange rate gains and losses resulting from these items are generally reported
      in the income statement under other income or expenses

      all financial statements of companies whose functional currencies differ from the reporting currency are
      translated into the reporting currency used in gea groups consolidated financial statements the assets
      and liabilities of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are translated at the
      middle rates prevailing at the reporting date the income statements of these companies are translated at
      the average rates for the period under review if these average rates are not a reasonable approximation
      of the actual transaction rates the income statements are translated at the relevant transaction rates any
      translation differences are reported in equity under other comprehensive income and adjusted

      goodwill from the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries is translated at the closing rate as an asset
      attributable to these companies

      property plant and equipment
      items of property plant and equipment are carried at cost less cumulative depreciation and
      impairment losses plus reversals of impairment losses

      expenses for major regular maintenance are amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset
      concerned or over the period to the next maintenance date

      the carrying amount of items of property plant and equipment is reviewed if it is likely to have
      been impaired by events or changes in circumstances an impairment test is performed by
      comparing the assets carrying amount with its recoverable amount the recoverable amount is
      defined as the higher of internal value in use and fair value less costs to sell fair value is primarily
      determined on the basis of the current local market price for used machinery or commercial real
      estate if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognized




138                                              gea annual report 2015

                     notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




to assess impairment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which separate cash flows can be
identified if the reason for the impairment subsequently ceases to apply the impairment loss is
reversed up to a maximum of historical cost net of accumulated depreciation

leases
leases are agreements that grant the right to use an asset for a defined period in return for a payment
leases are accounted for as finance leases if substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to using the
leased asset and therefore beneficial ownership are attributable to the lessee as a result the gea group
companies that as lessees bear substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the leased asset
recognize the asset at the lower of fair value or the present value of minimum lease payments and
depreciate the asset in subsequent periods over the shorter of the lease term or the assets estimated
useful life a corresponding liability is recognized which is amortized in the following periods using the
effective interest method payments to the lessor are divided into an interest and a principal repayment
element with the interest element being recognized in profit or loss over the lease term as a continuous
interest payment on the residual lease liability all other leases under which gea group is a lessee are
treated as operating leases in these cases the lease payments are recognized as an expense using the
straightline method

lease transactions under which gea group companies are the lessor and substantially all the risks and
rewards associated with the leased asset are transferred to the lessee are accounted for as sales and
financing business a receivable is reported in the amount of the net investment under the lease the
interest income subsequently generated is recognized in profit or loss all other lease transactions under
which the group is the lessor are treated as operating leases in this case the asset leased for use remains
on the balance sheet and is depreciated the lease payments are recognized as income using the straight
line method over the term of the lease

various companies included in the consolidated financial statements have sold and leased back items
of property plant and equipment in the past depending on the allocation of risk these sale and
leaseback transactions resulted in a finance lease or an operating lease in the case of operating
leases the entire gain was recognized immediately if the asset was sold at fair value if the asset was
sold above its fair value the difference between the selling price and fair value was deferred and
recognized over the lease term

investment property
property that is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation is reported as investment property in the
case of property that is held partly to earn rentals and partly to produce or supply goods or services or
for administrative purposes the entire property is classified as investment property if the own use
proportion is insignificant this is assumed to be the case if the proportion is below 10 percent

                           notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




      cost is depreciated using the straightline method over a period of between 10 and 50 years the same
      measurement method is applied as for property plant and equipment

      goodwill
      goodwill arising from business combinations is recognized as an intangible asset

      goodwill is tested for impairment at segment level at least once a year at the end of the fiscal year
      and if any of the cashgenerating units with goodwill are showing signs of impairment operating
      segments in the form of the business areas were identified as cashgenerating units with goodwill
      for the purpose of impairment testing the recoverable amount of a business area is compared with
      its carrying amount including the goodwill the recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of
      internal value in use and fair value less costs to sell fair value less costs to sell is the measure for the
      impairment of business units classified as held for sale if the carrying amount of the business
      areas assets exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment loss in the amount of the difference is
      recognized in profit or loss

      an impairment loss initially reduces the carrying amount of goodwill any amount exceeding
      goodwill is allocated proportionately to the carrying amounts of noncurrent nonfinancial assets

      the value in use of the business units classified as continuing operations is calculated annually at the
      end of the fiscal year using the discounted cash flow method it is only necessary to estimate a selling
      price for the business units classified as continuing operations if the value in use is less than the
      carrying amount

      other intangible assets
      other intangible assets include both internally generated and purchased assets internally generated
      intangible assets comprise capitalized development costs in addition to contractbased rights
      purchased intangible assets mainly contain technologies brand names and customer relationships
      technologies brand names and customer relationships are usually acquired in connection with
      takeovers internally generated and purchased intangible assets are recognized at cost

      if the useful life of an intangible asset can be determined the asset is amortized on a straightline
      basis over its useful life intangible assets whose useful life cannot be determined are recognized at
      cost

      the carrying amount of an intangible asset is reviewed if it is likely to have been impaired by events
      or changes in circumstances intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment
      at least once a year this requires the recoverable amount of the assets to be determined the recoverable
      amount corresponds to the higher of internal value in use and fair value less costs to sell if the
      carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount the asset is written down to the recoverable
      amount previously recognized impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the impairment no
      longer apply impairment losses are reversed up to a maximum of the amortized historical cost

                    notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




indefinitelived intangible assets are also examined each year to determine whether the classification
of the asset as indefinitelived can be retained any change to a finite useful life is applied
prospectively

other financial assets
other financial assets include investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other equity investments
other securities financial receivables except trade receivables and derivative financial instruments

shares in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other equity investments are allocated to the available
forsale financial assets measurement category they are measured at cost because the shares in
these corporations are not traded in an active market and their fair value cannot be reliably
measured this is due to the significant margin of fluctuation for fair value measurement the
probabilities of the various estimates cannot be reliably determined within the margin of fluctuation
a reliable fair value can only be determined during sale negotiations the group does not intend to
sell these financial assets

securitized debt instruments that are intended to be held to maturity are allocated to the heldto
maturity investments measurement category and measured accordingly at amortized cost using the
effective interest method all other securities are measured at fair value and any fluctuations in value
are recognized directly in other comprehensive income

financial receivables are allocated to the loans and receivables measurement category and
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method

derivative financial instruments are used exclusively for hedging purposes in particular to hedge
currency risk and to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations resulting from financing
transactions they are always carried at fair value if derivative financial instruments are not
included in a documented hedging relationship they are allocated to the financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss measurement category and their fair value changes are recognized in the
income statement if the derivative financial instruments included in a recognized hedging
relationship are used to hedge future cash flows the fair value fluctuations are recognized in other
comprehensive income

embedded financial derivatives are separated from their host contracts if certain qualifying criteria
relating to their recognition and measurement are met

financial assets are recognized as soon as gea group has received a cash payment or it has the right
to receive cash flows in the case of regular way purchases of nonderivative financial assets the
settlement date ie the delivery date of the financial assets is decisive assets are derecognized as
soon as the right to receive cash payments or other financial assets expires as a result of payment
waiver statutory limitation offsetting or any other factor or the right is transferred to another
person with the risks passing in full to the purchaser in the case of regular way sales of non
derivative financial assets the settlement date is taken to be the date of derecognition in line with
the principle used for recognition

items are originally recognized at fair value or in the case of financial assets not measured at fair
value including directly attributable transaction costs

financial assets or groups of financial assets are tested for indications of impairment at each reporting
date impairment losses are recognized in the income statement financial assets are impaired if




                                          gea annual report 2015                                            141

                          notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




      following one or more events that occurred after initial recognition of the asset there is objective
      evidence that the expected future cash flows have declined objective evidence of impairment may be
      for example significant financial difficulties of the debtor or payment default in the case of financial
      assets measured at amortized cost eg unquoted equity instruments the impairment loss corresponds
      to the difference between the carrying amount of the financial instrument and the present value of the
      future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate

      if the reasons for impairment no longer apply impairment losses on financial assets  with the
      exception of equity instruments  are reversed to income up to the amount of the amortized cost that
      would have applied if no impairment loss had been charged

      recognized hedging relationships hedge accounting
      at the time they are entered into derivative financial instruments that are included in a recognized
      hedging relationship are designated either as a hedge against changes in the fair value of assets
      liabilities or firm commitments fair value hedge or as a hedge of future cash flows in connection
      with assets and liabilities cash flow hedge

      in the case of an effective hedge of the risk of a change in fair value the change in the fair value of
      both the derivative and the hedged item is recognized in the income statement changes in fair value
      offset each other in a perfect hedge gea group does not currently apply hedge accounting for fair
      value hedges

      if derivatives are used to hedge future cash flows the effective portion of the change in the
      derivatives fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income the ineffective portion of the
      change in fair value is reported as a gain or loss the item recognized in other comprehensive income
      arising from the effective portion of the change in fair value is recognized in the income statement as
      soon as the hedged item is settled if settlement of the hedged item leads to the recognition of a
      nonfinancial asset the changes in value previously recognized in other comprehensive income are
      offset against the cost of the nonfinancial asset if contrary to previous assumptions the hedged
      transaction is not executed the changes in value previously recognized in equity are reversed directly
      to profit or loss

      the group predominantly uses cash flow hedges to hedge interest rate risk especially with regard to
      currency translation risk gea group also enters into hedging transactions in accordance with its risk
      management principles that offer economic hedges of existing risks but do not meet the strict hedge
      accounting requirements of ias 39 currency forwards that are used to hedge currency risk arising
      from monetary assets and liabilities are not aggregated into a recognized hedging relationship
      effects arising from the translation of balance sheet items that are recognized in the income
      statement are largely offset by changes in the fair values of currency forwards that are also
      recognized in the income statement

deferred taxes
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences between the carrying
amounts in the respective national tax accounts and those in the ifrs financial statements that are
included in the consolidated financial statements deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax loss
carryforwards deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss
carryforwards are recognized only to the extent that there is likely to be sufficient taxable income
available in future

deferred tax liabilities are not recognized on taxable temporary differences arising from investments
in subsidiaries associates or joint ventures as long as the reversal of temporary differences is
unlikely in the foreseeable future

inventories
inventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value acquisition cost is calculated
at average cost or using the firstin firstout fifo method production cost includes direct costs plus
materials and production overheads depreciation and productionrelated administrative costs net
realizable value is calculated as the estimated sale proceeds less costs incurred until completion and
selling expenses previously recognized impairment losses must be reversed if the reasons for the
impairment no longer apply impairment losses are reversed up to a maximum of the amortized
historical cost

trade receivables
trade receivables include no interest component and are recognized in the balance sheet at their
principal amount less appropriate allowances for bad debts

trade receivables that are sold to financial services companies under factoring agreements are
derecognized once substantially all the risks and rewards have been transferred to the financial
services company

construction contracts
receivables and revenues from construction contracts are recognized using the percentage of
completion poc method

the percentage of completion is determined using the costtocost method which is derived from the
ratio of contract costs incurred to the total estimated contract costs contracts are measured at
production cost plus a profit in proportion to the stage of completion losses on construction
contracts are immediately recognized in full in the fiscal year in which they are identified regardless
of the stage of completion if the contract costs incurred and the gains or losses recognized exceed
the progress billings the excess amount is capitalized and reported under trade receivables if the
progress payments received exceed the capitalized costs and recognized gains or losses at the
reporting date they are reported as a liability under other liabilities advance payments received on
construction contracts are reported as a liability under the same item

if the contract margin cannot be estimated reliably revenue is recognized only in the amount of the
contract costs incurred zeroprofit method a profit is only recognized once the contract margin can
be estimated reliably




                                          gea annual report 2015                                             143

                           notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




      payments for differences in the overall contract claims and premiums are included in the contract
      revenue insofar as these will probably result in revenue that is capable of being estimated reliably

      cash and cash equivalents
      cash and cash equivalents comprise cash demand deposits and financial assets that can be converted
      into cash at any time and that are subject to only slight fluctuations in value they are recognized at
      fair value

      assets held for sale liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations
      noncurrent assets or groups of assets classified as held for sale within the meaning of ifrs 5 are
      recognized at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell classification as held for
      sale is made when the carrying amount of a noncurrent asset or disposal group will be recovered
      principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and the criteria defined in
      ifrs 5 have been met overall the corresponding assets as well as the liabilities of a disposal group
      are reported separately in the balance sheet as assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale on
      initial classification as held for sale noncurrent assets or assets and liabilities of disposal groups are
      first measured in accordance with the applicable ifrss they are measured at the lower of their
      carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with disposal groups being measured as a whole as
      the carrying amount of heldforsale depreciable assets is principally realized by the disposal rather
      than the use of these assets they are no longer depreciated once they have been reclassified

      if a disposal group represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation it
      qualifies as a discontinued operation the results of discontinued operations are reported separately
      in the income statement as profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations in addition the
      prioryear comparatives are adjusted in the income statement so that the results of these operations
      are also reported under discontinued operations cash flows from discontinued operations are
      reported separately in the cash flow statement in this case as well the prioryear comparatives are
      adjusted accordingly revenue and expenditures from intragroup transactions are taken into account
      when presenting results from discontinued operations if they will continue to arise after the disposal
      of a discontinued operation

      as a general principle the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements relate to
      the assets or liabilities recognized in the corresponding line items and to continuing operations
      where disclosures relate to gea group including assets held for sale as well as the associated
      liabilities and discontinued operations this is indicated either by a statement that the disclosures
      refer to the complete group or by another comment

subscribed capital
ordinary shares are classified as equity treasury shares are deducted from the equity attributable to
the shareholders of gea group aktiengesellschaft

obligations under pension plans
obligations under pension plans relate to postemployment benefit obligations defined benefit
obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method the present value of these
obligations reflects expected future salary and pension trends since the entitlements earnable in the
period up to the retirement age depend on these claims under supplementary healthcare benefit
insurance are included in the actuarial measurement of assumptions made in respect of healthcare
cost trends the pension obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial reports by independent
actuaries

in order to provide these pension benefits the company in some cases holds financial assets in long
term funds outside gea group and qualifying insurance policies insofar as the entitlements are
funded by such external assets plan assets their fair value is offset against the present value of the
defined benefit obligation the resulting balance is reported under noncurrent employee benefit
obligations or other noncurrent financial assets net carrying amount

actuarial gains and losses from the remeasurement of the net carrying amount are recognized in
other comprehensive income in the year in which they arise and reported in retained earnings after
adjustment for tax effects this also applies to the recognition of the difference between the actual
returns on plan assets and the returns calculated using the discount factor costs from unwinding the
discount on the net carrying amount are recognized in interest expenses income is recognized in
interest income current and past service cost for the period as well as gains and losses from
settlements are recognized in the relevant function costs

other employee benefit obligations
other employee benefit obligations comprise other longterm benefits and all shortterm benefits
shortterm employee benefit obligations are expected to be settled in full no more than 12 months
after completion of the service rendered they include wages salaries social insurance contributions
paid vacation and profitsharing arrangements they are recognized as an expense at the same time
as the work is remunerated any expenditure in excess of the payments already made is reported as a
deferred liability at the reporting date other longterm employee benefits such as jubilee payments
or partial retirement arrangements are recognized at the actuarial present value of the obligation at
the reporting date securities are pledged to the beneficiaries to protect vested partial retirement
credits against the employers insolvency the fair value of these securities is offset against the
corresponding liability

also reported under other employee benefit obligations are liabilities in respect of severance
payments and redundancy plans resulting from among other things obligations in connection with
restructuring provisions

      provisions
      provisions for uncertain liabilities are recognized where there is a legal or constructive obligation to
      a third party a future outflow of resources is likely and the expected settlement value can be
      estimated reliably the present value of the settlement amount is recognized if the time value of
      money is material amounts are discounted at the market rates for the appropriate maturity and
      currency discount unwinding costs are reported in interest expense

      the cost at the time when reserve is recognized is reported in cost of sales when warranty of
      provisions are recognized in all other cases provisions are recognized when the product is accepted
      the provision is measured on the basis of both the warranty cost actually incurred in the past and on
      the evaluated overall risk inherent in the system or product provisions are also recognized if a claim
      is made under a warranty and a loss is likely recourse claims against suppliers are capitalized if their
      services are subject to a warranty and it is highly likely that the claim can be enforced

      provisions for expected losses from onerous contracts are recognized if the unavoidable costs of
      meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received
      under it the unavoidable costs also include the unavoidable overheads needed to meet the
      obligations

      financial liabilities
      financial liabilities comprise bonds bank loans and liabilities under finance leases initial
      recognition is at fair value less transaction costs incurred they are subsequently measured at
      amortized cost using the effective interest method liabilities under finance leases are initially
      measured at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of minimum lease
      payments

      other liabilities
      the recognition and subsequent measurement of other liabilities is the same as for financial
      liabilities with the exception of advance payments and the gross amount due to customers for
      contract work advance payments are stated at their principal amount please see the information
      provided on the recognition of construction contracts for the measurement of the gross amount due
      to customers for contract work

                    notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




trade payables
trade payables also include liabilities for goods received or services rendered that have not yet been
invoiced as there is only slight uncertainty as to the amount of the liability trade payables are
recognized at fair value this corresponds to the settlement amount in the case of liabilities due
within one year

revenue recognition
trade receivables that are sold to financial services companies under factoring agreements are
derecognized once substantially all the risks and rewards have been transferred to the financial
services company this normally occurs when the goods are handed over to the customer revenue
from services is recognized when the service is rendered revenue is measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or to be received customer bonuses discounts or rebates reduce the amount
of revenue recognized

revenue from construction contracts is generally recognized using the percentageofcompletion
method under which revenue is recognized in accordance with the stage of completion the
percentage of completion is determined using the costtocost method which is derived from the
ratio of contract costs incurred to the total estimated contract costs contract costs include direct
costs plus materials and construction overheads depreciation productionrelated administrative
costs and such other costs that are specifically chargeable to the customer under the terms of the
contract where a construction contract is performed over a long period and where the contract is
largely financed by gea group contract costs also include directly attributable borrowing costs
conversely income from the investment of advance payments received is offset against contract costs
where this has a material influence on the contract margin adjustments are made for variations in
contract work claims and incentive payments insofar as these will probably result in revenue that is
capable of being reliably estimated

in line with the percentage of completion method construction contracts are measured as the
contract costs incurred as of the reporting date plus the profit attributable to the proportion of work
completed revenue recognized is reported under trade payables less progress billings if the
outcome of a construction contract cannot be reliably estimated the probable recoverable revenue is
recognized up to the amount of the costs incurred contract costs are recognized as an expense in the
period in which they are incurred if it is foreseeable that the total contract costs will exceed the
contract revenue the expected loss is recognized immediately as an expense

interest income is recognized ratably over the remaining maturity based on the effective interest rate
and the amount of the remaining receivable dividend income on equity instruments is recognized if
the right to receive payment is based on legally assertable claims

revenue from royalties is recognized in the period in which it arises in accordance with the
underlying contracts

      sharebased payment
      gea group has a sharebased payment program under which selected managers are granted
      performance shares the fair value of these rights is calculated at the grant date and allocated as an
      expense over the vesting period using the straightline method a corresponding provision is
      recognized the provision is remeasured at each reporting date and at the payment date furthermore
      in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 part of the bonuses earned by executive board members was converted
      into phantom shares the entitlement from phantom shares is measured at the current share price at
      the reporting date in fiscal year 2012 a longterm share price component was introduced as part of the
      revision of the variable remuneration system for executive board members payment from this
      remuneration component is dependent on the performance of gea shares compared with a bench
      mark index the entitlement from the longterm share price component is measured at fair value at
      the reporting date changes in the fair value of the provision for sharebased payment programs are
      recognized as interest expense or income see section 734

      in addition one group company grants its employees options on shares of the company via a trustee
      the cost of this sharebased payment is estimated at the grant date and amortized using the straight
      line method up to the exercise date see section 71

      research and development
      research expenditures are recognized immediately as an expense development costs that are
      designed to significantly enhance a product or process are capitalized if completion of the product or
      process is technically and economically feasible the development is marketable the expenditures can
      be measured reliably and adequate resources are available to complete the development project all
      other development expenditures are recognized immediately as expenses capitalized development
      expenditures for completed projects are reported at cost less cumulative amortization and impairment
      losses capitalized development costs for intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for
      impairment once a year

      development costs that are required under construction contracts are capitalized as part of the cost
      of the asset

      government grants
      government grants are recognized at fair value provided that the group meets the conditions
      necessary to receive the grant government grants to cover expenses are recognized over the period
      in which the costs for which the grants were awarded are incurred government grants for capital
      expenditure are deducted from the cost of purchasing the corresponding asset

22      estimates and management judgment
preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and exercise
judgment that may affect the companys assets liabilities provisions and deferred tax assets and
liabilities as well as its income and expenses and contingent liabilities

factors that may cause amounts to fall below estimates might include a deterioration in the global
economy movements in exchange rates and interest rates as well as material litigation and changes
in environmental or other legislation production errors the loss of key customers and rising
borrowing costs may also adversely affect the groups future performance

the recognition and measurement of the following assets and liabilities are in some cases based on
management judgment all assumptions represent the best of managements knowledge and belief in
order to convey a true and fair view of the companys net assets financial position and results of
operations if actual circumstances subsequently differ from those forecast this will affect the
recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities depending on the item concerned earnings
may also be affected

basis of consolidation
management judgment was applied in defining the basis of consolidation see section 21
particularly with regard to assessing which subsidiaries to exclude from the consolidated financial
statements on the basis of materiality

acquisitions
goodwill is reported in the balance sheet as a result of acquisitions when an acquired company is
initially consolidated all its identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognized at
their acquisitiondate fair value a basic problem is estimating these fair values as a rule land and
buildings are measured on the basis of independent appraisals if intangible assets are identified
their fair values are calculated using an appropriate measurement method these measurements are
made on the basis of assumptions by management with respect to the future value of the relevant
assets and the discount rate obligations for contingent consideration are recognized on the basis of
the current planning

goodwill
the group tests goodwill for impairment annually the recoverable amounts calculated for this
purpose for segments classified as continuing operations are determined based on value in use value
in use is calculated using assumptions by management this also applies to the calculation performed
in the fiscal year of the reallocation of goodwill attributable to the former gea refrigeration
technologies segment to the two business areas solutions and equipment on the basis of the
relative values see section 63




                                            gea annual report 2015                                               149

                           notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




      taxes
      gea group operates in a large number of countries and is therefore subject to different tax jurisdictions
      calculating tax liabilities requires management to make various estimates management believes that it
      has made a reasonable estimate of tax uncertainties however no assurance can be given that the actual
      outcome of these uncertainties will correspond to the estimates made any deviations may have an
      impact on the level of tax liabilities or deferred taxes in the year of the decision

      when assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets management judges the extent to which
      realization of the deferred tax assets is sufficiently likely the question of whether the deferred tax
      assets can actually be realized depends on whether sufficient future taxable income can be generated
      against which the temporary differences or tax loss carryforwards can be offset management
      therefore analyzes the times at which the deferred tax liabilities reverse and expected future taxable
      income management forecasts whether deferred tax assets can be realized on the basis of expected
      future taxable income deferred tax assets decline if the estimate of planned taxable income
      decreases if tax benefits available as a result of tax strategies are reduced or the amount or timing of
      future tax benefits is restricted by changes in the law see section 88

      restructuring provisions
      restructuring provisions are recognized as soon as there is a constructive obligation to carry out
      restructuring measures from having informed the parties affected about the restructuring plan in
      assessing whether the criteria for recognition have been met the management must make certain
      assumptions as to whether the announcement has given rise to justified expectations among the
      parties affected that the company will carry out the restructuring and whether major changes to the
      restructuring plan are anticipated

      in order to determine the amount of the restructuring provisions management must above all
      estimate the amount of the expected severance payments to this end the management needs to
      make assumptions with regard to the wage structure and length of service of the employees affected
      by the cuts as well as to the manner in which the downsizing program is to be implemented eg
      voluntary schemes partial retirement redundancy packages

      measurement of assets held for sale liabilities associated with assets held for sale and
      classification of operations as discontinued
      assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount
      and fair value less costs to sell assumptions by management are taken into account when
      determining fair value less costs to sell the classification as held for sale or the classification of
      activities as attributable to discontinued operations also require estimates by management these
      estimates relate in particular to the question of whether the carrying amount of a noncurrent asset
      or a disposal group will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
      continuing use and whether the criteria set out under ifrs 5 have been met overall

                     notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




provisions and contingent liabilities
changes in estimates of the probability of a present obligation or of an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits could mean that items previously classified as contingent liabilities
must be reported as provisions or that the amount of provisions must be adjusted see section 62
this also applies in particular to environmental obligations

obligations under pension plans
the present value of pension obligations depends on actuarial assumptions these assumptions
comprise discount rates expected wage and salary increases as well as the pension increase rate and
mortality rates these assumptions could differ significantly from actual future outcomes as a result
of changes in market and economic conditions and could therefore have a material effect on the level
of the obligation and the related expenses

the discount rate used to measure the net carrying amount is calculated at the end of each year this
is the rate used to calculate the present value of future cash outflows expected to be required to settle
the obligation in order to calculate the discount rate the group uses the interest rate on highquality
corporate bonds denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are paid and whose terms
to maturity correspond to those of the pension obligations

other significant assumptions relating to pension obligations are partly based on market conditions
see section 631
construction contracts
the recognition of construction contracts using the percentage of completion method is based on
managements estimates of the cost of such contracts changes in estimates or differences between
the estimated cost and the actual cost have a direct effect on recognized earnings from construction
contracts the operating units continuously review the estimates and adjust them if required

litigation
in some cases gea group companies are parties to litigation the outcome of this litigation could have a
material effect on the groups net assets financial position and results of operations management
regularly analyzes current information on these legal disputes and recognizes provisions for probable
obligations including estimated legal costs both internal counsel and external lawyers are used to make
this assessment when deciding on the need to recognize provisions management takes into account the
probability of an unfavorable outcome and its ability to estimate the amount of the obligation with
sufficient reliability the filing of a suit or the formal assertion of a claim against a gea group company
does not necessarily mean that a provision must be recognized for the related risk see section 84

      3       financial risk management
      the executive board has put in place an effective set of guidelines to manage and hence largely limit
      or hedge financial risks throughout the group the objectives with regard to protecting assets
      eliminating gaps in security and improving efficiency in identifying and analyzing risks are clearly
      defined as are the relevant organizational structures powers and responsibilities the guidelines are
      based on the principles of system security the separation of functions transparency and immediate
      documentation for further information please see the discussion of the risk management system in
      the management report

      because it operates worldwide gea group is exposed to currency interest rate commodity price
      credit and liquidity risk in the course of its ordinary activities financial risk management aims to
      reduce this risk through the appropriate use of derivative and nonderivative hedging instruments

      currency risk
      because gea operates internationally its cash flows are denominated not only in euros but also in a
      number of other currencies particularly us dollars hedging the resulting currency risk is a key
      element of risk management

      the group guideline requires all group companies to hedge foreign currency items as they arise in
      order to fix prices on the basis of hedging rates currency risks are hedged for recognized hedged
      items unrecognized firm commitments and highly probable transactions the hedging periods are
      determined by the maturity of the hedged items and are usually up to 12 months but in exceptional
      cases may exceed that period significantly despite the hedging requirement changes in exchange
      rates may affect sales opportunities outside the eurozone
      group companies based in the eurozone are obliged to tender to geas central treasury and
      corporate finance unit all outstanding exposures relating to transactions in goods and services in
      major transaction currencies most of these exposures are passed on directly to banks at matching
      maturities depending on the hedging objective of the derivatives and the related accounting
      treatment they may also be hedged as part of a portfolio the hedging of financial transactions and
      transactions conducted by subsidiaries outside the eurozone is also closely coordinated with the
      central treasury and corporate finance unit

      interest rate risk
      because gea group operates worldwide liquidity is raised and invested in the international money
      and capital markets in different currencies but mainly in euros and at different maturities the
      resulting financial liabilities and investments are exposed to interest rate risk which must be
      assessed and managed by central financial management derivative financial instruments may be
      used on a casebycase basis to hedge interest rate risk and reduce the interest rate volatility and
      financing costs of the hedged items only the central treasury and corporate finance unit is
      permitted to enter into such interest rate hedges

                  notes to the consolidated financial statements  financial risk management




all interest rate derivatives are allocated to individual loans the hedging relationships are documented
and recognized as cash flow hedges overall the interest expense from the loans and the allocated
derivatives reported in the income statement reflects the fixed interest rate for the hedging relationship

crosscurrency swaps were used in connection with the financing of acquisitions in canada and the
uk they are recognized at fair value however they are not included in any documented hedging
relationship with intragroup hedged items the earnings effects arising from changes to currency
parities that have occurred since the beginning of the crosscurrency swaps and the earnings effects
due to the related intragroup receivables do not match due to different calculation bases forward
rate relative to spot rate the difference in value amounted to eur 6449 thousand in fiscal year
2015 previous year eur 270 thousand

commodity price risk
gea group requires various metals such as aluminum copper and steel whose purchase prices can
be subject to substantial fluctuations depending on the market situation longterm supply
agreements have been entered into with various suppliers in order to hedge commodity price risk

credit risk
financial instruments are exposed to credit risk in that the other party to the contract may fail to
fulfill its obligations the counterparty limit system used by gea group for financial management
aims to continuously assess and manage counterparty default risk a maximum risk limit has been
defined for each counterparty which in most cases is derived from the ratings from recognized credit
rating agencies and credit default swaps cdss appropriate action is taken if the individual limit is
exceeded

the financial standing of potential customers is ascertained via an internal risk board procedure
before orders are accepted active receivables management including nonrecourse factoring and
credit insurance is also performed in the case of export transactions confirmed and unconfirmed
letters of credit are used alongside sureties guarantees and cover notes including from export credit
agencies such as euler hermes in addition to local monitoring by the subsidiary in question gea
group oversees the main credit risks at group management level so that any accumulation of risk can
be better managed

since trade receivables are usually due from a large number of customers in different sectors and
regions there is no concentration of risk valuation allowances take account of specific credit risks

so as to reduce the credit risk involved derivative financial instruments are only entered into with
reputable financial institutions

the maximum exposure for the financial assets is limited to their carrying amount

liquidity risk
gea group is exposed to liquidity risk in that it may be unable to meet payment obligations because
it has insufficient cash funds at its disposal gea group is responsible for managing this risk cash
funds are arranged and credit lines managed on the basis of a multiyear financial plan and a rolling
monthbymonth cash forecast the funds are then made available to the companies by group
management cash flow from operating activities is the most important source of liquidity cash
pools have been established in 13 countries in order to optimize borrowing and the use of cash funds

      within gea group to achieve this the cash pools automatically balance the accounts of the
      participating group companies every day by crediting or debiting a target account at gea group
      aktiengesellschaft this prevents separate cash investments and borrowings by these companies to a
      large extent any additional liquidity requirements are generally borrowed by the gea group
      aktiengesellschaft which also invests surplus liquidity

      foreign currency sensitivity analysis
      gea group companies are always exposed to foreign currency risk if their cash flows are denominated in
      a currency other than their own functional currency as a general principle foreign currency risks
      must be hedged using appropriate financial instruments so that fluctuations arising from the hedged
      item underlying and the hedging transaction are neutralized over their duration

      the foreign currency risk presented in the sensitivity analysis results from the following
      transactions

       from currency derivatives used to hedge previously unrecognized hedged items ie for
        contractually agreed or expected transactions
        if the hedge has been effected for economic reasons and is not included in a documented hedging
        relationship a corresponding currency risk exposure will have a direct effect on earnings where
        interest rate derivatives are included in a hedging relationship in the form of cash flow hedges
        they are subject to equityrelated interest rate risk no interest rate derivatives were designated as
        cash flow hedges as of december 31 2015

       from crosscurrency swaps
        although swaps are matched by intragroup receivables as hedged items they are not included in a
        documented hedging relationship while receivables are measured using the spot rate the
        currency components of the swaps are measured on the basis of the forward rates the two rates
        could differ significantly depending on the interest rate difference between the two currencies

       from unhedged foreign currency transactions
        the translation of foreign currency receivables or liabilities at the closing rate has a direct effect
        on earnings

      the currency pairs in which the major part of the foreign currency cash flows is settled are included
      as relevant risk variables in the foreign currency sensitivity analysis the following table shows the
      sensitivity of a 10 percent increase or decrease in the euro from the perspective of the group

the nominal amount relates to all contractually agreed foreign currency cash flows as of the
reporting date which are translated into euros at the closing rate

the potential fluctuations in the profit or loss for the year result primarily from derivatives that are
not included in a designated hedging relationship but are used to avoid currency risk as part of the
general hedging strategy

interest rate sensitivity analysis
the interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the effects of changes in market interest rates on
interest income and expenses and equity the sensitivity analyses are based on the following
assumptions

 nonderivative fixedrate financial instruments are only subject to onbalancesheet interest rate
  risk if they are measured at fair value gea group measures such financial instruments at
  amortized cost

 nonderivative variablerate financial instruments whose interest payments are not included as
  hedged items in a hedging relationship that is recognized as a cash flow hedge are subject to
  interest rate risk in the income statement

 interest rate derivatives included in a hedging relationship that is recognized as a cash flow hedge
  are subject to equityrelated interest rate risk in the amount of the effective portion of the hedging
  relationship

 interest rate derivatives not included in a hedging relationship that is recognized as a cash flow
  hedge are subject to interest rate risk in the income statement

 currency derivatives are not subject to material interest rate risk and therefore have no effect on
  interest rate sensitivity

the sensitivity analysis assumes a linear shift in the yield curves for all currencies of 100 or 10
basis points as of the reporting date relatively speaking there is less of a downward shift in the
yield curve shift assumed for the sensitivity analysis than an upward shift the low near 0 percent
interest rate level avoids a shift to a significant negative interest rate this results in the following
effects for the simulated scenarios

                                                                                 12312015                                    12312014

following intensive preparations geas new group structure  which was developed as part of its
fit for 2020 initiative  was implemented on june 8 2015 as part of this new structure the
development and manufacturing of products and the provision of process solutions have been
bundled in two new business areas  equipment and solutions

the groups operating segments were reorganized accordingly during the reporting period thus the
former gea mechanical equipment and gea farm technologies segments were allocated to the
business area equipment while gea process engineering now belongs to the business area solutions
the former gea refrigeration technologies segment was split between the business areas equipment
and solutions with the goodwill attributable to the former segment being reallocated based on the
relative values as of the reorganization date

impairment test
goodwill recoverability was tested when the operating segments were restructured and at the end of
fiscal year 2015 the operating segments in the form of business areas were identified as cash
generating units with goodwill for the purpose of the yearend impairment test the recoverable
amounts for the business areas were compared with their carrying amounts which included any
goodwill allocated to them

the recoverable amount of an operating segment is determined by calculating value in use using the
discounted cash flow method the cash flows used are the aftertax operating cash flows from the
consolidated mediumterm planning threeyear period prepared by the executive board the values for
2016 were planned bottom up whereas the planning for 2017 and 2018 was conducted on a top down
basis the supervisory board has taken note of the corresponding plans assumptions for the period
beyond the planning horizon are based on the cash flows in the previous planning year extrapolated
using a uniform growth rate of 15 percent previous year 15 percent the underlying growth rates do
not exceed the average longterm growth rates for the markets in which the segments operate

      profit from these underlying trends growth is also assumed for the other customer industries by
      contrast declining growth rates have been factored in for the oil and gas industry these trends will
      also affect both business areas in addition planned growth for the individual business areas also
      takes account of actual past growth rates

      any other expenses and the savings from the fit for 2020 program were included in the planning as
      the criteria for recognition of a restructuring provision had been met by the reporting date

      with regard to raw material prices it is assumed that any increase can be offset by increased selling
      prices future acquisitions are not included in the planning process

      the total cost of capital assumed for discounting is based on a riskfree interest rate of 150 percent
      previous year 175 percent and a market risk premium of 675 percent previous year 675 percent in
      addition beta factors derived from the respective peer group a borrowing risk premium as well as
      capital structure were taken into account for each segment segmentspecific tax rates were also applied

      cash flows for the individual segments are discounted using the following aftertax rates

      connection with certain performance criteria relating to products or equipment eg guaranteed output
      volume quality of product manufactured warranties usually have a contractual term of between one
      and two years from the date on which the products or equipment are accepted in addition to warranties
      explicitly agreed under contract product liability rules apply in many sales countries and may also
      stipulate that the manufacturer is liable beyond the contractually defined term of the warranty in some
      cases recourse claims exist in the form of insurance refunds or subcontractor guarantees the level of
      provisions is based on managements best estimate as of december 31 2015 refund claims amounting to
      eur 385 thousand previous year eur 413 thousand against nongroup third parties were recognized
      gea group expects to settle most of the provisions for guarantees and warranties in the coming year

      provisions for financial guarantee contracts
      provisions for financial guarantee contracts comprise obligations under indemnification agreements
      as well as warranties and undertakings relating to the sale of business activities the changes in these
      provisions in fiscal year 2015 are primarily due to the resolution of uncertainties relating to risks
      from the sale of the plant engineering activities an outflow of approximately 10 percent of the
      provisions for financial guarantee contracts is expected in fiscal year 2016

      the rise in employee benefit obligations is largely due to restructuring measures in the context of the
      fit for 2020 initiative see section 84 as of december 31 2015 the corresponding obligations with
      regard to severance payments and redundancy packages amounted to eur 85347 thousand previous
      year eur 0 thousand eur 83337 thousand of which will be reported in current employee benefit

               supplementary healthcare benefits
      wherever possible defined benefit pension obligations and obligations under supplementary
      healthcare benefits are disclosed below in the aggregate and explained together

      furthermore the amounts presented include assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in the
      previous year where a reconciliation to line items in the financial statements is required this is

      defined benefit pension plans
      gea group employees are offered various benefit options mainly in the form of defined benefit and
      defined contribution pension plans

      defined benefit pension plan obligations exist in germany and outside of germany mainly in the
      usa switzerland and the united kingdom in addition other foreign companies have typical
      countryspecific pension plans that are funded in part by plan assets benefits and investments
      correspond to the countryspecific economic environment and requirements

      gea group views granting pension benefits as an opportunity to foster employee loyalty and
      engagement it is therefore a standard feature of the remuneration concept and has an employee
      contribution component where this is appropriate in connection with this gea group monitors
      developments on the human resources market and regularly checks that the benefits it grants are
      appropriate and in line with the market

      gea group does not believe that the pension obligations pose any risks over and above the
      customary extent and the general risks described

      pension benefits in germany
      in germany gea group grants oldage disability and survivors benefits to many of its employees
      new employees are generally only granted benefits that are partly funded by employee contributions

      as part of the general benefits provided all employees have the opportunity to voluntarily defer part
      of their compensation under this arrangement an agreed amount of their salary plus an employer
      contribution of up to 100 percent of the deferred amount is converted into a pension benefit a
      corresponding collective bargaining agreement was entered into in 2002 and revised in 2008

  notes to the consolidated financial statements  consolidated balance sheet disclosures equity and liabilities




up to now managers have received benefits comprising an incomerelated employerfunded basic
amount an employerfunded topup and a matching amount funded through deferred compensation
with an employer contribution of up to onethird of the deferred amount the additional contributions
from the topup and matching amounts are determined annually and converted into a pension benefit by
the employer these commitments are granted in the form of identical individual commitments

for both commitments the postretirement benefits are adjusted by 1 percent each year

for the most part geas executive pension scheme was converted to an assetbacked commitment in
the form of a defined benefit pension plan with effect from january 1 2015 the plan assets are
managed under a contractual trust arrangement cta and invested in mixed funds the size of the
employers contributions to the plan assets depends on the size of the fixed salaries of the
beneficiaries beneficiaries can also contribute from their own income by means of deferred
compensation the beneficiaries are then entitled to the net earnings generated by the plan assets
there is also a notional premium guarantee

entitlements from the earlier executive pension scheme remain valid and fewer beneficiaries will
remain in that scheme

in addition to the currently open benefit plans there are a number of historical pension plans in the
company these plans are generally closed to new employees but are maintained unchanged for
employees who were members at the time the plan was closed these include obligations under
bochumer verband and essener verband as well as obligations established independently by their
predecessors

the pension obligations are partly funded by pension liability insurances

pension benefits outside germany
pension benefits outside germany mainly exist in the usa the united kingdom and switzerland

in the usa there are pension obligations from various pension plans that were closed in succession
up to december 31 2000 no further benefits are earned from a defined benefit pension plan for
periods of service after the respective closure date oldage and survivors benefits accrued at the
closure date of the respective plan were fixed on the basis of pensionable income at the closure date
benefits may be paid out in the form of annuities or lumpsum payments existing pension
obligations are partly funded by plan assets the assets are held separately from the company in an
external trust the companies have appointed independent trustees in accordance with statutory
provisions to manage the funding of obligations and the investment of assets according to the
companys specifications any funding deficit is established annually in accordance with legal
requirements and spread over a fixed time period if required the statutory basis for minimum funding
was last amended in 2012 by the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21

in the united kingdom there are pension obligations from two uk pension plans one of which has
been closed for a number of years and applies exclusively to former employees the second plan is
closed to new employees but continues to provide oldage and survivors benefits to the currently
active participants based on pensionable income in the year before the employment relationship
ends these benefits are funded by salarydependent employee contributions to plan assets the

         notes to the consolidated financial statements  consolidated balance sheet disclosures equity and liabilities




      accrued entitlements and current benefits in the united kingdom are adjusted in accordance with
      statutory requirements on the basis of inflation pension obligations from both plans are partly
      funded by plan assets the companies appointed independent trustees in accordance with statutory
      provisions to manage the funding of obligations and the investment of assets according to the
      companys specifications company pension plans are valued every three years in accordance with
      legal requirements and any deficit is established if the plan is underfunded the trustee prepares a
      funding plan to regulate the funding of the deficit taking account of the actuarys recommendation
      and the type and circumstances of the respective plan

      in switzerland there are pension obligations from the second pillar of the swiss pension system the
      compulsory occupational pension plan implementation is by means of foundations that are independent
      from the companies employers and employees pay incomedependent contributions to the foundations
      interest is applied in accordance with legal provisions to the individual amounts saved and on
      retirement the total is converted into an oldage invalidity and survivors pension based on
      predetermined annuity tables investment and management of the assets is guided by the statutory
      provisions on occupational pension plans due to significant legal requirements concerning the design
      of pension plans companies only have a small number of options available to them for varying the
      design eg level of employee contribution level of contributions according to age band a board of
      trustees comprising employer and employee representatives decides on the distribution of surpluses
      or on changes to the design of the plan within the legal framework the plans come under the bundes
      gesetz √ºber die berufliche vorsorge bvg  swiss federal law on occupational benefits which
      regulates the minimum benefits to be provided by companies by defining the minimum contributions
      required and the returns on them the gea group companies that are affected by this have insured
      their employees with the axa winterthur group foundation all employers may have to contribute
      stabilization payments if there is insufficient cover for the obligations no stabilization plan is
      required at present as the cover is currently sufficient

      supplementary healthcare benefits
      in addition to occupational pension benefits certain retired employees are granted health insurance
      subsidies new entitlements to health insurance subsidies are no longer granted there are now only
      a few employees with such benefits in active employment existing obligations are not funded by
      plan assets gea group does not see these benefits posing a particular risk due to the low level of the
      obligations

      obligations under supplementary healthcare benefits relate solely to germany

particularly in germany gea group has decided to utilize the internal financing effect of the pension
provisions and supplementary healthcare benefits and only to fund a relatively small proportion of
the pension obligations using plan assets

in the usa the united kingdom and switzerland a large proportion of the pension obligations is
funded by plan assets in accordance with the legal framework the above table shows how the plan
assets have been invested a proportion of both the german and foreign plan assets is managed by
insurance companies in accordance with their specific investment guidelines in germany this is the
predominant form of investment for plan assets part of the plan assets of german pension plans is
also managed by pension funds and an endowment fund and is mainly invested in fixedincome
securities and term deposits with only a relatively small proportion invested in equities the
objective of these external investments is to ensure secure returns and preserve the value of the
underlying assets in order to fund current and future pension benefits there are currently no plans
to change this investment strategy

assets invested in the capital markets are exposed to general capital market and investment risk
gea group is constantly monitoring market trends and has developed corresponding investment
policies that adequately balance risk and income expectations while taking the respective statutory
and regulatory frameworks into account

in fiscal year 2016 eur 4194 thousand is expected to be added to the plan assets of german pension
plans and eur 4445 thousand to plans outside germany

the actual return on plan assets in 2015 was eur 2358 thousand previous year eur 12607 thousand

      actuarial assumptions
      as of the relevant reporting date the following weighted actuarial assumptions were used to
      calculate the present value of the defined benefit obligations these assumptions are used to calculate
      net pension expenses in the following year

                                                                                          12312015                12312014

      the actuarial measurement factors for german plans are established by gea group in consultation
      with actuarial experts the corresponding assumptions for plans outside germany are determined
      taking into account countryspecific conditions with the help of local experts in consultation with the
      global experts and gea group the discount rate is established using a recognized method based on
      the return on high quality corporate bonds determined as of the reporting date taking into account
      the currency and maturities of the underlying liabilities for countries that do not have a liquid
      market in corporate bonds that are suitable for setting the discount rate interest rates on government
      bonds are referred to instead to define the rate

      all other assumptions correspond to the longterm expectations of gea group the nominal rate of
      wage and salary increases is calculated based on expected inflation and a real rate of increase the
      rate of pension increases in germany is also determined based on inflation provided that the pension
      adjustments are determined in accordance with the rise in the cost of living in addition the financial
      position of the relevant company is also taken into account if a firm pension adjustment commitment
      has been made this is taken into account accordingly outside of germany the pension adjustment is
      also generally determined on the basis of inflation the growth rate assumed for the costs of
      supplementary healthcare benefits in germany equates to forecast inflation plus a growth rate based
      on historical data based on this data the growth rate is not expected to change in the future

      as in the previous year klaus heubecks 2005g mortality tables were used as a basis for measuring
      all german plans as of december 31 2015 on this basis the life expectancy of a 65yearold pensioner
      as of the reporting date is 1917 years for men and 2323 years for women previous year 2162 years
      2401 years countryspecific measurement bases were used for pension liabilities outside germany

      the sensitivities presented below apply to the discount rate and inflation which have been identified
      as actuarial assumptions that have a significant influence on gea groups benefit obligations since
      the wage and salary increase rate the pension increase rate and the growth rate in the cost of
      supplementary health benefits are derived from inflation sensitivity to inflation was used to measure
      the sensitivity of these assumptions together the same calculation methods were used for sensitivities
      as for the recognized provisions the ranges used to compute the sensitivities of the assumptions are
      based on the changes that are deemed possible until the next reporting date given historical

733           defined contribution pension plans
various companies  especially in the usa and scandinavia  operate defined contribution pension plans
under these plans the obligation does not lie with gea group but with the respective pension funds
contributions from continuing operations totaling eur 17084 thousand were paid in fiscal year 2015
previous year eur 17008 thousand contributions from continuing operations of eur 45174 thousand
were paid to state pension insurance systems previous year eur 43188 thousand these contributions
are recognized as personnel expenses at the same time as the relevant service is rendered

two multiemployer pension plans operated by several employers in the netherlands were recognized as
defined contribution pension plans because the respective managers of the plans do not provide

      performance share plan
      effective july 1 2006 gea group aktiengesellschaft launched a longterm remuneration program
      entitled gea performance share plan a cashsettled sharebased payment plan for all first and
      secondlevel managers below the executive board thirdlevel managers were also eligible to
      participate starting with the third tranche of the program as of july 1 2008 the tenth tranche was
      issued on november 26 with the subscription period ending january 31 2016 the goal of the gea
      performance share plan is to link managers remuneration with the longterm success of the
      company and to align their interests with those of the shareholders

      under the plan participants are granted a defined number of performance shares at the beginning of
      the performance period the number of performance shares allotted is determined by the
      participants management level to participate in the plan managers must invest 20 percent of the
      amount of the allotted performance shares in shares of gea group aktiengesellschaft the personal
      investment must then be held for three years performance period the tenth tranche has a 31month
      vesting period from the date of grant

      the performance of gea group aktiengesellschafts shares relative to the companies included in a
      benchmark index over the threeyear performance period is measured on the basis of their total
      shareholder return tsr the mdax was used as the benchmark for the tranches issued in the years
      up to and including 2013 the benchmark for the tranches issued in 2014 and 2015 is the stoxx
      europe tmi industrial engineering tmi ie this change in the benchmark index has harmonized
      the plan with the sharebased payments for executive board members tsr is a suitable indicator for
      investors to compare the performance and appeal of different companies it measures the total
      percentage return that an investor earns from a share over a certain period in addition to share price
      performance dividends and adjustments such as share splits are included in the calculation of tsr
      this method of comparison eliminates share price performance that is due to general market
      volatility and enables the effects of different profit retention strategies to be compared the relative
      performance of gea group aktiengesellschafts shares determines the number of performance
      shares finally paid out between 0 percent and 300 percent

      the performance shares are paid out once the threeyear performance period has expired at that
      time the performance of gea group aktiengesellschafts shares relative to the benchmark
      determines how many performance shares are paid out if the performance of the companys shares
      equals the median in the tsr comparison 50 percent of the performance shares are issued if it
      reaches the third quartile 100 percent of the performance shares are paid out if gea group aktien
      gesellschafts shares outperform the benchmark index companies 300 percent of the performance
      shares are issued other performance figures are interpolated between these values the total amount

      phantom shares
      a longterm incentive component was added to the bonus arrangements for executive board
      members in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 under this half of the bonus was payable with the regular
      salary payment and the other half was converted into phantom shares of the company it was
      calculated as the arithmetic mean of the daily closing prices of gea group shares in xetra trading
      operated by the frankfurt stock exchange on the trading days in the threemonth period that ended
      one month before the date of the supervisory board meeting convened in fiscal year 2015 to adopt
      the financial statements

      the payout value of the phantom shares is calculated following the expiration of a lockup period of
      three years following the conversion into phantom shares the amount of the payout is calculated as
      the arithmetic mean of the daily closing prices of gea group aktiengesellschaft shares in xetra
      trading operated by the frankfurt stock exchange on the trading days in the threemonth period that
      ends one month before the date of the relevant supervisory board meeting convened to adopt the
      financial statements in the fiscal year in which the lockup period expires the dividends payable per
      share during the lockup period are added to the value calculated in this way the amount to be paid
      out under these arrangements is limited to 300 percent of the annual basic bonus in the event of
      termination of the executive board members contract of service the threeyear vesting period is
      reduced to one year as from the date of termination

      because the exercise price is zero and this sharebased payment program does not feature a vesting
      period the fair value of the phantom shares corresponds to the quoted market price of gea group
      aktiengesellschaft shares the fair value of the liability for the 2011 tranche is calculated by multiplying
      the number of phantom shares by the relevant closing price plus dividends paid during the lockup
      period the 2011 tranche was paid out in full in fiscal year 2015 at a payout price of eur 3892

      the number of phantom shares changed as follows in fiscal year 2015

      in fiscal year 2015 expenses of eur 38 thousand previous year eur 180 thousand were recognized
      in respect of phantom shares the liability as of december 31 2015 amounted to eur 0 thousand
      previous year eur 2355 thousand in the previous year the corresponding amount was reported
      in current employee benefit obligations under bonuses whereby the relevant price for the phantom
      shares issued in fiscal year 2011 was eur 3830

      longterm share price component
      the longterm share price component was introduced as part of the revision of the variable
      remuneration system for executive board members in fiscal year 2012 the payout from the long
      term share price component is measured over a threeyear performance period that includes the
      relevant fiscal year and the two subsequent years

performance is measured by comparing the performance of the gea share price adjusted for dividends
with the performance of the stoxx europe tmi industrial engineering tmi ie index over a three
year performance period this comparison is computed on the basis of the respective arithmetic mean
closing prices on the last 20 trading days preceding the start of the threeyear performance period
100 percent of the target is achieved if the performance of the arithmetic mean of the gea share daily
closing prices is equal to 100 percent of the corresponding tmi performance over the threeyear
performance period in the event of outperformance greater than 100 percent the amount paid out rises
to a maximum of 300 percent of the target amount if the increase in geas share price over the three
year period is less than 100 percent of the growth in the tmi ie the amount payable will be reduced
accordingly down to a performance level of 75 percent for each percentage point higher or lower than
a 100 percent performance level the degree of target achievement will rise or fall by 4 percent the total
degree of target achievement and thus the payout level for the longterm share price component is
limited to 300 percent of this target amount cap

starting from a target amount of eur 1825 thousand previous year eur 1793 thousand the fair
value of claims arising from the longterm share price component amounted to eur 2391 thousand
previous year eur 2664 thousand as of the reporting date the 2012 tranche was paid out in fiscal

      the fair values of the financial instruments recognized under assets held for sale and liabilities held
      for sale are not presented separately since their carrying amounts represent reasonable
      approximations of their fair value

      financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value or for which a fair value is disclosed in
      the notes to the consolidated financial statements are required to be categorized according to the fair
      value hierarchy described in the following categorization within the levels of the fair value
      hierarchy is based on the measurement of the underlying inputs

      level 1 inputs quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical financial assets and
      liabilities

      level 2 inputs quoted market prices that are observable as direct prices or indirect derived from
      prices inputs used to measure fair value and that are not quoted prices as defined by level 1

      level 3 inputs inputs that are not based on observable market data

      the following table shows the categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities into the three
      level fair value hierarchy

      there were no transfers into or out of the levels of the fair value hierarchy in fiscal year 2015

      the fair value of the bond and the other financial assets is calculated on the basis of quoted bid prices
      on an active market and is therefore categorized within level 1 the fair value includes the interest
      deferred as of the reporting date

      the fair value of derivatives is calculated using quoted exchange rates and yield curves observable in
      the market accordingly these are categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy




200                                                                  gea annual report 2015

    notes to the consolidated financial statements  consolidated balance sheet disclosures equity and liabilities




the fair value of borrowers note loans and liabilities to banks is measured on the basis of the yield
curve taking into account credit spreads they are therefore categorized within level 2 of the fair
value hierarchy the interest deferred as of the reporting date is included in the fair values

the fair values of trade receivables cash and cash equivalents term deposits and other financial
receivables essentially correspond to the carrying amounts this is due to the predominantly short
remaining maturities

certain other financial liabilities resulting from the sale of the gea hx segment are categorized within
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy since their fair value is measured on the basis of the present value of
future cash outflows expected on the basis of contractual obligations associated with the sale

financial liabilities resulting from contingent purchase price considerations are assigned to level 3

served exclusively to hedge interest rate risks from longterm financing cash flow hedges in the
previous year foreign currency risks from future sale and procurement transactions were also
included in cash flow hedges fair value hedges are recognized to hedge changes in the fair value of
assets liabilities or firm commitments as in the previous year the group had not entered into any
fair value hedges as of december 31 2015

derivatives are measured at fair value which is split into an effective and an ineffective portion the
effective portion and any change in this amount are recognized in other comprehensive income until
the hedged item is recognized in the balance sheet the ineffective portion is recognized in the
income statement when the hedged item is recognized in the balance sheet gains and losses
recognized in equity are realized and the hedge is unwound in the case of a sale transaction the
effective portion is recognized as revenue whereas in the case of a procurement transaction the cost
is adjusted accordingly in the case of interest rate derivatives the gains and losses recognized in
equity are reversed to net interest income

as of december 31 2015 the complete group recognized gains of eur 0 thousand previous
year eur 5576 thousand and losses of eur 2023 thousand previous year eur 13030 thousand
from currency and interest rate derivatives directly in equity

recognized in the income statement due to the hedged items being recognized in the balance sheet
and eur 8753 thousand previous year eur 3497 thousand was offset against the cost of assets
the amounts recognized in the income statement resulted in an increase in revenue of eur 1742
thousand previous year eur 1545 thousand in addition gains of eur 7744 thousand previous
year gains of eur 5419 thousand and losses of eur 14099 thousand previous year losses of
eur 7012 thousand were reported in net exchange rate gainslosses eur 0 thousand previous

      hedged the derivatives are recognized in the income statement at the same time as the hedged items
      are recognized in the income statement and balance sheet if financial liabilities from procurement
      transactions are hedged the derivatives are recognized in the income statement when the purchased
      goods or services are recognized in the income statement

      account for tax purposes section 27 of the k√∂rperschaftsteuergesetz kstg  german corporate income
      tax act and therefore without deduction of investment income tax and the solidarity surcharge in the
      case of shareholders in germany the dividend is not subject to current taxation in the year of payment
      the opinion of the german tax authorities see also the federal ministry of finance bmf circular
      dated december 22 2009 paragraph 92 is that the payment of dividends from the contribution account
      for tax purposes constitutes a repayment of shareholder contributions which results in a retrospective
      reduction in the cost of the shares this can lead to the imposition of higher capital gains taxes if the
      shares are sold at a later date

general
further legal proceedings or official investigations have been or may be instituted against gea group
companies as a result of earlier business disposals and operating activities

adequate provisions have been recognized for all risks arising from both the legal disputes described
above and other legal disputes being pursued by gea group in the course of its ordinary operating
activities however the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of
certainty it is therefore possible that the conclusion of the proceedings may result in expenses that
exceed the amounts that may have been set aside for them




10      segment reporting
101 change in the structure of the operating segments

following intensive preparations geas new group structure  which was developed as part of its
fit for 2020 initiative  was implemented on june 8 2015 as part of this new structure the
development and manufacturing of products and the provision of process solutions have been
bundled in two new business areas  equipment and solutions

the groups operating segments were reorganized accordingly during the reporting period thus the
former gea mechanical equipment and gea farm technologies segments were allocated to the
business area equipment while gea process engineering now belongs to the business area
solutions the former gea refrigeration technologies segment was split between the business areas
equipment and solutions with the goodwill attributable to the former segment being reallocated
based on the relative values as of the reorganization date

the administrative functions bundled in the global corporate center and the shared service center
do not constitute separate operating segments their income and expenses and assets and liabilities
are charged to the business areas if allocatable activities that are not part of core business are not
disclosed in the figures for the business areas this includes investment property held for sale
pension obligations and liabilities related to discontinued operations the former gea heat
exchangers segment which was sold on october 31 2014 is also not an operating segment unlike
the previous year the figures for gea heat exchangers will no longer appear in segment reporting
the priorperiod information was adjusted to reflect the amended reporting structure
