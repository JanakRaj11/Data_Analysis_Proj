the digitareal concept delivers dreams
and excitement to all



                         creation of the entirely new digitareal concept
                  sega has acted as an entertainment professional under the company credo of creation is our life creating play that delivers dreams and excitement
                  to all the peoples of the world
                  with the proliferation of digital terminals digital content has become a more immediate presence for people today we have declared the new concept
                  of digitareal signifying the union of the digital and the real two areas of entertainment that sega has cultivated to date and it is a concept that
                  could only be created because it was housed in the sega flagship center tokyo joypolis we will continue working to build new shapes and forms of
                  entertainment in order to bring you dreams and excitement

           attractions of the reborn tokyo joypolis
           it delivers a totally new extraordinary experience
     our idea for the basis of this latest renovation was to try to provide something that could only be experienced here the
     answer we arrived at was the concept of digitareal which signifies the fusion of the digital and the real you could say
     this is the combination of an affinity that has been built up uniquely by sega with a direction that is going to become its aim
     in other words this takes the technology for imagery the digital refined in games and joins it as one with the world of actual
     objects the real that we find unfolding in amusement centers by uniting these in one we were able to create spaces and
     atmospheres where you could be in an extraordinary world that nobody had ever experienced before

what we expect from smiletouch
                                                when treating a child it is necessary to give a genuine explanation not only to the childs guardians but also to the child this is
                                                true from the ethical perspective childrens rights as well children who are given a genuine explanation will become aware of
                                                their own situations to their own individual capacities and so become able to take a more positive view in the clinical setting
                                                therefore we try a variety of devices such as picturecard shows and dolls to explain things to the children the animated medical

     several of my friends from university days were hit by the                  i participated out of a feeling that i wanted to be of some use          i joined the volunteers out of a desire to witness for myself the
 disaster and even though i gave some small aid by making                   however little but when i went to the actual place is when i truly       damage from the unprecedented earthquake the actual menace of
 donations it seemed to me that in such an unprecedented disaster          sensed the reality of it for the first time when the people in the       nature and magnitude of the damage far exceeded what i
 there should be something more i could do as a person so i joined          affected area called out their appreciation for our help i got goose     imagined while sensing the limits of what any individual has the
 the volunteers as we worked i couldnt help but think how                 bumps i was filled with eagerness to complete our work as fast as        strength to do about it i also discovered that bringing individual
 griefstricken the home owners must be considering how peaceful            possible there are still many people there who need the help of          strengths together can be a start to accomplishing something it
 and quiet their lives must have been before march 11 i think it will       volunteers so i certainly hope that group employees will take part       seems likely that recovery is going to take some time yet the issue
 be important to maintain a continuing posture of support                   in the effort                                                            that will need to be faced i think is how to sustain the kind of

      i have been seeing frequent reports in the media lately about              there are buildings that nobody has been able to get to even              by participating in the volunteer activity i feel that i recovered
 how the number of people volunteering in the disasteraffected              after half a year so i felt again and very keenly how much more        a kind of pure caring of a kind i felt in childhood the world today is
 area has diminished so i decided to take the opportunity to                time recovery is going to require the three days i spent in the effort   a hard place to be and i felt how invigorating it is to work to make
 participate the individual is very weak but i felt how important it       were such a little drop in the bucket that i felt sorry about it but     somebody happy rather than thinking only about making money to
 will be to put our own individual strength together with that of other      when a local person who had been helping us thanked me directly           those of you who have not taken part in volunteer work i want to
 volunteers and continue the volunteer work it is going to require          on the last day my feelings were resolved the local people were         say that the threshold to volunteer activity is not high
 considerably more time and people power before true recovery can            even stronger in their resolve than we realized
 take place i intend to tell the people around me about this
 experience and expand the circle of assistance however much i am
 able

     for me on my own volunteer activity presented a high hurdle to
 overcome so i felt greatly encouraged to be able to join in with
 other group employees partly i felt uncertainty about the physical
 labor involved but it turned out that there were actually many jobs
 that women can handle when we were working on collecting the
 rubble from sites where the tsunami had washed the houses away
 i would dig and dig and keep turning up more and more glass until
 i thought it would never end but i do feel that i was able to
 contribute to recovery in some measure however small

promoting employment of persons with disabilities and rehiring of retirees
   sammy takes part in joint interviews at job fairs held for people with disabilities by public and private
employment agencies and actively hires from this population as a result employees with disabilities made
up 194 of our workforce as of march 31 2012
   guided by the revised act for stabilization of employment of older persons we introduced a retiree
rehiring system in 2006 since then we have rehired persons reaching the mandatory retirement age for up
to five years if they so wished




an environment for working with confidence

   sammy introduced a group longterm disability insurance program in april 2011 to compensate for
income lost if illness or injury prevents an employee from working because employees are our greatest
assets we implemented a way for the company to absorb part of the risk of being unable to work so that
employees can work with confidence

   there were seven occupational accidents in fiscal 2012 fewer than in the previous year however the
number occurring while on duty increased so we are taking measures to investigate the cause and make
improvements in the workplaces where such accidents occur
at the kawagoe factory 6s refers to safety plus five japanese terms all starting with the letter s relating to orderliness cleanliness
and discipline 6s patrols aim to promote a good working environment by looking at health and safety issues



promoting mental health care
   we believe that prevention is the most important form of mental health care this includes better self
check functions with a web tool that helps employees monitor their own stress levels furthermore as an
example of enhanced line care all managers received mental health management training in fiscal 2011 to
raise their awareness and more quickly recognize changes in their subordinates conditions superiors seek
to improve the working environment and the company provides a system for consulting with an occupational
physician or outside medical organization so that illness can be detected and treated early on finally when
employees return from leave their immediate supervisors an occupational physician and the personnel
department collaborate to ensure they get allround support
   sammy is improving its employee health management program by providing health interviews as
designated by an occupational physician or nurse based on the results of an annual medical exam an
occupational physician or nurse is always available for consultation during work hours




      being considerate enough to help out at work and home
      we learned and experienced a lot by taking childcare leave at home we saw how hard it is for one person to
      do the housework and childcare which gave us new appreciation for our wives and an understanding of how
      important it is to help each other all the time at work we also appreciate our superiors colleagues and others
      who supported us and we sensed the importance of having an environment where we can back each other up
      in our work finally we became aware of how precious it is above all to have consideration both at home and
      at work we look forward to having such consideration and actively helping out our wives and colleagues when                                genta atobe                           atsunori kondo

with employees



                   motivating our employees
                   a personnel system that gives all employees a professional attitude
                          to promote a sense of professionalism and the will to take on challenges among our employees one
                   program offers them different career paths and lets them choose independently with both management and
                   specialist paths we are fostering greater expertise and more clearly defining job roles
                          we are also implementing a new personnel system in fiscal 2013 through the new system we aim to clarify
                   the role expected of each employee treat employees properly in accordance with their contribution to success
                   in that role and draw out each employees best performance by recompensing their motivation and results


                   fair evaluations
                          qualifications and requirements for each type of job are clearly spelled out and employees are evaluated
                   and treated fairly in keeping with the roles and responsibilities entrusted to them to make sure that
                   evaluations are fair moreover we evaluate not only results but also the processes that led to those results
                   which encourages each employees autonomy


                   selfdeclaring system
                          under our selfdeclaring system employees can provide input on the level of motivation and satisfaction
                   they have with their jobs and state their preferences for career challenges eg job transfers they would
                   like to take on in future this helps to foster each employee and elicits the ambition to accept challenges so
                   that people are placed in more appropriate positions

                   enhancement of systematic educational systems
                          following our personnel management policy that the organization will take responsibility for fostering
                   members until they develop their full talents sammy provides training programs for each rank of employee
                   after they join the company and offers opportunities for talent development in fiscal 2011 we updated and
                   enhanced the content of training by breaking down the rankbased training that we had been giving into
                   even more specific units

our stance
as a good corporate citizen the group recognizes the need to tackle environmental issues in 2006 the group commissioned an
external environmental research firm to assess the potential environmental impacts of its manufacturing processes products and
services while it did not identify any serious environmental risks we nonetheless decided to undertake a range of measures to step
up compliance with environmental laws and use resources and energy more efficiently we have taken steps to enlighten all
employees about environmental issues so they can act accordingly in their private lives global environmental issues manifested as
climate change and other chronic issues require an urgent response and it is critical for enterprises to keep voluntarily and
proactively working to protect the environment the sega sammy group code of conduct mandates three things from our
employees to ensure that business activities are conducted appropriately in consideration of the global environment we make sure
each group employee understands how to help out as an individual as we work to protect the global environment

using the woods to reduce co2


sustained protection of our rich natural environment
each year we provide employees with the experience of maintaining seganomori
under the direction of the villagers who have protected and raised it day to day this
is a chance to learn how important and difficult the work is and to think about the
importance of this forest to global environmental protection
as they experience actual weeding cleancutting and thinning the participants
communicate with villagers in each process and think deeply about the indirect
impacts our business activities have on the forest and each persons connection to
it when our employees return to their ordinary roles they have a proactive and
specific awareness of the environment which they can then put into action

                    sega could not do business without using electricity which is an indirect source of co2 emissions when we were studying how
                    to practice corporate social responsibility by addressing our environmental impact we learned about the forest adoption program
                    then nagano prefecture introduced us to the village of minamiaiki and seganomori was born five years later we are already
        halfway through our partnership contract initially i just thought of it as a way to offset co2 but ive changed now whenever i get that warm
        feeling from interacting with the wonderful natural environment and people here i think ive come home to minamiaiki as they experience
        how much nature provides for usagricultural crops fish water and airmy hope is that event participants will be more aware of the
        relationships our lives and businesses have with nature i hope to continue fostering and using seganomori to increase environmental
        awareness among our citydwelling employees and families so that we achieve the ideal forest the children of minamiaiki village

          commenting on the sega sammy groups report last year i hoped                particularly sympathized with the comments from your employee
       to draw attention to the impact of decision making and activities on             volunteers who took part in earthquake relief
       society and the environment i wrote that i wanted to see the group                  as the report notes the sega sammy group acquired phoenix
       proactively talking about the opportunities for bringing about positive          resort kk operator of one of the top resort facilities in japan phoenix
       impacts it has the potential to make and i hoped there would be wider           seagaia resort i can imagine the sega sammy group moving into the
       recognition in the group about the concerns society has                         next stage of its history as it adds this new business domain this is
          the group management philosophy of the sega sammy group is                   likely to demand even stronger compliance efforts it may also create a
       by providing entertainment filled with dreams and excitement to people          need for you to recognize members of society other than your
       throughout the world we will strive to enrich our society and culture a       customers as stakeholders people will also expect you to make social
       statement that itself expresses societys expectations this years report       contributions beyond supporting activities like sports and the arts
       sends a clear message that the csr you aim to practice is the                    getting each of your employees independently engaged in achieving
       continuous pursuit of that same philosophy                                      new policies will get them all working for the same goals and in that
          i understood from this that the idea our core business is our               way you will achieve csr
       opportunity for bringing about positive impacts is a characteristic of
       csr at the sega sammy group i was also impressed by what your top              mr adachi graciously provided his opinion for a second straight year these are the views presented by a third party
                                                                                       regarding the corporate social responsibility csr activities and related information disclosure of the sega sammy
       management had to say about the great east japan earthquake that              group as understood from this report through the perspective of someone engaged in providing financial institutions
                                                                                       with corporate information for the purpose of socially responsible investment these comments do not express a
       the next thing that is most needed is psychological care i believe that       determination as to whether or not this report has been prepared according to generally accepted standards for
                                                                                       creating environmental and other such reports nor that the measurements involved are accurate and the
       entertainment has the power to deliver vitality to tomorrow and can            computations correct nor that all important matters are presented without omission

       play an important role in nourishing the soul




response to thirdparty opinion
  i would like to thank mr adachi for his opinion of the sega sammy group                  mr adachi also mentioned compliance which is fundamental to corporate
csr report 2012                                                                          governance we are doing more awareness raising with our officers than ever
  one major issue we contended with in fiscal 2012 was to answer what we                  before but we know better than to say we have done enough therefore we
as a business providing entertainment filled with dreams and excitement can             will continue to take all types of opportunities to ensure thorough compliance
do for victims of the great east japan earthquake but our officers and staff
were more active in volunteer relief and support initiatives than we had
expected these initiatives also inspired an awareness of corporate social
responsibility among our employees we will continue volunteer activities
