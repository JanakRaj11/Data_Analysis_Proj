leading in valuebased healthcare
traditional healthcare systems are based on payments for products and
services rather than results this can lead to rising healthcare costs and
suboptimal patient outcomes we advocate for a valuebased healthcare
vbhc system in which payment is based on the ability of products and
services to improve patient outcomes relative to their cost
our current vbhc offerings fall under three categories therapy
