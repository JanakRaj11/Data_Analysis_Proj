a message from the vice president forestry and environment




at canfor we have a great story of sustainability to share and this year we hope to
share more of it with you than we have in the past bringing you a more detailed look
at our efforts in the areas of health and safety forestry operations manufacturing and
community involvement we hope youll see that we view sustainability as something
that extends beyond the environment into the homes of our employees and throughout
the global community as well
as always safety remains our number one priority the safety of our employees is para
mount and every year we examine our safety program and identify specific areas where
we can improve in 2010 we focused on risk assessment and hazard awareness our
efforts resulted in an improvement to our injury rate and further solidified our position
as the safest forestry company in canada
we continued to practice sustainable forest management in our forest tenures in 2010
by planting more than double the number of trees we harvested  30 million trees  and
ensuring that at least 90 survive we are making sure the forests under our care will
continue to benefit the environment in the years to come while maintaining a sustain
able business
2010 also saw canfor join in the creation of the canadian boreal forest agreement this
historic accord between a group of canadian forest products companies environmental
nongovernmental organizations and the forest products association of canada is a
groundbreaking achievement in conservation and resource management i encourage
you to read more about the agreement and its goals in this document
on the manufacturing side we continued our strategy to reduce our carbon footprint by
installing barkfired heat energy systems that replace natural gas use this means we
are utilizing close to 100 of wood residues generated during the lumber manufacturing
process and also reducing our carbon footprint
i should take this opportunity to thank the communities where we operate for their
support throughout the prolonged downturn from which we are only now beginning to
emerge in 2010 canfor saw four consecutive quarters of profit for the first time since
2006 there are still many challenges that we must overcome and some of our opera
tions remain indefinitely closed however we remain committed to the communities in
which we operate
canfor continued to make strategic donations in the communities where we operate
focusing on youth and education community enhancement forestry and environment
amateur sports and health and wellness our employees specifically deserve credit for
their generosity donating more than 245000 to the united way this amounts to a
48000 increase over the 2009 fundraising campaign
this sustainability report continues a longstanding tradition of transparency at canfor
we continue to voluntarily share any compliance issues we have encountered throughout
the year confident that the matters were remedied promptly and actions were taken to
ensure they do not happen in the future

safety comes first at canfor

our philosophy can be found proudly displayed on the walls of our
operations across north america it reminds us that our top priority
is the wellbeing of our employees our bottom line is not just about
financial capitalits about the health of our workforce first and
foremost this concept is ingrained in our corporate culture our
success stems from our efforts to continually strive to improve our
programs and develop best practices by studying other industrial
safety programs and sharing information and ideas throughout our
organization

in 2010 we developed a risk assessment workshop whose aim was
to heighten the hazard awareness of our employees we trained
safety representatives in each division who delivered the workshop
to employees by consistently highlighting the importance of risk
assessment and hazard awareness in the workplace we ensure that
our workforce continues to be the safest in the industry

further improving the safety of our employees depends on effective
communication and that is one of the things we do best canfor
holds weekly conference calls between the safety leaders of each
division to discuss challenges and solutions and exchange ideas

our commitment to leading the industry in health and safety is
reflected in our low injury rate we continued to have the lowest
injury rate in the canadian forest industry this year with a rate of
062 companywide our injury rate is less than one third the average
of the forest products industry

forestry report
at the heart of canfors forestry operations is its forest management
system fms the fms is a systematic means of identifying address
ing and managing environmental impacts and sustainable forest
management commitments within canfors woodlands operations

the goal of the system is to maintain and enhance the long term
health of forest ecosystems for the benefit of all living things both lo
cally and globally while providing environmental economic and social
opportunities for the benefit of both present and future generations


sustainable forest management certification

canfor continues to be a leader in sustainable forest management
certification practices in the forest that we manage are covered by
our fms which is independently certified to the latest version of the
international organization for standardization iso environmental
management system ems standard cancsaiso 140012004 the
iso ems standard offers guidelines for the implementation
maintenance and continual improvement of our environmental
management systems

in addition to ems certification 967 of our allowable annual cut
under forest tenures is independently certified to the canadian
standards association csa standard for sustainable forest

                                                                           canfor corporation sustainability report 2010   11




management cancsaz80902 the csa sustainable forest
management standard requires high levels of public input and
detailed sciencebased plans to monitor and if necessary improve
upon such sustainability markers as biological diversity and the
conservation of soil and water resources the standard also requires
us to improve our sustainability outcomes every year

as of 2010 canfor has 16 facilities certified to the programme for
the endorsement of forest certification schemes pefc chain of
custody of forest based productsrequirements standard pefc
certification gives our customers the confidence that canfor products
come from certified forests by adhering to the chain of custody
canfor commits to tracking every piece of lumber that comes from
our mills from the forest of origin and through every step of the
manufacturing process


reforestation

wood products are the very definition of a renewable resource while
forests naturally regenerate canfor is active in replanting and tend
ing our forest tenures we plant more than double the number of
trees we harvest in 2010 we replanted 23750 hectares of harvested
area in bc and alberta alone  thats 30 million trees with a survival
rate of more than 90

when harvesting planting or building roads to access timber we
aim to promote such forest values as diversity wildlife habitat and
soil resiliency by creating detailed plans on the specific environment
of the planting area and the types of trees that are particularly well
suited to its characteristics planning for a harvest and subsequent
reforestation can take three or more years to complete

wildlife and habitat management

in 2010 canfor continued to implement conservation plans for
species at risk and to collaborate with provincial governments first
nations local and regional authorities environmental groups and
other stakeholders to improve our practices some of the initiatives
and new developments that were especially proud of include

canadian boreal forest agreement in may 2010 canfor signed a
historic accord the canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa this
agreement is a collaboration between 21 forest products companies
including canfor 9 environmental non government organizations
engos and the forest products association of canada fpac

the signatories to this agreement wish to demonstrate leadership
in developing and implementing a globally significant model for
conservation and resource management in canadas boreal forest in
a manner that sets the stage for joint action in relation to both boreal
forest conservation and forest sector competitiveness

there is much work yet to be done to achieve the goals and objectives
that are the underpinning of this agreement but significant progress
is being made

                                                                          canfor corporation sustainability report 2010   12
the goals of the cbfa

  1   worldleading boreal ontheground sustainable forest 		
       management practices based on the principles of ecosystem
       based management active adaptive management and third
       party verification of sustainable practices

  2   the completion of a network of protected areas that taken as
       a whole represents the diversity of ecosystems within the 		
       boreal region and serves to provide ecological benchmarks

  3   the recovery of species at risk within the boreal forest includ
       ing species such as woodland caribou

  4   reducing greenhouse gas emissions along the full life cycle
       from forest to end of product life

  5   improved prosperity of the canadian forest sector and the
       communities that depend on it

  6   recognition by the marketplace eg customers investors
       consumers of the cbfa and its implementation in ways that
       demonstrably benefit fpac members and their products from
       the boreal forest

canfor is actively involved in regional and national working groups
as well as the agreement steering committee and various task
teams all working towards the successful implementation of the 6
goals of the cbfa

mountain pine beetle the mountain pine beetle is an insect that lays
its eggs beneath the bark of lodgepole pine as larvae feed beneath
the bark they may kill the tree if the number of pine beetles is
significant enough they can kill wide swathes of forest in a short
time frame

canfor like many other canadian forest products companies has
seen the negative effects of the mountain pine beetle on our forest
tenures however we are making a concerted effort to harvest and
use pine trees damaged or killed by these beetles

at our woodland operations in grande prairie ab canfor is following
an aggressive plan to slow the progress of the pine beetle part of
this plan involves harvesting pine stands that are most susceptible
to pine beetle attack or that have already been infested in 2010
approximately 70 of the volume delivered to the grande prairie mill
was pine

in british columbia canfor has been harvesting pine beetle infested
forests for a decade and through replanting we are replacing dead
forests with new vibrant forests for future generations

foothills landscape management forum in 2005 canfor became
a founding member of a group whose goal was to minimize the
negative impact of the forestry oil and gas sectors on the forests of
west central alberta the foothills landscape management forum
flmf as it is now known is pioneering the concept of integrated
landscape management integrated landscape management is a
way of minimizing the impacts that commercial activity has on the
forest by coordinating with other companies across industries prov
incewide to share roads and other access in the forest members of

our forests
are playgrounds

                                                                          canfor corporation sustainability report 2010   15

the flmf not only share roads that already exist we coordinate long
term road planning and work together to restore unnecessary access
roads to their natural state this group initiative also provides for
learning opportunities and data sharing with our industry partners


road planning

canfor uses logging roads to access the working forest however
poorly planned and constructed roads can create soil erosion and
displacement if not planned and implemented properly canfors
planning process weighs costs and benefits as well as potential
environmental damage to ensure that the road is located in the most
environmentally appropriate location


recreation

since canfor operates on public land all of our tenures are open to
the public for recreational purposes our forests are playgrounds for
all kinds of different recreational activities opportunities for rock
climbing mountain biking camping and hiking are scattered across
our forest tenures in fact 60 of recreational activity on crown land
in british columbia does not happen in designated parks but in forest
tenures canfor recognizes that the forest is more than a source of
revenue for our company we confer regularly with the public and
try to integrate their concerns into our operational plans the forest
encompasses many values and outdoor recreation is one of the many
that we consider when planning our commercial activities


compliance with regulation

canfor is committed to maintaining a transparent system for envi
ronmental reporting including compliance reporting during 2010
canfors forestry operations harvested approximately 85 million m3
and experienced only five non compliance incidents on the companys
forest tenures

   inadequate deactivation leading to siltation issues

   two minor trespass occurrences

   one fire incident on an active harvest block

   not meeting silviculuture obligations in a timber supply area
    ie not meeting freetogrow and regeneration dates

in each case the company took the necessary actions to mitigate any
environmental consequences and corrective actions and minimize any
potential for similar issues arising in the future

canfor forestry operations also had one minor diesel fuel and oil spill
near a small stream resulting from a logging truck accident the
spill was contained properly cleaned up and promptly reported to the
appropriate government agencies

canfors external 2010 surveillance audit indicated seven minor non
conformities across the entire multisite ems and sfm certification
action plans developed by canfor to address the issues have been
reviewed and approved by the external auditor

                                                                        canfor corporation sustainability report 2010   16




manufacturing report
improving our performance

canfor strives to continuously improve the environmental sustainabil
ity of our manufacturing processes we pay close attention to energy
efficiency air and water quality waste volumes and greenhouse gas
emissions in order to ensure that our sawmills and pulp mills operate
according to high standards

                                                                           canfor corporation sustainability report 2010   17




carbon responsibility

we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint often by elimi
nating energy inefficiencies we can improve our mills and the environ
ment one of canfors strengths is the use of virtually all of the fibre
we harvestthis means that the portion of the trees we harvest that
is not converted into finished lumber goes to a variety of valueadded
uses including providing heat and power to our mills reducing fossil
fuel usage and purchased electricity needs


fpac carbon neutral initiative
as an active participant in the fpac sustainability initiative canfor
is committed to act in a manner that is environmentally responsible
socially desirable and economically viable as a participant in this
initiative canfor integrates these principles in our business practices
and contributes to sustainable development through continuous
improvement

the industry has set a number of targets for itself as part of this
initiative including carbon neutrality without the purchase of carbon
offset credits canfor and other industry partners are committed
to be carbon neutral by 2015 this pledge is a first for the forest
industry

to meet the 2015 target for the carbon neutral initiative fpac mem
bers will seek to minimize their carbon footprint by reducing direct
and indirect emissions increasing carbon storage potential of our
forests and products and increasing avoided emissions specifically
efforts focus on

   becoming energy selfsufficient switching from fossil fuels to
    renewable energy sources

   adopting new more energyefficient technologies

   increasing diversion of used products from landfills

   increasing the use of landfill capping systems in order to prevent
    methane leaks

   increasing cogeneration opportunities

   identifying opportunities to maintain and enhance carbon storage
    in forests through landscape planning and sustainable forest
    management practices

   maximizing recycling of paper and wood products

                                                                          canfor corporation sustainability report 2010   18
carbon offset transactions

not only has canfor been implementing projects that reduce our
carbon footprint the projects can also generate carbon emission off
set credits as a result we have been active in the emerging carbon
market in alberta and bc

grande prairie sawmill in 2010 canfor negotiated the sale of approx
imately 80000 tonnes of carbon offset credits with an alberta energy
company representing 3 years 20092012 of emission credits from
the grande prairie sawmill biomass energy project the biomass
energy project is a 22 mwe combined heat and power chp project
located adjacent to our grande prairie sawmill that commenced
operation in 2005 canfor supplies wood residuals to the power plant
and purchases renewable heat and power for our grande prairie
sawmill operation


energy systems

barkfired heat energy systems use wood residuals from the manu
facturing process to provide mill heat and dry lumber by creating
energy from the byproducts of lumber processing the new systems
reduce reliance on natural gas decrease greenhouse gas emissions
improve air quality and reduce costs

fort st john sawmill in may 2009 canfor started up an energy sys
tem at our fort st john sawmill displacing the natural gas previously
purchased to dry lumber in 2010 canfor sold approximately 12600
tonnes of carbon offset credits representing just over one years
operation of the 135 million barkfired heat energy system

mackenzie sawmill in 200910 canfor invested 15 million in an
energy system for our sawmill in mackenzie that started up in may
2010

prince george sawmill in mid2010 we broke ground on a similar
energy system at our prince george sawmill this will be the third
heat energy system that weve installed in the last two years

offset credits should arise from the mackenzie and prince george
sawmill projects in the future


compliance report
canfor is committed to transparency in our manufacturing reporting
and includes compliance reporting as part of this process the follow
ing is an inventory of compliance issues for canfors whollyowned
manufacturing operations for 2010 reported in accordance with
government reporting criteria

air

at one wood products operation the beehive burner was found to
be out of compliance due to excess opacity and the poor condition
of the burner the same burner was out of compliance with its
operating temperature requirements for 5 and 4 operating days on
separate occasions due to damper issues a warning letter was
issued by the ministry of environment for the two occasions of burner
noncompliance

effluent

one mill did not submit their annual report documenting oil water
separator sampling


landfill

one operation deposited volumes to their landfill in excess of the
annual permitted limit


spills

canfor manufacturing operations had 2 reportable spills in 2010 all
were contained cleaned up and preventive actions taken one was
a spill of gasoline due to a loose connection between a gas tank and
pump the second was a hydraulic oil spill from a broken hose on a
loader


improving our performance


canfor greenhouse gas emissions

canfors greenhouse gas emissions ghgs were less in 2010 than
prior years this was largely due to reduced natural gas usage at
northwood pulp from operational improvements

the restart of the chetwynd sawmill which currently uses natural gas
for lumber drying partially offset ghg emission reductions resulting
from a full years operation of the fort st john barkfired energy
system startup of the mackenzie mill barkfired energy system in
may 2010 has substantially reduced mackenzie ghg emissions from
prior levels

canfor will be installing barkfired energy systems at our chetwynd
and plateau mills in 201112 which will further reduce natural gas
usage and ghg emissions
