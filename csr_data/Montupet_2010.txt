                    kingdom and presented in continuing operations strategic activities at 31122008


                    this table shows a 37 turnover decrease in strategic activities and a 44 decrease of the total turnover
                    in the full year against 49 in the first half year alone

                    this shows a steady rise in volumes in the second halfyear

                    the cash flow negative at 96 million  at june 30th becomes positive at 19 million  on the year the
                    second halfyear cashflow amounts to 115  million despite a lower volume and an unfavourable mix
                    influenced by the car scrapping

                    the operating income at  17 million  by end june amounts to  2 million  in the second halfyear
                    the net result of  162 million  for the year  14 million  in the first half  is made up of  57 million 
                    for discontinued operations during the year or operations for sale wheels and of  105 million  for
                    strategic activities the wheel activity picked up dramatically thanks to improvements in productivity to
                    the virtual disappearance of depreciation and to a billing fee structure in line with actual costs




                                                                                                                                             19

                      the trend of these figures shows the relevance of the measures taken by montupet to withstand the
                      unprecedented violence of the car crisis

                               restructuring of bank debt by the postponement of maturities for three years credit lines for
                                approximately 120 million

                                the research tax credit and the carryback corresponding to fiscal years 2008 and 2007
                               halving of investment compared to previous years rate and reuse of equipment wherever possible
                               reduction of staff by 30 and heavy reliance on partial unemployment in france

                      today even if existing capacities are not all used the manufacturing facilities of montupet are well
                      balanced with the expectations of manufacturers with four factories in france and spain and three
                      lowcost plants in mexico bulgaria and the united kingdom the fonderies du poitou acquired

in france excluding wheels the plants activity has been doubly affected by the decline in registrations
and inventory reduction throughout the automotive supply chain after a first quarter extremely low
calls for deliveries have recovered gradually over small engines cylinderheads and structure parts
providing improved dynamics in particular at châteauroux it is the heavy reliance on shorttime which
helped to partially adjust the volume of hours worked in this exceptional situation at laigneville an
agreement on working arrangements was reached with the employee representative bodies to improve
the competitiveness of the site from 2010

the year 2009 has also been used to make a special effort and training to strengthen the control over
production processes improving the rate of right first time everywhere

the two manufacturing plants in belfast have experienced opposite fates the cylinder head 2 liters and
more depending on the version dedicated to the ford diesel engine has been produced at only half
the volume of the previous year while the psa diesel engine cylinder head dv 16l benefited from
the dynamism of the lower midrange car market and saw its production down only very slightly the
adjustments of wages and hours negotiated with staff representatives and a plan of 50 redundancies
enabled to adapt the organization and personnel to the circumstances

meanwhile two carousels molding available in the former factory calcast were resettled in the belfast
plant to produce the new ford cylinder gasoline engine sigma to start end of 2010

in spain the 2009 activity was 35 lower than in 2008 the plant was still prepared for the future by
managing a strong evolution of its product mix towards parts with higher added value such as turbo
charger bodies or bodies of the valve recycling exhaust gases these highgrowth components contri
bute to the reduction of engine capacity and emissions from new engines

with the support of the western european plants the bulgarian unit has continued to grow by starting
four new products and adding two new customers in serial production audi cylinderheads for the v6
engine and bmw cylinderhead of the mini the monthly tonnage has been gradually increasing from
20 to 200 tons

after a full year of production the plant received its certifications iso  ts 16949 for quality and iso14001
for environmental preservation

the mexican unit has been successfully adapted to the low load of 2009 down by 40 as compared to
2008 it has preserved its productivity and developed new products for gm and daewoo

the wheels activity was transferred to montupet sa subsidiary française de roues sas in 2009
it has continued its recovery in terms of quality and productivity and was less affected by the crisis than
the cylinderheads activity since the volume delivered is recessed by 15 as compared to 2008
the product mix has shifted towards wheels representing a higher added value

the proposed sale of the subsidiary to a group that could provide the necessary international expo
sure has been continued it accelerated in 2010 through serious discussions with the indian group
deltronix

outlook

we are seeing a widespread trend among motorists toward miniaturization and higher performance
engines in addition new functions are integrated into the cylinder head intake manifolds and exhaust
egr valve this requires more complex cylinder heads on dimensional and metallurgical fields that are
montupet areas of excellence

accordingly montupet which already has large orders for these new engines will benefit from many deve
lopment opportunities in the next four years these orders will initially saturate the existing production
facilities before a resumption of investment in capacity from 2013 using a reconstituted cash flow and thus
a new possibility of indebtedness and the cash from the sale of unused buildings the satisfactory start in
bulgaria in the difficult context of six parts to develop ascertains montupet potential for profitable high
volume production of its workload

1st quarter 2010



   activity in the first quarter of 2010 has considerably improved as compared with the first quarter of
   2009 this trend continues and grows very promisingly in april and may  june forecast

   during the first quarter of 2010 there were no significant event or transaction
   financially the situation inside the lines is very tense due to the dramatic increase in the need for
   working capital  following a sharp increase in turnover and the rapid increase aluminium price  which
   could lead us up to the debt ceiling authorized by the banks

   faced with this situation we undertook to negotiate with these same banks new developments of the
   credit agreement to give us more flexibility covenants refunds we expect to be able to give more
   details on the outcome of these negotiations in the press release for the second quarter of 2010

   on the other hand we act to reduce customer payments delays related to their desire to improve their
   cash we are shifting up all possible investments finally we request the payment of certain tools in
   advance as the volume of tools is exceptionally high for this year
   operating income has improved dramatically compared to the first quarter of 2009 in line with the
   growth in turnover as for cash flow its substantial improvement is still not sufficient to fund both a
   tedious process of investment and the exceptional growth in working capital




                                                                                                                25

                      ments following the dramatic increase in the need for working capital resulting from the surge in tur
                      nover and the rising price of aluminium

                      on another hand montupet strives to reduce the customer payments delays related to their desire to
                      improve their cash flow shifts all possible investments and seeks payment of some tooling in advance



                 risks related to the group activity

                      montupet relies entirely on automotive sales and holds 25 of the aluminium cylinderheads market
                      share out of the integrated market and around 5 of the european aluminium wheels market shares
                      automotive sales and production are seasonal and highly cyclical and depend on general economic
                      conditions consumer confidence employment trends exchange and interest rates fuel cost and dealer
                      sales incentives

                      during the last years the volume of automotive sales has fluctuated inducing delays in new engine
                      programs montupet could suffer the effects of such delays and of lower than anticipated production
                      levels whereas we develop and launch the manufacture of new parts several months in advance our
                      strategy is to systematically obtain written and binding purchase orders from our customers however
                      some of our competitors are sometimes more flexible and the customers are often bound to order a
                      portion of their requirements rather than a specific quantity

                      program terminations and cancellations are to be compensated but may be not fully or partially
                      reimbursed

                      our prices are preset whereas our costs metal and energy prices labour etc may then adversely rise
                      our parts sales prices usually decline over the term of the contract and must be compensated by
                      increases in efficiency which are difficult to achieve

                      on another hand we experience a strong constant pressure for price decreases on new parts

                      following an appeal in 2009 to the european commission by the european aluminium association
                      wheel involving primary producers of aluminium wheels about european prices of chinese wheels and
                      more specifically their supply prices of metal a 206 tax was established on chinese wheels imports
                      therefore the customers who required an alignment of these prices enable suppliers including
                      montupet subsidiary française de roues to submit bids

                      to face competition and to keep being selected by our customers we strongly and steadily manage to
                      reinforce our competitiveness our quality our ability to develop and manufacture new parts our logis
                      tic efficiency our research and development capacities our international presence and our durability

                      however the strengthening of the antipollution standards results in needs of more and more complex
                      cylinderheads which is favourable to montupet as the worldleader in the cylinderheads technology

                      montupet customers are the largest world carmanufacturers montupet was not faced with the
                      insolvency of any customer despite the crisis in the sector and the situation of general motors and
                      chrysler litigations with customers are provisioned in montupet sa accounts where they represent
                      058 of the turnover in 2009 and are of minor significance in the subsidiaries

                      aluminium is a commodity quoted on the london metal exchange at flat rate its price fluctuations
                      are passed on our customers but only after a timelag with possible adverse effects metal hedges
                      usually in place generate a risk in case of lower than expected parts deliveries

                      we reduce our dependency on aluminium supply by diversifying our sources eight suppliers in first
                      fusion and twelve suppliers in second fusion

d  environmental data


presentation and scope of the report

  this report shows the main indicators of montupet environmental policy

  included in the report are the french production sites

      our plant in châteauroux including française de roues sas as measure instrumentation could
       not detail between française de roues and montupet sa in 2009

      our plant in laigneville

  both sites are classified installations for the environmental protection

  the environmental policy in the french sites includes

  1   the application of regulations
  2   the prevention of the pollution risks
  3   the continuous optimization of every environmental issue water air waste energy and pollution
       risks prevention

  laigneville plant is fitted with a development center that includes environmental protection among its
  operating criteria
  the information provided relate to the final use of resources by montupet hence energy consump
  tion and emissions related to the production of these resources aluminium gas electricity are not
  taken into account

  the ratios indicated are per ton of melt aluminium

  in châteauroux the prototype workshop uses new sand then recycled for serial productions to the tune
  of 965 by a thermal reconditioning system with a capacity of four tons per hour and a raw sand pro
  cessing unit in 2009 the sand from the prototype workshop was covering the production needs

  in laigneville aluminium and sand consumption decreased sharply in connection with the production
  downturn 50

  laigneville plant products more cylinder heads than châteauroux and therefore uses more sand pits
  the sand is sifted and used upgraded to the tune of 95

                      in chateauroux the punctual restarting of small furnaces downgraded the ratio the increase in the

                      reducing them

                      in laigneville decreased consumption results from lower production the increased ratio is due to
                      reduced use of the ffc furnace as other sklenar furnaces have been used for small productions it is
                      also related to furnaces stops and restarts following unemployment periods
