increasing
our size
reducing
our
footprint
we conduct a yearly greenhouse gas inventory by
collecting information on our total building space
the amount of kilowatthours we use the amount
and type of refrigeration used in our stores
gallons of fuel used by our transportation fleet
and more


since conducting our baseline greenhouse gas inventory in 2007 weve added more than 95 million square
feet to our overall operation concurrently weve lowered our co2 emissions per square foot by
129 with this kind of result theres no denying our stores warehouses and offices are more energy
efficient


storefront solar panels                                                                            page 3




saving with solar
5 system installations and counting
                                        it takes quite a bit of energy to run a store which is why weve
                                        turned to solar power to aid our conservation efforts by installing
                                        solar panels in five locations we now generate nearly 150000
                                        kilowatthours kwh of power annually




  in 2014 we added new solar panels to a store in palm city florida with this addition we now have
  solar panels at four stores and one at our corporate office

recycle where you shop
                                 we encourage customers to participate in local
                                 and curbside recycling programs


                                 publix offers our customers recycling of paper
                                 and plastic bags at all of our retail locations

                                 plastic shopping bag for recycling and they can
                                 also recycle plastic sleeves from dry cleaning and
                                 newspapers everything needs to be clean and
                                 dry

each year our goal is to improve our recycling practices



we also make every effort to reduce our resource usage in one case by working with our supplier we

15gallon container of ultraconcentrated core cleaning and sanitation chemicals

other ways weve saved
here are some other gains weve made by conserving resources




we saved an impressive amount of paper by moving our reference materials to an electronic format for
our stores this switch enabled us to donate thousands of binders to local schools churches and other
nonprofit organizations




by working with our supplier we eliminated 13000 pounds of paper annually by reducing the amount of
paper in our bakery muffin cups by 23




we eliminated 7900 pounds of corrugated cardboard annually by working with our supplier to reduce the
size of the sidewalls on our italian wedding cake trays

acc the acc recognized us as a leader in recycling rigid plastic packaging by optimizing our backof

clean plastic for recycling and while were proud of the recognition were even prouder of the results

conserving every little drop
from our stores to our manufacturing plants
in order to boost our water conservation efforts
we have invested in installing smart irrigation
systems in some of our stores the program
began in 2014 with two pilot locations and we
have been working diligently to expand it ever
since so far the program has allowed us to
conserve more than 221 million gallons of water
because of the fantastic results weve seen we
have now successfully implemented these systems
in    16     stores   and   continue   to   explore more
locations



our irrigation specifications at our companycontrolled locations ensure that


           reclaimed or well water is used whenever possible
           rain and soil moisture sensors are installed with automatic control gauges to determine when landscaping need
           water
           irrigation systems are designed only after choosing plants and landscape design
           irrigation sprinklers dont overlap into single zones
           drip irrigation and microsprinklers are used where appropriate




     our dairy manufacturing teams modifications to four cleaning in place cip automatic wash systems
     also saves us 104 million gallons of water annually


     other water conservation efforts include installing lowflow faucets toilets and waterless urinals in
     our store bathrooms

keeping cooling efficient
our investments in improving refrigeration and air conditioning systems in our stores have reduced energy
usage saving us the following


29000 kwh saved annually per store by using highefficiency fan motors in back room freezers
up to 136000 kwh saved annually per store by putting doors on traditionally open refrigerated cases




we will continue to improve our efforts by testing more highefficiency fan motors and exploring more
environmentally friendly refrigerants




the environmental protection agencys epa greenchill program works to help food retailers lower
refrigerant charge sizes eliminate leaks transition to environmentally friendlier refrigerants and adopt
green refrigeration technologies and best environmental practices the partnership has three main
programs that help food retailers reduce their refrigerant emissions the food retailer corporate
emissions reduction program the store certification program for advanced refrigeration and the
advanced refrigeration promotion program as of august 2017 we have 35 stores that have achieved
silver greenchill certifications and two stores 1433 and 1520 that have received gold greenchill
certifications the goldcertified store distinction was earned thanks to our use of carbon dioxide as a
natural refrigerant



as the technology continues to mature we will continue to incorporate new methods to achieve our goal
of further reducing emissions of ozonedepleting refrigerants and increasing energy efficiency

  generated from our refrigeration systems

supporting our industry
our sustainable seafood policy embraces various categories of products including all products sold
from our fullservice cases and publix brand frozen items in our seafood department our policy reinforces
our stance in supporting the industry as it makes progress in its sustainability efforts




progress through partnerships
publix   is   the   first   us   retailer   to   team   up   with   sustainable   fisheries   partnership   sfp   on
the ocean disclosure project odp we know that transparency is important to our customers and the
odp is a great way for us to share information about the sources of the fisheries that supply our seafood
products



we also review the guidance provided by our partners at sfp regarding the products that we sell we start
by combining partner assessments of the fisheries with our own data to identify the species in most need
of fishery improvement project fip activity or sourcing changes we then involve our suppliers in the fip
or direct them to source from a more acceptable fishery they are expected to be proactive and work
independently of our direction while adhering to all laws and regulations

be involved in the solution
our suppliers understand our sustainability program because it is very simple be involved in the solution
as such we have donated 200000 to sfp toward fishery improvement project funding over the past
seven years



if we identify that an fip or aquaculture improvement project aip is needed we require the supplier to
participate or find a more sustainable source for that particular product an example of involvement in the
solution is the development of the zonal aquaculture standard which includes addressing ecosystem
impacts beyond individual farms to the existing certification programs during the development of this
standard we required all of our asian shrimp suppliers to attend a seminar presented by sfp and
encouraged them to participate in the growth of this program



we believe that our goals and processes will drive true and lasting change the only way that sustainability
will truly come to life in the seafood industry is for the industry to embrace it the industry environmental
groups and retailers must work together to meet sustainability goals

first in the us



publix is the first us retailer to team up with sustainable fisheries partnership sfp on the
ocean disclosure project odp we know that transparency is important to our customers and the odp is
a great way for us to share information about the sources of the fisheries that supply our seafood product




we ask our suppliers to provide information including the geographical location of the catch the scientific
name of the fish the type of fishing gear used thirdparty certifications and more sfp takes that
information and conducts further analysis using their fish source database to assess how the fishery is
managed health of the fish stocks and environmental impacts of the fishery

making progress with our seafood partners
leading the way in seafood sustainability starts with working together with partners who share our
passion our program stands out by supporting the seafood industry as it progresses in the meantime we
will do our part to ensure that we maintain sound sustainable practices



our program is divided into three parts



1 research and data collection
each year we conduct research and collect data for the top 85 of products sold in our seafood
department



2 product evaluation decisions and improvement projects
in conjunction with sustainable fisheries partnerships we annually evaluate our sources of supply and
determine which of the sources need improvement we then prioritize the projects we will work on the
following year this process helps us decide whether to sell a product enhance fisheries through
improvement projects or halt the sale of a product until the issue is resolved



3 measure progress
throughout our improvement projects we track our progress to ensure we are meeting milestones
annually to guarantee that we are achieving our goal for a more sustainable seafood supply

support or by actively purchasing from companies with similar ideals

                             philosophy is ingrained in our mission statement which calls us to
                             be involved as responsible citizens in our communities our goal is
                             to offer our customers more sustainable seafood options every

                      pound bags in 2015 we installed a wheat silo and
                      began to buy the flour in bulk this allowed us to
                      save 13000 pounds of paper bags that would
                      have otherwise gone into landfills because they
                      were not recyclable
