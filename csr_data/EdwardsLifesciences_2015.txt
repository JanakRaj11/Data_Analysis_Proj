transforming patient care through innovative technology
our spirit of innovation remains central to edwards today we are driven by a passion to help patients partnering with clinicians to
develop innovative technologies in the areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring we put patients first working
to produce better products that enable better outcomes for patients

                                    beginning more than 50 years ago when our founder miles lowell edwards partnered with dr albert starr to pioneer the development
                                    of the first replacement heart valve edwards has led the fields of tissue replacement heart valves and repair products and advanced
                                    hemodynamic monitoring which have helped treat and manage millions of patients worldwide

                                    but more than our history it is the notion of the future that defines us it is the question of whats possible in medicine tomorrow that
                                    drives us

                                    within the fields of critical care technology and heart valve therapies we see substantial patient needs and weve been immersed in these
                                    specialties long enough to know whats possible now and to envision what could be someday this concentration has enabled us to develop
                                    unmatched expertise in these fields and thereby innovate at a faster and more successful rate than those with a wider focus with each
                                    innovation our understanding of whats possible in critical care technology and heart valve therapies expands and we lay the groundwork
                                    for the next step forward

                                    at our core we believe there is enormous untapped possibility in medicine we believe that together we can change the way that medicine
                                    is practiced and therefore reduce the burden on patients at edwards we are proving that many advances we could never have imagined
miles lowell edwards and          before are possible
