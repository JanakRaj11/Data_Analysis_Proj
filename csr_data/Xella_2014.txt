principle of fundamental importance to our product
development process is that the products should be

strategy and management


success through
transparency


the quality of processes and products together with their documentation
are core components of a successful company in addition to quality
assurance industrial environmental protection occupational safety
and energy efficiency are further components of modern corporate
management however the cost of running separate management
systems in parallel is huge by harnessing synergies and bundling
resources lean and efficient management can be achieved by employ
ing an integrated management system


at the beginning of 2013 we introduced an integrated management
system fims at fels under the motto one house one system
previously the environmental energy and quality management systems
together with management systems for feed stuffs gmp potable water
haccp and a register of hazardous substances had existed side by
side fims now offers an integrated system that bundles all of the
management tasks and provides a framework for the management of
key documents with fims we want to simplify how we work with
the systems and render the documentation more transparent says
hanspeter thomas manager responsible for the project during the
course of a project that lasted several months the existing systems
were unified and consolidated into a 154page management manual
furthermore a central instruction level was created for the factories
and responsibility for management assigned via the manual process
and job descriptions

the eternal cycle



humans leave behind a huge amount of waste that nature is unable to
recycle the raw materials that exist within this waste can therefore
only be used once in other words they are only conceived for linear
material flows  from cradle to grave this means that a large
amount of valuable and finite resources ends up in waste incineration
plants and landfill sites  and is therefore irretrievably lost


over the long term we will be forced to bring our actions into line with the
lifecycle principle of the natural environment around us the solution is
innovative and intelligent product design in which all of the materials
used circulate within technical and biological cycles in other words
we must think in advance about what is going to happen in the future we
must think in terms of permanent product cycles  from cradle to cradle


it is in xellas commercial and ecological interests to recycle as many of
the raw materials used in production as possible for this reason our
sustainability council has decided that all of the products manufactured
by our brands ytong silka multipor and fermacell should conform to the
requirements of the lifecycle principle this means that these products must
reenter the raw material cycle so that they can be used in the manufac
ture of other products for example all of the production waste from our
autoclaved aerated concrete and calcium silicate block factories can be
reused with this system they may either be used as a basic material
in the mixing process or ground into granulate and then processed into
other products see page 56

ytong



ytong is one of the worlds oldest and best known building material
brands and is synonymous with autoclaved aerated concrete ytong
building blocks have been manufactured industrially for over 85 years
throughout the decades we have continually improved their quality
and characteristics today ytong stands for highly efficient thermal
insulation optimum fire protection excellent loadbearing abilities
and easy recycling


aerated autoclaved concrete is primarily composed of the mineral
natural materials lime sand cement and water manufacturing the
block requires low consumption of primary energy and its efficient
resource balance is equally impressive one cubic meter of raw material
is sufficient to produce five cubic meters of autoclaved aerated concrete
from production of the raw materials through manufacture and use
right up to material recycling following the demolition of buildings 
it is possible to achieve a closed raw material loop for ytong blocks
the environmental product declaration on the basis of the international
iso 14025 standard confirms that the block is free of harmful substances
does not release any emissions that are harmful to health and exhibits
an excellent eco balance

   despite its low weight ytong autoclaved aerated concrete
   exhibits high strength with a corresponding load bearing
   capacity the millions of air entrainments within the
   block give it one of the best thermal insulation values
   for solid building materials this allows energysaving
   exterior walls to be built without additional thermal
   insulation the ytong building block ensures an optimum
   relationship between temperature and air humidity
   thanks to its purely mineral structure autoclaved
   aerated concrete is guaranteed to be nonflammable
   completely free of harmful substances and therefore

also ensure a pleasant indoor climate a high proportion of macropores
in the gypsums core allows the boards to absorb excess humidity from
the air and release it again later when the indoor air is dry  making a
significant contribution to environmentally aware and healthy living
the independent ecoinstitut has also confirmed the environmental
sustainability of fermacell products

compounds the secondlargest german lime producer fels operates
seven lime plants a dolomite quarry and a mortar factory in germany
the company also operates a lime plant in vitosov czech republic and in
tovarkovo russia fels quarries limestone of high purity quality and
homogeneity from its own raw material deposits which is then refined
into highquality lime lime hydrate limestone and lime compounds


we supply some five million tons of our lime products to customers from
a range of industries these include the steel industry environmental pro
tection and railroad sectors lime and limestone products are also used
in the chemicals civil engineering agricultural and forestry sectors  and
in further important industrial applications


environmental protection is one of the largest areas of application for lime
from fels power stations waste incineration plants and other industrial
plants are supplied with over one million tons of high quality limestone pro
ducts for air pollution control each year lime is also indispensable for
wastewater treatment and potable water production the lakes left behind
by openface mining operations in the former coal producing areas of east
germany are undergoing longterm restoration using lime in civil engineer
ing lime is an important component used in soil reinforcement stabilization
and strengthening measures to make roads more resistant to water and
frost damage  and therefore more durable residual products from the
refining of crude oil are also treated with lime for instance scavenging
sludge from boreholes special lime products are also used to neutralize
acids bind heavy metals and support the degradation of pollutants


fels is also a key raw material supplier for the manufacture of autoclaved
aerated concrete and calcium silicate blocks as a natural raw material lime
makes a decisive contribution to the durability and sustainability of build
ing materials thanks to its excellent binding capacity and basicity it is
also effectively used in a wide range of environmental applications

ecoloop

ecoloop is xellas brand name for the generation of gas from waste
material the patented ecoloop process allows the ecologically and
economically beneficial conversion of residual materials into pure
synthetic gas syngas this syngas can be used in industrial processes
as a substitute for fossil fuels such as natural gas


the use of ecoloop therefore protects natural resources and even gener
ates a triple value contribution energy savings are achieved through
the significantly lower production cost of the syngas compared with
fossil fuels disposal costs are reduced because ecoloop represents the
most costefficient reprocessing option and for specific applications
additional income is obtained through the recovery of valuable materials
such as metals and phosphor


examples of useful residual waste products include plastics containing
chlorine that have received little processing fractions of household waste
or residual products from automobile recycling however sewage
sludge and sulfurous fossil fuels that cannot be used in conventional
combustion processes can also be utilized ecoloop can therefore efficiently
reprocess residuals that have no better or more ecological use


in addition to conserving fossil fuels and solving recycling problems
the ecoloop process has further positive effects on sustainability  in
particular when compared to traditional means of disposal using thermal
treatment ecoloop binds the chlorine found in residual waste to the lime
and functions as a chlorine sink furthermore as a result of binding
with lime the formation of dioxins and furans is prevented making flue
gas scrubbing unnecessary the whole process is also a closedloop
system with no environmentally damaging emissions or negative effects
on the ground and water finally ecoloop achieves a higher thermal
efficiency compared with other processes which means that a given
amount of energy can be generated from a lower volume of residual
waste  with a consequent reduction in co2 emissions the degree to
which the ecoloop process is environmentally friendly is highlighted by
the awards it has received the german innovation prize for climate
and the environment iku and the hugo junkers innovation prize the
ecoloop plant is located at the fels kaltes tal site and is currently still
at the trial stage

clean transportation on
the worlds oceans



with over 40 billion tonkilometers of cargo maritime shipping is the
most important mode of transport for the global economy and a key
accelerator of globalization almost all of the ships that sail the seven
seas are powered by diesel engines but in addition to co2 these emit
huge volumes of aggressive sulfur dioxide in particular this gas is
equally responsible for the formation of acid rain and the acidification
of sea water as it is for causing chronic respiratory diseases there is
however an effective method of flue gas desulfurization  using hydrated
lime from fels the idea has received the xella innovation award


the heavy fuel oil used by deep sea shipping is a byproduct of the
petrochemicals industry according to the federal ministry of transport
and digital infrastructure bmvi this oil has an average sulfur content
of 27 percent its toxicity would therefore be some three thousand times
greater than that of automotive fuels the 55000 merchant ships that
consume 370 million tons of heavy fuel oil each year emit some 20 million
tons of sulfur dioxide sox globally this is about the same as 400 large
scale coalfired power stations


in order to tackle the problems associated with this the international
maritime organization imo has decided to progressively reduce the
sulfur content of marine fuels the current threshold value in the
emission control areas ecas  which include the north sea and
baltic sea  is one percent but from 2015 this will be reduced to just
01 percent the current threshold value for global shipping is 35 per
cent but from 2020 a maximum of 05 percent will be permitted

recycling with quality



                 gypsum fiberboard residues generated on construction
               sites can be reintegrated into the production process
for this purpose a recycling plant was built in just nine months  during
ongoing production  at the fermacell factory in the dutch town of
wijchen this plant reprocesses residual gypsum waste from construc
tion sites or demolished buildings so that it can be reintegrated into the
production cycle


gypsum is nearly one hundred percent recyclable without any loss in
quality the approximately 15000 tons of gypsum recycled at wijchen
already equates to 15 percent of our processed raw materials the plan
is to increase this to at least 20 percent all parties involved profit
from gypsum recycling construction companies have less waste to
dispose of while fermacell pays 30 percent less for the raw material
and also saves transportation costs for fresh gypsum


despite an investment of over one million euro the recycling plant will
probably take just 18 months to amortize fermacell primarily uses
fdg gypsum obtained from flue gas desulfurization plants at power
stations which is of above average purity fdg gypsum can be mixed
with recycled gypsum and paper fibers from recycled paper before
being processed into fermacell gypsum fiberboard panels it is likely
that we will now only need to purchase a small volume of additional
gypsum this year thanks to the new plant in wijchen

                                the closedloop system in focus


   according to the german federal office of statistics
   of the some 386 million total tons of waste that accrued
   in germany during 2011 construction and demolition
   waste accounted for almost 200 million tons this can
   be classified into the material groups mineral const
   ruction waste road construction waste and building
   site waste these include aerated concrete and gypsum
   based construction waste a large proportion of these
   waste materials can be reused as aggregates in re
   cycled building materials eg for road building in the
   manufacture of asphalt and concrete or in landfill site
   construction however some building site waste still
   remains to be disposed of


   with this inconceivable volume of waste it quickly
   becomes clear that in terms of a resourceconserving
   approach the issue of recycling is particularly signifi
   cant to the building materials industry we are not so
   much concerned here with socalled downcycling  in
   which the treated rubble is reused for a different pur
   pose eg road building  but with recycling the waste
   as autoclaved aerated concrete xella has decided to
   set itself the objective of closing the material loop for
   autoclaved aerated concrete


   70 percent recycling from 2020
   this is our response to the european waste framework
   directive pursuant to which at least 70 percent of all
   construction and demolition waste must be recycled
   after 2020 it must furthermore be expected that build
   ing material manufacturers will be faced with a take
   back obligation for building materials once this directive
   enters into effect the challenge is huge in order to be
   able to reuse or recycle building materials they must
   first meet the corresponding requirements relating to
   their grade of purity in particular they may not contain

   sludge break down the carbon this forms carbonic
   acid which is neutralized with around 40 grams of lime

   contain carbon plastics biological waste etc in this
   innovative process aggressive substances such as the
   hydrogen chlorides released from plastic waste during

qualified and motivated managerial staff and employees are the most
important basis that will ensure sustained success for the xella group
this is why we motivate and support our workers by offering them
opportunities and benefits aimed particularly at their professional
development recognizing and developing our employees capabilities
is just as important to us as retaining our staff over the long term


the human resources management hrm department at xella is
tasked with creating organizational and human resource structures
that will allow our employees to fulfil their professional and personal
potential to the full and ensure that their skills and aptitudes are
correspondingly utilized but we cant only rely on the existing work
force to secure the companys sustained success it is also important
to achieve the right individual balance between employees that have
gained many years of experience with the company and bringing in
new talent this means on the one hand that we must permanently
recruit suitable workers from the job market while on the other we
must ensure that our existing employees develop their skills to the
best of their abilities a further key issue lies in maintaining the
attractiveness of our company with the primary aim of retaining
employees that have xellaspecific knowledge over the long term

fairness is our duty



over recent years the requirements for sustainable and ethically
correct corporate management have become significantly tighter
correspondingly compliant conduct is increasingly demanded
by stakeholders in particular business partners large corpo
rations have recently undertaken major efforts to prevent non
compliant conduct especially in the area of corruption however
compliance is about more than simply preventing corruption its
also about compliance with the law in general fairness non
discrimination and the strict separation of business and private
interests


in order to ensure both proper conduct and the fulfilment of stakehol
der expectations it is necessary for the company to have an organiza
tional structure in 2011 xella commenced a comprehensive review of
its existing code of conduct even if much of the content is not new 
and also applies without the need for a code of conduct  a detailed
presentation of the rules of conduct gives employees greater confi
dence in their actions and helps both them and the company to avoid
incurring potential penalties
