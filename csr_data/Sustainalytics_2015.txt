conflicts of interest
sustainalytics avoids entering into commercial relationships that might jeopardize the
companys integrity and research independence

in 2014 sustainalytics began updating its code of conduct this was necessary in part to
ensure that regional codes were aligned and that a variety of policies and procedures were
aggregated sustainalytics revised code was approved in q2 2015 sustainalytics continues
to focus on ensuring its implementation including adherence to the process to be followed
if an employee believes a specific client relationship or prospective relationship presents
a potential conflict

sustainalytics decisions with respect to managing the company how we do things
as highlighted previously we firmly believe that it is critical to integrate sustainability
parameters into our management decisionmaking and reporting because it improves our
understanding of our business in addition to being the right thing to do
                                                                                                              2012                               2013                                 2014

human capital
at sustainalytics employees are our most important asset we believe that our ability to
attract talented staff and motivate and support them through a career path in the hope of
retaining them for the longterm is an important competitive advantage this is becoming
increasingly important as a mainstreaming market requires esg providers that can provide
high quality research insightful analysis and meaningful support and client service these
are the primary reasons that sustainalytics has chosen to build its own team globally as                     employees in romania and france 38 are represented by collective bargaining
opposed to producing research through a network of partnerships or leveraging outsourcing                     agreements
firms both of which can lead to suboptimal results based on our experience                                 managing our human capital efficiently is a critical ingredient in the longterm success
in 2014 our employee base grew by 33 we ended the year with 200 employees among                           of sustainalytics given that labour costs represent on average approximately 78 of our
them 88 44 men and 112 56 women the vast majority of our staff were permanent                         annual cost base on that front 2014 was a good year as sustainalytics managed personnel
fulltime employees with the exception of one 05 contractor 10 5 employees on fixed                  expenditures within 1 of our target
term contracts and 18 9 employees working less than fulltime                                            another key measure of sustainalytics success is employee turnover which has averaged under

sustainable procurement
the environmental and social impacts of sustainalytics supply chain are not considered to
be significant nevertheless we make efforts to source responsibly and established a formal
sustainable procurement policy in 2014 the policy applies at a minimum to office supplies
and services and food and drink associated with staff functions at all of our offices globally
our objective is to extend this policy to cover 100 of company purchases operations
staff who are responsible for purchasing received training focused on how to recognise
and source sustainable products in their regions

                                in addition to continuing to measure the key indicators highlighted in this report in 2015
                                sustainalytics will focus on embedding sustainability metrics more effectively into our
                                strategic decisionmaking and management reporting systems this will include efforts
                                to improve our data collection systems as well sustainalytics will continue to build on its
                                commitment not only to measure and manage these issues but to report more effectively
                                to our stakeholders

                                one of the greatest challenges sustainalytics faces in the coming years is to measure and
                                more meaningfully understand the impact our work directly and through our clients has on
                                the economy environment and society we will strive to make progress in this area in 2015
