annual review 2013                           alma media corporation

an interview with the president and ceo
president and ceo kai telanne how would you describe alma
medias year 2013
the past year was characterised by two very different forces first of all the weak development in the economy at large
had a negative impact on the financial success of the media industry the structural change concerning media
consumption and advertising accelerated as did the transition from traditional media to digital channels in 2013
investments in advertising in finland declined by 85 per cent in comparison to the year before in addition the
circulation and singleissue sales of print magazines and newspapers continued to decline because of this media
companies  alma media included  had to increase the speed of their adjustment measures and organisational
restructuring

on the other hand we also had many things to be happy about at alma media our digital media development projects
were successful both in our publishing business as well as in our services business the profitability of our international
investments also developed favourably and our efforts to integrate the digital businesses weve acquired into alma
media were successful both at home and abroad our new printing facility at tampere also began operations and our
expectations with regard to its competitiveness are high



what has been alma medias response to the uncertainties in the
business environment
as the digitalisation of media increases and consumer behaviour becomes more fragmented we have developed our
publishing operations towards multimediality what this means in practice is that all of our key contents and services
will soon be available online and in mobile environments alma media is furthermore actively developing tools that
facilitate the purchasing of digital advertising for the purposes of targeted online advertising and the traffic
measurements and analytics of online and mobile services for example alma medias network advertising which
reaches nearly five million consumers a week has indeed been growing strongly

in terms of the print media we have adjusted our operations and renewed our ways of working and thereby improved
productivity while volumes have declined the new regional media operating model implemented through the
organisational restructuring of our publishing business for example has resulted in significant cost savings the
consolidation of editorial cooperation aimed at improving consumer services is still under way

in addition to this we have decentralised our business beyond the borders of finland to the emerging markets in
central eastern europe and thereby reduced our dependence on the weakly developing domestic market



how well did alma media do in terms of achieving its financial
targets for 2013
the changes and weak business conditions affecting our industry also had an impact on alma medias financial
development we lagged behind the budgeted revenue development our revenue declined by 65 per cent in 2013
totalling approximately eur 300 million we also missed our performance targets operating profit excluding non
recurring items  eur 242 million  declined by 278 per cent from the year before mainly due to the decline in print
media revenue alma medias result was boosted by the corporate acquisitions and streamlining efforts implemented in
2012 but despite the cost adjustments we were not able to fully compensate for the sharp decline in revenue

on the other hand we can be very satisfied with the strong growth of our digital business the focus of our growth
strategy and development digital products and services accounted for 281 per cent of the groups total revenue in
2013 kauppalehtis digital content revenue for instance grew by 221 per cent in comparison to the year before our
digital recruitment services which accounted for 109 per cent of alma medias revenue in 2013 also continued to
perform well




annual review 2013                                           1                                   alma media corporation

what do you think were alma medias most important
development measures in 2013
i am very happy with the development of our international digital investments we invested in a number of digital
recruitment services in the czech republic and slovakia in 2012 and these services were successfully integrated with
alma media in 2013 in addition we made an important decision on the expansion of our cooperation with monster
worldwide which operates on a global scale

regarding multichannel publishing operations i would like to mention the launch of the paid digital content
implemented in the context of kauppalehti the lessons learned have been put to use when developing paid content in
alma regional media we have also managed to develop various mobile services very quickly the number of visitors to
iltalehtis mobile site has grown fivefold in the course of a year the positive experiences gathered from iltv have also
increased our belief in the potential of the online tv business and its development



how has the organisations competence developed in the midst of
the digital transition
our digital knowhow has improved alongside the increase in international digital operations and new market areas
for example  particularly in terms of recruitment and career services we have increased our experience of paid digital
content the management of consumer interfaces the application of new technology and the building and utilisation of
multichannel platforms the mobile business in particular as well as the building of related content and the
production sales and marketing of digital video have been at the heart of our development work we have also made
significant progress in the use of behavioral data and the productisation of targeted advertising and marketing



alma media invested eur 70 million in a new printing facility that
was completed in the spring of 2013 at which stage will the new
printing facility begin to produce additional financial value
the initial stages were difficult due to technical problems we nevertheless managed to secure production during the
third quarter the new printing facility was able to provide productionrelated benefits to the groups internal printing
jobs as early as late 2013 and external sales of its capacity have also fared well we are expecting good performance
development on this front during the current year all in all the commissioning of the new printing facility has
represented a significant step in securing the future business of our print media



alma media has recently made a number of investments in the
recruitment sector in eastern central europe how has the
profitability of these investments developed
alma medias successful acquisitions in recruitment and career services in recent years have made it the market leader
not only in finland but also in the baltic countries and several countries in eastern central europe our investments in
eastern central europe have been very successful despite the weak economic situation we have managed to increase
our business and improve our profitability both in the czech republic and slovakia the new services have also given a
boost to the sharing of international knowhow and the development of various valueadded services related to
recruitment

the latest strategic step consisted of including monsters services in poland hungary and the czech republic in alma
medias recruitment service offering in the beginning of 2014 in the future we will therefore also be able to take
advantage of monsters technologies service concepts and sales network in selected market areas we believe these will
bring plenty of added value to alma medias existing recruitment service offering




annual review 2013                                           2                                   alma media corporation

what are alma medias future sources of growth
we will continue our strategy of increasing the multichannel aspects of our publishing business and our digital
business our goal is to increase the share of digital revenue from the current 28 per cent to 50 per cent by 2020 in
practice this requires us to build new and varied digital services alongside traditional publishing operations

we will also continue to invest in various digital market place businesses and increase our digital consumer services
business of which we have good experiences in terms of services such as telkkucom kotikokkinet and ekontakti

in addition we will seek growth from digital services aimed at businesses alma media is the finnish market leader in
the provision of financial and company information we will continue to reinforce the digital media and service offering
in this area

we also plan to increase our online tv business we will increase our digital video services in both desktop and mobile
user interfaces online tv provides consumers with freedom of choice digital video can be watched anywhere and at
anytime the online tv business may be more profitable for a media company than traditional broadcasting operations
even small audiences are sufficient since production is inexpensive



which issues in 2013 were important in terms of corporate
responsibility
one of the most important focal points of alma medias sustainable media programme in 2013 was analysing the
medias brainprint or the impacts media content has on society alma media was involved in the international
discussion on brainprint and also introduced the concept in finland moreover we raised the idea of constructive
journalism into societal discussion

i am happy that our longterm environmental work also gained recognition we were the only media company to rise to
the climate disclosure leadership index of the best nordic companies in the context of the climate initiative of carbon
disclosure project in addition to environmental responsibility our new printing facility and business premises
furthered the wellbeing of our employees in the form of an improved working environment

we will continue our work in relation to the brainprint of media content this year we also intend to pay increasing
attention to the globally topical subject of data protection and the development of related practices



what does the future of the media market look like in finland
what does it look like in the rest of the world
the development of the media market is closely linked to general economic trends when the general economy
improves the media market will follow this is now taking place elsewhere in the world but in the case of finland it
seems that the pick up in the economy will be delayed finlands structural problems are slowing down the emerging
growth which is why the growth outlooks for the coming years are not necessarily similar to those in the rest of the
world

the volume of advertising in finland right now is weak even in proportion to the gdp the low advertising volume of
products and services plays a role in fueling the negative cycle in trade media companies and the entire society tax
increases and the unreasonable distribution price increases of itella have a further negative impact on the operating
conditions of the commercial print media alma media must be able to operate profitably and find the means for
growth in a weakly developing market as well

the industry is going through a difficult period of transition but i do see a brighter future thanks to our active digital
development and increased operational efficiency our situation will be a lot better than it was before once the economy
recovers our strength lies in our competent and professional employees and in our successful brands the work of
media is never over it merely changes its form

i would like to take this opportunity to thank our customers employees and investors for the past year due to our
smooth cooperation alma media holds all the cards for taking the company to a new level  this is a good point from
which to forge ahead

operating environment
for media companies 2013 was a year of renewal and efficiency improvements print advertising
decreased as the shift to digital channels in media consumption became stronger the need to develop
businesses based on new and diversified media was highlighted
the first signs of recovery were seen in the international economy in 2013 but the economic situation remained weak
particularly in the eurozone the finnish economy took a turn to modest growth in the second quarter nevertheless
gdp growth for the full year was negative 14 per cent consumer confidence in the economy also remained well
below the longterm average confederation of finnish industries

economic growth was also slow in the eastern central european countries that constitute alma medias fastestgrowing
markets in 2013 the gdp of the czech republic declined by 10 per cent in slovakia gdp increased by 09 per cent
eurostat forecast january 2014



media advertising volume continued to decline
according to tns media intelligence media advertising volume which is closely linked to gdp growth decreased in
finland in 2013 by 85 per cent compared to the previous year totalling meur 12062 the share of advertising of gdp
in finland was also low by international comparison clearly below the levels seen in countries such as the united
states and the uk




in 2013 print media represented 495 per cent of all media advertising the decline in advertising volume from the
previous year was the most substantial in newspaper advertising which fell by 158 per cent the contributing factors
included a very low volume of recruitment advertising 281 per cent yearonyear due to the uncertain economic
situation alma media estimates that its market share is approximately 20 per cent of all newspaper advertising in
finland

new printing facility
the new printing facility of alma medias printing and distribution arm alma manu was commissioned in spring 2013
the printing facility will improve the competitiveness of printing operations well into the future the new printing press
is more efficient than its predecessor which enables the printing of not only the groups own newspapers but other
papers as well during the critical night time period the additional capacity also improves the printing facilitys
profitability as the new equipment allows the printing of products faster and with less waste than before customers can
also be offered an even broader range of products and variations thanks to the comprehensive selection of printing and
mailing solutions available

the initial stages of the commissioning of the new printing press were challenging due to production and distribution
issues however control over the printing facilitys production reliability improved in the third quarter and late
deliveries decreased compared to earlier in the year the new printing facility is expected to produce a positive financial
result in 2014

alma manu also signed a contract with its first new customers in september it was confirmed that the printing of
hämeen sanomat and hämeenlinnan kaupunkiuutiset will be moved to the printing facility in tampere from 1
january 2014 onwards

the efficiency of printing operations was also improved by other arrangements made in 2013 the company decided to
close down printing operations in rovaniemi by the end of march 2014 an agreement was signed to print the groups
newspapers in northern finland at the kaleva printing facility in oulu thereafter the new printing location ensures the
newspapers printing quality and their continued early morning delivery as a result of the shutdown decision alma
media recorded a nonrecurring expense of meur 35 for the second quarter of the year consisting of impairment loss
on fixed assets and other reorganisation costs

sustainable media
changes in media consumption and consumer behaviour create a need for renewal in the media
sector part of alma medias response to these challenges is its sustainable media programme which
cultivates journalistic values while integrating corporate responsibility in all operations
over the past few years alma media has made considerable efforts to develop its sustainable media programme both
in its own operations and by introducing the theme in public discussion alma medias activity in this field places the
group in a strong position as a forerunner in corporate responsibility in the nordic media industry



goals and achievements in 2013
in 2013 the focal points of corporate responsibility were the societal impacts of journalism and advertising alma
media also continued its own activities and cooperation to mitigate the environmental impacts of the media sector and
reduce youth unemployment

a media companys most significant impact is created through the content it produces each of alma medias media
outlets has a responsibility for its journalistic content alma medias task is to promote discussion on the responsibility
associated with freedom of speech and to increase awareness of the brainprint media leaves on audiences and society
in 2013 alma media was actively involved in research and discussion on brainprint both in finland and
internationally in addition to the impacts of journalism the discussion extended to the impacts of advertising and how
advertising can promote not only consumption but also sustainable development

a second focal area was work related to the environmental impacts of media and continued partnerships in this field
alma media became the first and only nordic media company to be listed on the cdli climate index the index is
comprised of 27 nordic listed companies recognised for having the highest level of transparency with respect to climate
issues the environmental study published by alma media in 2012 on the impacts of print and digital media continued
to attract a great deal of interest and the study was used for various purposes including the assessment of the
environmental impacts of advertising in recognition of its environmental efforts alma media received leed
environmental certification in 2013 for its new head office in töölönlahti and its printing facility in tampere

preventing youth employment was the third focal area in 2013 for the third consecutive year alma media and its
online service monsterfi were involved as main partners in supporting and implementing the finnish children and
youth foundations responsible summer job project the 2013 campaign attracted 174 responsible employers who
offered a total of more than 35000 summer and seasonal jobs

the sustainable media programme is implemented in alma medias and its employees way of working and through the
choices employees make on a daily basis alma medias corporate responsibility objectives are thus implemented by
every employee and business unit in their daily operations and the communication of specific corporate responsibility
goals is not always possible or even meaningful nevertheless alma media has set certain specific corporate
responsibility objectives to support responsible actions in daily work in addition to the objectives described below
goals related to corporate responsibility are also described in the sections on the environment and employees

impact on employee wellbeing the töölönlahti office building which brings helsinkibased alma media employees
together under one roof was a particularly important factor in facilitating collaboration the sharing of expertise and
networking between units in a new way new cooperation networks established in 2013 included the young alma
medians network for the young and young at heart and a software developers network as part of alma medias
corporate responsibility initiatives three workshops open to all employees were organised to provide employees with

printing and distribution unit alma manu as in previous years the units response rate was low under 40 per cent
due to delivery employees being more difficult to reach with an online survey than other employees

reflected in a more spirited attitude towards resolving problems as well as improvements in giving feedback and
rewards in addition to managerial work the survey respondents commended on the companys development of
operating methods and increased flexibility the responses from alma media employees based in helsinki also
highlighted the improvements in the working environment brought about by the new office premises

perceived as uncertain this was also reflected in ambiguity regarding common targets and objectives based on the
results of the employee survey improving the digital competence of alma media employees was identified as a focal
area for development across the organisation

brainprint
one of the most important focal points of alma medias sustainable media programme in 2013 was understanding and
analysing medias brainprint or the impacts media content has on society alma media was involved in the
international discussion on brainprint and also introduced the concept in finland

in 2013 alma media contributed to the mirrors or movers report on brainprint and also participated in the seminar in
which the report was presented the report identifies six ways media influences choices and the construction of our
reality through the content it publishes in addition to participating in the international discussion on the topic alma
media also organised an internal event on brainprint and the role of the journalist from a societal standpoint
brainprint will also be one of the main themes of the sustainable media programme in 2014 with plans to continue the
discussion on the topic at another mirrors or movers conference as well as other contexts


transparency and interactivity in media as cornerstones of responsibility
the basic values of journalism and their impact on society have become an increasingly prominent subject of
international public debate this is largely due to a number of muchpublicised cases in the united kingdom in which
the ethics and transparency of journalism failed to meet the standards for responsible journalism the public debate
has strengthened alma medias newspapers and websites commitment to open and transparent journalism based on
active industry selfregulation as well as media outlets own ethical principles that involve stricter standards than the
guidelines for journalists issued by the finnish union of journalists

openness is the foundation of responsible journalism corporate responsibility reporting by media companies is one
component of open journalism in spring 2012 the global reporting initiative gri published a media sector
supplement as guidance for the media industry alma media was actively involved in the creation of the guidelines by
for example commenting on them in 2013 alma media became the first finnish media company to publish a
corporate responsibility report in compliance with the gri media sector supplement guidelines

alma regional media has implemented extensive changes to its organisational structure and operating model in recent
years the most recent of these changes is the renewal of aamulehti the plans which include an extensive renewal of
content as well as a shift to the tabloid format were completed in 2013 one of the key objectives of the renewal process
was to ensure the conditions for sustainable open and local journalism in the future as transformational changes in
lifestyles and media create an entirely new operating environment where the focus is on diverse content and sharing
content across multiple channels

promoting and supporting freedom of speech is another key responsibility of alma medias newspapers on world press
freedom day on 3 may 2013 alma media and alma regional media together organised the long live freedom of
speech campaign on social media with the aim of helping the finnish audience understand the value of freedom of
speech and to exercise this freedom responsibly  without forgetting the fun side of freedom of speech the campaign
reached nearly 7500 online users interested in freedom of speech

environment
in 2013 alma media took significant steps forward in environmental responsibility with the completion of its new
helsinki office and the printing facility in tampere both buildings were awarded leed environmental certification
upon completion another important activity in the area of environmental responsibility alma medias environmental
study on the environmental impacts of print and online media was completed in 2013 alma media also received
international recognition for its climate work in 2013 the company was ranked as the best nordic media company in
the carbon disclosure project cdp a global initiative on climate impacts with a score that improved compared to the
previous year this improvement saw alma media achieve a position in the climate disclosure leadership index which
is comprised of the top 27 nordic listed companies in the area of climate work




annual review 2013                                                               44                                       alma media corporation

environmental responsibility as a strong element in construction projects
the most significant environmental impacts of alma medias and its business units operations are related to printing
and distribution properties purchasing and travel alma medias new helsinki office in töölönlahti and the new
printing facility in tampere which began operations in spring 2013 reduce the groups direct enviromental impacts in
the operations in which they are the highest environmental impacts during construction as well as use were
minimised in both projects both of the buildings received leed environmental certification in 2013 the helsinki office
building achieved leed gold certification in recognition of environmental aspects having been taken into account at an
excellent level the tampere printing facility is the worlds first leed certified printing facility

environmental matters were taken into consideration in many ways in the design of the töölönlahti office building and
selecting its location including the following

   energyefficient building technology
   underground parking with charging stations for electric cars
   waste management during construction and use with extensive recycling
   excellent public transport links


material and energy efficiency
alma media develops its environmental responsibility by improving its material and energy efficiency information on
opportunities for potential improvement in efficiency was obtained through the environmental study carried out in
2012 the new printing facility and office building significantly improve the energy efficiency of alma medias
properties for instance the printing facility in tampere has a heat recovery system that captures over 80 per cent of
exhaust air the new printing press also has an improved production efficiency and it has resulted in lower use of
solvent based detergents and water

the new printing facility will lead to a substantial decrease in the amount of materials wasted however in the first year
of operations the maculature percentage of the new printing facility was not lower than that of its predecessor as test
runs and problems in the breakingin phase resulted in more wasted material than normal the objective for 2014 is to
establish comparable data for the maculature percentage in order to measure and develop the environmental efficiency
of the new printing facility

another key aspect of material efficiency is the recovery of waste almost all waste created by the printing facility is
used as a raw material by another business the efficiency of waste sorting improved further in 2013 with all waste
generated at the printing facility now recovered for recycling or reuse and no waste ending up at landfill sites

harmful voc emissions volatile organic compounds from printing operations were kept very low in 2013 the
chemicals used for cleaning the printing machine have been vocfree for some time and since 2012 the company has
also minimised the voc content of the dampening solution used in the printing process alma medias printing facility
in tampere was one of the first printing facilities internationally to begin using a dampening solution that is almost
entirely free of voc emissions

the maculature percentage expresses the proportion of waste material to total material used in printing operations


environmental aspects an increasingly important factor in ict purchases
alma media can also influence its environmental impact through its purchasing at present environmental
considerations are particularly taken into account in newsprint purchases as paper production has wideranging
impacts on climate change and resource depletion as well as biodiversity in 2013 75 per cent of the newsprint used by
alma media contained recycled fibre the share of recycled fibre in all newsprint pulp used by alma media was 38 per
cent environmental issues are also a key factor in purchasing chemicals and printing plates

the sustainable media programme includes the objective of integrating ecological considerations increasingly into ict
purchases the environmental study indicated that ict equipment and infrastructure have significant environmental
impacts careful analysis and mitigation of these impacts is of great importance as digital media consumption grows in
2013 alma media began to evaluate its ict supply chain in even greater detail than before from the perspectives of
environmental as well as social responsibility the supply chain was evaluated as far back as possible in collaboration
with the partners with whom alma media has the highest purchasing volume also ensuring that the partners have the
required certification the aim is to continue this work in 2014 to identify the most significant risks in the supply chain
and to begin corrective action as necessary

the average carbon dioxide emissions of the groups leased car fleet are also regularly monitored the target is to
reduce average emissions by 8 per cent from 2013 to 2016 in 2013 the average co2 emissions of the groups motor
vehicles were 141g of co2 equivalent per kilometre

increasing awareness through open communication on corporate responsibility
increasing awareness of environmental issues among stakeholders is one of alma medias most important ways of
influencing its environmental impacts in 2013 environmental themes were communicated internally on the
sustainable media tour in tampere as well as through customised training and coaching for target groups including
media sales delivery personnel editorial offices and members of the groups corporate responsibility network

activities in 2013 also included the second ratkaisun paikka corporate responsibility event with alma media as the
main media partner alma medias role in the event was to provide greater exposure arrange presenters and deliver a
talk the aim of alma medias participation in the event was to promote corporate responsibility thinking in finland
this goal was reached as the event with some 700 visitors and highly positive feedback exceeded all expectations
alma media will again be the main media partner of the next ratkaisun paikka fair in may 2014

alma media is actively involved in industrywide environmental initiatives such as the shape study carried out by the
federation of the finnish media industry and vtt technical research centre which investigates media consumption
from the perspective of its environmental impacts on the international stage alma media took a prominent role in the
discussion of the environmental impacts of print and digital media with the research it has commissioned and engages
in active communications on

alma media also continued to actively communicate its environmental impacts to readers and users of services in
2013 sustainable media communications which include environmental fact adverts published by newspapers are
aimed at communicating the environmental impacts of media and giving readers information on what they can do to
reduce the environmental impacts of their own media consumption

in 2012 alma media became one of the first businesses to join the city of helsinki climate partners network aimed at
promoting cooperation to reduce climate emissions and boost the competitiveness of the participating companies alma
media also published its own climate covenant with specific climate targets in conjunction with joining the initiative
alma media continued its active partnership in 2013 by for example participating in the facilitation of a network
workshop and planning a climate partners network event of its own for january 2014

a glance at 2014

towards a multimedia approach to publishing operations growing the digital service business and
improving the efficiency of operating models alma media will continue to implement this strategy in
2014 while accelerating the growth of digital business

market outlook

economy after a period of recession this is due to a number of structural factors that slow down economic growth on
the other hand the economic cycle appears to be reaching a turning point in the eurozone and the swedish and
norwegian economies are showing positive development

from the perspective of commercial media the outlook for the finnish economy is cause for only cautious optimism if
the economy does turn around and begin the predicted slow growth it can be assumed that the decline in advertising
investments will stop and turn to moderate growth

proliferation of smartphones and tablet devices the demand for media consumption is strongly directed towards digital
and mobile media in particular
