building construction finland and russian operations the former scandinavia business segment was integrated into the
infrastructure construction business segment russian operations include both building construction and infrastructure
construction businesses

at the beginning of 2015 the infrastructure construction business segment was divided into two paving mineral aggregates
and earthworks businesses were transferred to the new paving business segment foundation engineering civil engineering and
rock engineering constitute the new infra projects business segment as of 1 january 2015 the reporting business segments
are paving infra projects building construction finland and russian operations building construction in sweden is reported
as part of the groups other operations

infrastructure construction
operating environment
in finland infrastructure construction decreased due to weak development in building construction and cuts in road
maintenance appropriations in the state budget underground infrastructure construction remained brisk especially in urban
growth centres in sweden norway and denmark road construction including the renovation projects maintained the demand
for paving in particular in addition the governments of these countries are investing in the infrastructure network development
and in road maintenance in the baltic countries the market situation in infrastructure construction was mainly stable the mild
weather prolonged the paving season in all lemminkäinens operating countries

operating environment
the market situation in building construction remained weak in 2014 construction was supported by renovation which
remained stable only some 25000 28000 new residential units were started and the number is not expected to increase in
2015 housing sales slowed down especially during the second half of the year as consumer demand was decreased by
economic uncertainty and longer sales times of old private houses commercial construction was minimal particularly outside
the helsinki metropolitan area in 2015 the market situation in building construction is estimated to remain similar to 2014

due to the declining markets in 2014 the number of residential development startups targeted at consumers was slightly

russian operations
operating environment
the economic uncertainty in russia and the radical weakening of the rouble in 2014 increased mortgage interest rates and
banks applied stricter loan terms in many locations however the economic and political uncertainty did not decrease consumer
demand for housing in the socalled comfort class where a large proportion of housing transactions are financed by the
consumers themselves housing sales were brisk especially during the fourth quarter of the year in infrastructure construction
several statefunded road renovation projects were started especially on roads departing from moscow the outlook for 2015
continues to be uncertain the declining oil price is slowing down the countrys economic growth and together with the limited
scope of the russian financial markets is impairing the general construction market situation the increase in mortgage
interest rates and the decreasing purchasing power of the middle class may reduce the demand for housing this year

5 seasonality of business
seasonality of certain operations of the company affects the amount and timing of the companys profits paving and mineral
aggregates working season takes place mostly in the second and third quarters of a year to which quarters most of the revenues
are recognised weather conditions influence the lengths of the paving and mineral aggregates working seasons which also
affects the amount and timing of the companys profits other infrastructure projects eg rock engineering and earthworks are
generally less seasonal in nature but there is some seasonality in foundation engineering due to the timing of building
construction projects

revenue from own building developments is recognised for the sold proportion on completion which causes seasonal
fluctuations to the companys profit the company seeks to offset this fluctuation by launching new own developed housing
projects evenly throughout the year in which case the projects will be completed and revenue from them is recognised as evenly
as possible throughout the year

the company has recorded the deferred tax asset from tax losses to the amount it considers based on its profit forecasts to be
utilisable in the future the amount of tax losses has increased especially due to nonrecurring items which are not expected to
reoccur in the future in 2013 the amount of tax losses in finland was increased by the damages that the district court ordered
lemminkäinen to pay related to the asphalt cartel at the end of 2014 tax losses in the groups finnish companies totalled
eur 231 million eur 195 mill and they can be carried forward for 10 years the amount of tax losses in the groups
norwegian companies stood at eur 121 million eur 146 mill at the end of 2014 and they can be carried forward
indefinitely the amount of the companys tax losses from which deferred tax asset has not been recorded is not significant

no deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of the undistributed profits of foreign subsidiaries because the funds are
permanently invested in operations abroad

 the goodwill reported in the common to segment column has arisen from the asphalt business acquisitions in denmark and norway it is allocated to the
international operations baltic rim region paving and mineral aggregates cash generating unit this goodwill has been tested for impairment at the level of the
whole international operations baltic rim region paving and mineral aggregates cash generating unit in addition the goodwill allocated to each business area has
been tested separately for each country

goodwill impairment tests

goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there are indications of possible impairment the tests are carried out
as valueinuse calculations of individual businesses in accordance with the smallest cashgenerating unit principle in
impairment testing the discounted present value of the recoverable cash flows of each cashgenerating unit is compared with
the carrying amount of the unit in question if the present value is lower than the carrying amount the difference is recognised
through profit or loss as an expense in the current year

the goodwill impairment tests carried out during the third quarter of 2014 showed that the present values of the future cash
flows exceed the carrying amounts in all business units the company carried out a goodwill retesting for finlands building
construction at end of 2014 based on the tests there was no need for impairment of goodwill in 2014

forecasts and key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing

cash generating units cash flow forecasts are prepared for a four year planning period based on management estimates based
on actual past performance main assumptions used in the preparation of the cash flow forecasts are the growth of the market
in question the companys profitability development as well as measures which the company has committed to

            comprehensive as the complete annual report which is available at wwwlemminkainencomannualreport2014

main assumptions in the goodwill impairment testing are long term growth and discount rate cash flow forecasts beyond the
four year five years in 2013 planning period are based on the assumption of 1 percent annual growth which was lower than
european central banks target inflation rate over medium term in effect at the time of the impairment testing weighted
average cost of capital wacc calculated for each individual unit is used as the discount factor wacc takes into account
riskfree interest rate illiquidity premium expected market rate of return the industrys beta value country risk and the debt
interest rate including interest rate margin these components are weighted according to average target capital structure of the
sector pretax wacc is determined separately for each tested unit

sensitivity analysis

in connection with the impairment tests sensitivity analyses are made to determine how possible changes in key assumptions
of the unitspecific impairment tests would affect the results of those tests the key assumptions affecting the present value
of cash flows are the development of market and competitive conditions and the discount factor in the sensitivity analyses the
calculation variables affecting these assumptions are varied and the effects of the changes on the margin between the carrying
value and present value of the cash flows are examined

the majority of the companys goodwill is subject to the infrastructure construction operating segment sensitivity analysis
prepared in 2014 show that reasonable and ordinary variation to key assumptions used in the testing would not cause a need for
impairment in the infrastructure construction operating segment neither does the goodwill subject to other nordic countries
the baltics or the russia operations include a risk of impairment according to the sensitivity analysis the most significant risk
for impairment of goodwill arises from the building construction finland operating segment where the units recoverable cash
flow exceeds the units carrying amount by eur 00 million the pronounced risk is a result of the weak general economic
situation in finland that appears in the demand for housing and commercial construction sensitivity analysis show that an
increase in the discount rate or decrease in the long term annual growth rate would cause an impairment of goodwill in the
building construction finland operating segment

foreign exchange rate risk
the aim of foreign exchange rate risk management is to reduce uncertainty concerning the possible impacts that changes in
exchange rates could have on the future values of cash flows business receivables and liabilities and other balance sheet
items exchange rate risk mainly consists of translation risk and transaction risk

translation risk consists of foreign exchange rate differences arising from the translation of the income statements and
balance sheets of foreign group companies into the groups functional currency translation risk recorded in accounting is
caused by equity investments in foreign entities and their retained earnings the effects of which are recorded under translation
differences in shareholders equity lemminkäinen group has foreign net investments in several currencies the key currencies
in which the group was exposed to translation risk in 2014 were the russian rouble and the norwegian krone it is likely that the
most significant translation risk is associated to these currencies in the future too the change in translation differences in
2014 was eur 186 million of which eur 158 million was attributable to the russian rouble and eur 27 million to the
norwegian krone reportable translation risk is also caused by the reporting periods income statement the impact of which can
be seen among others directly in the groups reportable net sales and operating profit in euros in 2014 the impact of
exchange rate changes on the groups net sales was eur 732 million of which eur 400 million was attributable to the
russian rouble and eur 197 million to the norwegian krone and their impact on the operating profit was eur 50 million of
which eur 43 million was attributable to the russian rouble and eur 06 million to the norwegian krone in accordance
with the treasury policy lemminkäinen group protects itself from translation risks primarily by keeping equity investments in
foreign entities at an appropriately low level and thus does not use financial instruments to hedge the translation risks

transaction risk consists of cash flows in foreign currencies from operational and financial activities the group seeks to
hedge business currency risks primarily by operative means the remaining transaction risk is hedged by using instruments such
as foreign currency loans and foreign currency derivatives

the group companies are responsible for identifying reporting forecasting and hedging their transaction risk positions
internally the group treasury is responsible for hedging the groups risk positions as external transactions in accordance with
the treasury policy the general rule is that the major net positions forecasted and known for the 12 months following the
review date are hedged with a hedging ratio ranging from 25100 per cent and emphasising the first six months

the key currencies in which the group was exposed to transaction risk in 2014 were russian rouble and swedish krona these
transaction risk positions were mainly due to sales procurements receivables and liabilities in 2014 the group did not apply
hedge accounting to transaction risk hedging

sensitivity analysis of transaction risk

the following assumptions have been made when calculating the sensitivity caused by changes in exchange rates

  the exchange rate change is assumed to be  10
  the position includes financial assets and liabilities denominated in swedish kronas and russian roubles
  the position does not include forecasted future cash flows
  taxes are excluded in sensitivity analysis

interest rate risk

the aim of lemminkäinen groups interest rate risk management is to minimise changes affecting the result cash flows and
value of the group due to interest rate fluctuations the group treasury manages and monitors the interest rate position the
groups interest rate risk primarily comprises fixedrate and variablerate loan and leasing agreements interestbearing
financial receivables and interest rate derivatives interest rate changes affect items in the income statement and balance sheet

the interest rate risk is decreased by setting the groups average period of interest fixing term to the same as the interest rate
sensitivity of its business the interest rate sensitivity position of the groups business is estimated to be about 15 months the
treasury policy thus defines the groups average interest fixing term as 1218 months the group aims to keep 4065 per cent
of its liabilities per currency hedged

the group can have both variable and fixedrate longterm borrowings the ratio of fixed and variablerate borrowings can be
changed by using interest rate derivatives in 2014 the group has used interest rate swaps for managing interest rate risks part
of the interest rate swaps were used for hedge accounting and a hedging result of those derivatives have been recognised in
interest expenses there was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from hedge accounting during the financial year hedging
instruments assigned to hedge accounting have matured and hedge accounting terminated during the reporting period

interest rate fluctuations in 2014 did not have any unusual effect on the groups business but a significant rise in the level of
interest rates may have a detrimental effect on the demand for housing

sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk

the following assumptions are made when calculating the sensitivity caused by a change in the level of interest rates

  the interest rate change is assumed to be 1 percentage point
  the position includes variablerate financial liabilities variablerate financial receivables and interest rate derivatives
  all factors other than the change in interest rates remain constant
  taxes have not been taken into account when calculating sensitivity

commodity price risk
the groups paving operations are exposed to bitumen price risk the price of bitumen is determined by the world market price
of oil in practise the group protects itself against the bitumen price risk with fixed purchase prices price clauses in sales
agreements and derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied by the closing date the group companies had used
bitumen derivatives to hedge in total 11000 mt 58933 mt of bitumen purchases

credit risk
credit risks arise when a counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligations casusing the other party to suffer a financial
loss lemminkäinen has defined a credit policy for customer receivables that aims to boost profitable sales by identifying credit
risks in advance and controlling them the credit policy sets the minimum requirements concerning trade credit and collections
for lemminkäinen group the groups credit control function defines credit risks and the business units are responsible for
managing them

most of the groups business is based on established and trustworthy customer relationships and on contractual terms
generally observed in the industry the group is exposed to credit risk mainly through the groups trade receivables and
receivables associated with deposits and receivables the maximum amount of credit risk is the combined total of the balance
sheet values of the aforementioned items the amounts and due dates of the groups trade receivables are presented in the
table below the group does not have any significant credit risk concentrations as trade receivables are distributed among many
different customers in a number of market areas the business unit that made the contract actively monitors the receivables
situation if the business units renegotiate the terms of the receivables they must do so in accordance with the requirements of
the groups credit policy the risk of credit losses can be reduced by means of guarantees mainly bank guarantees and bank
deposits in addition lemminkäinen uses factoring arrangements which also mitigates the credit risk

lemminkäinens credit losses have been minimal in relation to the scale of its operations the main risks are associated with
business in russia as a general rule construction projects in russia are only undertaken against receipt of advance payments
if in exceptional situations a credit risk is taken the amount permitted is always proportional to the expected margin on the
project in question receiveables transferred for legally enforceable collection are recognised as credit losses

the group is exposed to counterparty risk when investing liquid assets and using derivative instruments liquid assets are
invested in shortterm bank deposits certificates of deposit issued by solvent partner banks and commercial papers issued by
corporations with a good credit rating the group treasury is responsible for the management of the groups counterparty and
credit risks related to cash financial investments and financial transactions the treasury policy specifies the approved
counterparties and their criteria at the end of 2014 the counterparty risk was considered to be low

management of capital and the capital structure
capital means the equity and interestbearing liabilities shown on lemminkäinens consolidated balance sheet lemminkäinen
groups capital management ensures costeffectively that all of the groups business sectors maintain their business viability
at a competitive level in all cyclical conditions that riskcarrying capacity is adequate for example in construction contracts
and that the company is able to service its borrowings and pay a good dividend

the amount of the groups interestbearing liabilities is affected by factors such as scale of operations seasonal changes in
production acquisitions investments in or the sale of production equipment buildings and land and possible equity related
arrangements the company continuously monitors especially the amount of debt the ratio of net debt to ebitda and the
equity ratio the company also follows the development of equity by means of the return on investment a longterm average in
excess of 18 per cent is regarded as a good return the return on investment in 2014 was 135 per cent 94

we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for equity
securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise the amounts involved may be material we
may decide to hold cancel or sell such repurchased debt possible subsequent sales of repurchased debt may be made against
cash or other compensation or in exchange for equity securities and such sales may be executed as open market offers privately
negotiated transactions or otherwise repurchases or exchanges of outstanding debt or subsequent sales or exchanges of
repurchased debt if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and
other factors

some of the groups financial arrangements include two financial covenants the ratio of net debt to ebitda and the equity
ratio which are monitored quarterly and calculated as an average of four previous quarters which are monitored quarterly and
calculated as an average of four previous quarters the terms of the net debtebitda covenant were not met in the first quarter

quarters of 2014 at the end of the year the company met its covenants

in addition the company has taken several other measures to strengthen its balance sheet and to improve its financial position
in the first quarter the company issued a eur 70 million hybrid bond in the second quarter the company divested its technical
building services business for eur 554 million and used the inbound cash flow from the divestment for repayment of current
liabilities in addition the company issued a eur 100 million unsecured senior fiveyear bond in june 2014 the eur 100
million bond issued by the company was used for refinancing the eur 60 million bond that matured in october 2014 the bond
carries a fixed annual coupon at the rate of 7375 per cent payable semiannually the terms and conditions of the bond include
two financial incurrencebased covenants an equity ratio and net debt to ebitda if the equity ratio covenant is not met the
company is restricted from making certain payments including repurchases of its own shares and redemption of hybrid bonds

the groups equity includes two eur 70 million hybrid bonds with no maturity date the first of these was issued in march
2012 and the second in march 2014 these hybrid bonds are classified as equity instrument but the bond holders do not have
any rights of a shareholders and the bond does not dilute shareholders ownership in the company the hybrid bonds are

are related to the questions of prescriptions and value added tax for example the main oral hearing in the court of appeal will
take place during 2015 the finnish state and 22 municipalities have also submitted their appeals to the helsinki court of
appeal in addition to the claims decided on by the district court in november 2013 21 claims against lemminkäinen and other
