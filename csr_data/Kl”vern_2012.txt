statement by the ceo
the real estate industry is making excellent progress and the profit from property management is at the
same high level as before klövern has succeeded in raising rental levels reducing costs and retaining
its customers at the same time as there is considerable turbulence in the business environment at the
beginning of march we announced that klövern is going to complete the offer for the listed property com
pany dagon which prepares the way for a big step forward towards the stock exchanges large cap list

                                                      after two cold winters with heavy snow it has been
                                                      gratifying as klöverns newly appointed ceo to see that
                                                      this year wont be the third time running sweden didnt
                                                      have any snow before the yearend nor did it come until
                                                      late january 2012 this naturally contributed to a sharp
                                                      reduction in property costs for a comparable portfolio
                                                      during 2011 however we also saw the impact of the
                                                      efforts weve made with energy saving direct charging of
                                                      tenant costs and more efficient property caretaking


                                                      it is even more satisfying to note that we have not only
                                                      succeeded in retaining customers in these turbulent

                                                      and property costs led to a positive development of the
                                                      operating margin which was 63 per cent at yearend

of greater stockholms labour market unemployment is
therefore relatively low
     the market for rented offices is characterized by
stability during almost the whole of the 2000s rental

noted in particular for centrally located and modern
