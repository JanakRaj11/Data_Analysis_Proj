point that we shall comprehend
the most prominent change seen in the last few years is the
esg investmentsalso known as responsible investmentsthat

and the united states
while sri outstanding amounts in japan remain comparatively small at
10 billion us dollars those in europe and the united states are several
hundred times higher at 8758 billion us dollars and 3740 billion us

investment companies specializing in
sri and it was not always clear as to how
financial status and returns should be
treated in traditional sri however the
idea of esg investing is quite different
from that of traditional sri the basic
idea of esg investing is to incorporate
nonfinancial information into ordinary
investing processesin other words
the integration of esg factors the
reason behind the fast increase of esg
investments is because pension funds
and asset management companies
have started to realize that they need
to incorporate esg factors into their
ordinary investment methodologies

clearly explain how financial information and nonfinancial information       efforts of a particular investee company insufficient in certain areas
provided in the report such as esg issues are related to each other          compared with other companies in the same industry you can ask
another important trend is the increasing availability of esg information     questions to the company regarding such shortfalls these questions
