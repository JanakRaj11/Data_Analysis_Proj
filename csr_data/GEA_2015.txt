                                     jürg oleas
                                     chairman of the executive board
                                     of gea group aktiengesellschaft




    dear shareholders
    despite the less dynamic global economic development 2014 was another recordbreaking year for gea
    accordingly we met our guidance for the fiscal year by attaining new alltime highs in terms of sales and
    our operating margin furthermore we substantially reduced our debt while simultaneously completing
    the work on topics crucial for geas future development and setting the course for further changes

    as expected at more than eur 45 billion our order intake remained roughly on a par with the previous
    year a fall in the number of large orders was offset by a marked increase in our breadandbutter business
    embracing order volumes of less than eur 1 million organic sales grew 56 percent and also exceeded
    eur 45 billion it is worth noting that all group segments were instrumental in accomplishing this
    growth by generating record sales we managed to significantly enhance our operating ebitda by
    114 percent to reach eur 591 million this corresponds to an excellent margin of 131 percent until a few
    years ago gea had only managed to achieve such figures in selected portfolio areas moreover at
    90 percent the cash flow driver margin also met our guidance at the same time it must be taken into
    account that this key performance indicator was not adjusted for the oneoff expenses mainly incurred in
    connection with the fit for 2020 project

    both our companys focus on the promising food sector as well as the major reduction in debt has
    prompted the two international rating agencies moodys and fitch to lift their respective rating of
    gea group aktiengesellschaft within the investment grade category these ratings prove a companys
    creditworthiness visàvis current and potential lenders

    the success achieved in the year just ended is also reflected in our rise in share price on november 27 our
    share reached a new 20year high at eur 3852 due to some profit taking at the end of the year the share
    closed at eur 3660 in late december which corresponds to a 58 percent share price increase in 2014
    thus geas share price clearly outperformed both the dax and the mdax in the previous year in 2014
    the stoxx europe tmi industrial engineering benchmark index which is even more important to us
    actually went down

    based on this share price our market capitalization had climbed to approximately eur 70 billion by the
    end of the fiscal year 2014 this makes gea the largest publicly listed company in the world for all investors
    willing to put money into the process engineering sector by focusing on the food processing industry

                                           letter to shareholders




divestment of the gea heat exchangers segment
after having redefined our longterm strategic orientation and geas core business towards our position
as the leading supplier of systems for the food industry back in 2012 we set the course for the divestiture
of our gea heat exchangers segment based on an enterprise value of around eur 13 billion we sold
the segment to funds advised by triton in april 2014 with triton we found a reputable owner for this
segment once the approval from the competent antitrust authorities had been obtained we successfully
closed the sale of the segment within the set timeframe in late october 2014

preparing for the future
at increasingly shorter intervals companies have to gear up to tackle more substantial changes in the
general environment thus a sudden escalation of geopolitical or financial crises like the current
troubles in ukraine or the situation in greece may quickly pose adverse challenges to the global
economy for this reason it is important for a company to be able to swiftly adapt to a wide range of
challenges to remain successful in the long run for this purpose its organization should be very lean
and highly agile moreover we at gea also tend to regard shorterterm projects or our independence
from individual key accounts as a basis for guaranteeing the necessary versatility

in addition we need to secure our outstanding market position through continuous innovation this
means that we keep offering new highly innovative products that serve as trendsetters for the entire
market moreover product leadership also entails a strong brand name at present gea employs
approximately 7000 employees who perform engineering and engineeringrelated activities apart
from fullyfledged mechanical engineers they also include process automation and food engineers
around 800 of these employees work in product development compared with our entire workforce
these figures show how important it is for us to permanently make technical processes more efficient
and thus be the number one choice for our customers

in the course of our portfolio adjustment we also took a close look at the areas in which we intended to
generate our future corporate growth while exploring which organizational setup would be optimal for
achieving this goal this was the starting point for our fit for 2020 project which we launched in 2014

in august we informed the capital markets about the essential contribution this project will make to
our future development optimized organizational structures are to reduce complexity and thus allow
for substantial savings while promoting further growth in the future gea will have much flatter
hierarchies and be closer to the local customers this way we will continue to further strengthen and
expand the sustainable competitiveness of your company until 2020 and beyond

we quite consciously initiated this process at this particular point in time out of a position of strength
following several excellent business years to be in the best possible position to face the challenges that
lie ahead we have a proven track record of successfully implementing comprehensive processes of
change for this reason we can rely on a considerable wealth of experience in tackling the tasks ahead
you will be able to perceive these changes as of the second quarter of 2015 when we will start reporting
our results under the new organizational structure

                                             letter to shareholders




    new mediumterm objectives
    in the previous year we also set ourselves new detailed financial targets to be met by the year 2020
    these targets underline our orientation towards geas sustainable value enhancement in the light of
    our current positive result we are confident that we will be able to realize an annual average organic
    growth rate of 4 to 6 percent as well as a service proportion of roughly 30 percent with a 56 percent
    growth in organic sales achieved in 2014 we were even in the upper bounds of this target corridor
    moreover a service proportion of currently 27 percent goes to show that we are also heading in the
    right direction in this particular area

    however prospects also look promising for other areas due to savings under our fit for 2020 project
    and further growth in volume we expect an operating ebit margin of 13 to 16 percent between 2017
    and 2020 after all we will ensure that we tie up a minimum amount of capital by striving to keep our
    working capital level at between 10 to 12 percent of sales and our investment volume at between
    15 and 2 percent of sales in this way we will make sure that we strengthen our market position and
    further enhance enterprise value

    for you our shareholders the proposed increase in dividend payout ratio to between 40 and 50 percent
    of our net income will surely be appealing with immediate effect you will receive a much higher
    share in the companys profits than in the past

    global customer survey
    our company can only achieve sustainable success if we are a preferred supplier the results of the
    first global customer satisfaction survey have told us more about the way gea is perceived by the
    markets and its customers while identifying areas for improvement we conducted this survey
    amongst customers in more than 20 countries that taken together represent around 80 percent of our
    sales volume at the same time all continuing operations as well as a multitude of industries and
    product groups were included in the survey apart from questions on customer loyalty satisfaction
    with our products services and processes the telephone interviews also comprised a peer comparison
    as well as questions on geas image and brand awareness all in all we can be satisfied with the
    outcome gea received top results in terms of machine quality and performance while there is still
    some room for improvement in a few service areas these findings will be taken into account within
    the framework of the fit for 2020 project with a view to further improving geas customer proximity
    and speed by means of tangible measures and structural changes

    employees
    on behalf of my fellow executive board members and myself i would like to take this opportunity to
    thank our more than 18000 employees for their hard work and commitment over the year my thanks
    expressly include the employee representative bodies as in previous years our employees below
    senior leadership level worldwide will be awarded an extra bonus in recognition of their performance
    for the fiscal year just ended the amount paid out to each employee will once again be equivalent to
    the sum disbursed in the previous year excluding the divested gea heat exchangers segment the
    total amount under the extra bonus totals approximately eur 4 million

                                         letter to shareholders




outlook
the new fiscal year that started only recently will mark another crucial milestone in geas corporate
history apart from ensuring operational success and an even higher level of customer orientation our
most important undertaking will be the finalization and smooth implementation of the new
organizational structure that needs to be filled with life

provided that there is no slowdown in economic growth on the basis of constant currencies versus
2014 and without taking into consideration the impact of acquisitions or oneoff effects we seek to
achieve a moderate organic growth in sales as well as an operating ebitda of between eur 580 million
and eur 620 million under the same conditions our cash flow driver margin is to reach a level of
between 90 and 95 percent

this forecast does not yet factor in first savings realized within the framework of the groups
reorganization against this backdrop we will specify our guidance for business progress in may

our strategy of acquiring companies to open up new markets for gea or specifically expand geas
product portfolio in existing markets will remain unchanged and valid in this way we intend to offer
our customers an increasing range of services from a single source nonetheless in the light of fragile
global financial markets we will put particular emphasis on retaining geas stable credit rating in the
credit markets

dividend
for the successful fiscal year 2014 the executive board and the supervisory board will propose an
increased dividend of eur 070 to the shareholders at the annual general meeting thus the volume
of dividend payout would rise 167 percent to eur 1347 million this dividend payment would hit
another record high and be in line with our new target of distributing between 40 and 50 percent of net
income to you

yours sincerely

     equipment operating segments were combined as of the beginning of fiscal year 2014 and are now
     reported as a single segment gea mechanical equipment

     the former gea heat exchangers segment was successfully sold in fiscal year 2014 see page 50 f
     jürg oleas was also responsible for this segment until the transaction closed

     the other reporting segment comprises gea group aktiengesellschaft and those companies with
     business activities that do not form part of the core business in the main this means internal service
     companies given that this area has no material impact on the group as a whole the management
     report only refers to it selectively

procurement
gea is continuing to focus on strategic procurement standardization and on pooling orders so as to
ensure longterm price stability and reliability on the part of our main suppliers longterm supply
agreements have been entered into with various suppliers in order to hedge commodity price risk and
thus reduce the risk in particular of price fluctuations with regard to the procurement of raw materials
and semifinished products

procurement at gea group is conducted on a crosssegment basis with the purchase of raw materials
components semifinished products and services being pooled both by region and by commodity
groups to achieve this goal the gea procurement council was set up in recent years with the aim of
consolidating the strategic procurement operations by the individual segments teams specializing in
specific raw materials cooperate on a crosssegment basis in order to make the best possible use of
procurement synergies within gea group the gea procurement council stepped up its work in the
past fiscal year allowing gea to better exploit and optimize procurement synergies

gea leveraged substantial optimization potential with tools such as its purchasing portal which has
significantly improved the availability of specific procurement data and groupwide information
sharing as a result procurement staff project managers and engineers can access the relevant data
and information much more quickly specifically this involved both cost and quality improvements
and major simplifications of various processes

gea also stepped up its procurement activities in emerging economies in fiscal 2014 in order to
optimally exploit the cost benefits offered by these markets

gea groups total purchasing volume for its continued operations amounted to approximately
eur 22 billion in 2014 prices for almost all industrial raw materials fell in 2014 at 72 percent this
was particularly the case for the energy sector however prices for metals also fell by around 66 percent
worldwide in the past fiscal year see the world bank commodity markets outlook january 2015

a key focus was on providing further training for employees working in procurement staff from
geas procurement divisions worldwide took part in bestinclass training programs

                   combined group management report  fundamental information about the group




     gea group companies actively used the groupwide classification system gea class which was rolled
     out across the group in 2013 and is designed to provide more meaningful procurement data and to
     establish a unified procurement system for materials and services the system provides detailed cross
     segment analyses of procurement prices and terms it is based on eclss an international standard
     for electronic data interchange between suppliers and customers that is used around the world to
     classify a wide range of products materials and services gea class was developed on the basis of this
     standard system and supplemented by the addition of a number of extra categories resulting in a
     custom solution that enables the transparent and uniform classification of products and suppliers

     of the initiatives mentioned the gea refrigeration technologies procurement project  which was
     implemented at a number of locations worldwide  is worthy of particular mention this project was
     launched in 2013 with the aim of improving the overall effectiveness of the procurement organization
     and hence to make significant cost savings the systematic application of a large number of commercial
     levers to all relevant commodity groups meant that the procurement project made a clear contribution
     to improving the profitability of the gea refrigeration technologies segment in 2014 in the future
     additional crossfunctional cost reduction measures in commodity groups such as assembly services
     switchgears or measurement and control engineering can be driven forward in cooperation with other
     gea segments

     management system

     basis of information
     group reports are prepared with the aid of standard applications that are precisely tailored to the
     needs of gea group and subject to continuous enhancement standard reports prepared on the basis
     of unified data are used throughout the group to report net assets financial position and results of
     operations these standard reports are supplemented by special analyses as well as analyses and
     reports related to specific businesses and strategic measures corporate planning  which covers the
     current budget plus further two planning years  and risk reporting are both based on the same
     reporting and consolidation system that is used for the reporting of actual figures

     routine reporting procedures are supplemented by committee meetings that provide members of the
     group management with an opportunity to share information on strategic and operational issues
     meetings of the executive board of gea group aktiengesellschaft and of the extended management
     board which comprises the executive board members and segment heads are held once a month the
     executive board meetings concentrate on issues of relevance to the group as a whole whereas decisions
     with a direct impact on the segments are prepared in meetings of the extended management board
     before passing to the executive board for approval additionally regular meetings are held with the
     individual segments these are attended by the executive board member responsible for the relevant
     segment along with the cfo segment managers and selected heads of department from the group
     management company such meetings entail detailed discussions of the net assets financial position
     results of operations and business development of the segment concerned separate meetings for each
     segment are also held to discuss earnings for the latest fiscal year and the business plan for the
     following years

key performance indicators
geas overriding goal is to secure a sustainable increase in enterprise value operational management is
based on the key drivers that have an immediate influence on value creation since the company focuses
see page 97 on growth operating efficiency and liquidity management the most important key
performance indicators are revenue earnings and the cash flow driver margin in the process gea
takes an organic view of revenue trends ie before acquisition and currency effects with respect to
earnings the company focuses on operating ebitda gea defines operating as adjusted for effects
resulting from the remeasurement of assets added due to acquisitions and for expenses that are
nonrecurring in terms of their nature or magnitude for the purposes of analyzing and managing
earnings this performance indicator is also adjusted for acquisition and currency effects the cash flow
driver margin is defined as the net amount of ebitda the change in average working capital and
capital expenditure on property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets all as reported
expressed as a ratio to revenue gea also regularly collates a range of other performance indicators in
order to obtain a meaningful picture of the overall situation

revenue is analyzed by region and customer industry on a monthly basis in order to identify emerging
market trends as early as possible in this context we also evaluate leading indicators the gea demand
index gdi  see page 84 and order intake

to enable a rapid response to developments the segments are also required to return regular forecasts
 for the quarters and for the year as whole  for the key performance indicators revenue and operating
ebitda in addition these reports include forecasts of other performance indicators such as order
intake and ebit

in order to create the requisite financial scope to achieve strategic growth and to focus the group even
more closely on cash flow generation a new key performance indicator  the cash flow driver margin 
was introduced in 2012 and was also incorporated into the bonus system for senior management since
2014 this system has also been applied to a larger group of employees

the return on capital employed roce calculated as the ratio of ebit to capital employed provides a
further performance indicator for measuring the value added that is generated by the groups operating
activities it therefore figures in both the groups regular reporting activities and the calculation of
variable performancerelated elements of management remuneration in order to anchor roce even
more strongly at an operational level the roce drivers ebit and ebit margin working capital  the
key driver of capital employed  and the ratio of working capital to revenue are monitored continuously
when calculating capital employed effects arising from the acquisition of the former gea ag by the
former metallgesellschaft ag in 1999 are not taken into account

the difference between the expected roce and the weighted average cost of capital wacc is a key
criterion for investment and portfolio decisions the group calculates wacc on the basis of the
following factors the cost of equity based on the return yielded by an alternative riskfree investment
plus a market risk premium and the beta factor actual borrowing costs and the rate used to discount
pension obligations

     management of capital employed
     resources are allocated within the group primarily on the basis of strategic and mediumterm planning
     this provides the framework for preparing key decisions on core technologies sales markets and
     other strategically important variables

     acquisitions and expansion investments are assessed not only on the basis of key performance
     indicators showing potential returns but also in terms of their importance for achieving the groups
     strategic goals the key economic criterion for evaluating rationalization and expansion investments
     is the net present value the payback period is also calculated as an additional benchmark for assessing
     the risk arising from changing economic conditions

     working capital is another key element of capital employed working capital management begins
     before an order is accepted with the payment terms that are offered or negotiated

     project and activitybased management
     in addition to general management with the aid of the key performance indicators described above the
     group has established individual assessment and approval procedures for customer and investment
     projects utilizing specific thresholds for the different hierarchy levels customer projects are evaluated
     primarily on the basis of their expected margins gross margin on a fully absorbed cost basis and of their
     commercial and contractual risk profile with a particular emphasis on cash flow project management is
     also backed up by extensive project control not only at operating unit level but also  depending on the
     size of the project involved  at segment or group level in the form of a separate reporting system for
     major contracts in many cases the findings gained from this analysis yield suggestions for improving
     internal processes which can be used in subsequent projects at group level the analysis focuses on
     deviations between the calculated and the expected or realized contract margin

     compliance
     compliance  which is defined as measures to ensure adherence to legal statutory and internal
     requirements as well as their observance by group companies  is a key management and supervisory
     task at gea group for this purpose the company established a compliance organization some years
     ago this is headed by the chief compliance officer who reports in this function to the supervisory
     boards audit committee the chief compliance officer is assisted by the corporate compliance officer
     furthermore a segment compliance officer has been appointed for each segment and a company
     compliance manager for each operating company a compliance committee was also established to
     advise the chief compliance officer gea groups extensive compliance program is rounded off by
     classroom and webbased training sessions for the group employees responsible for compliance as well
     as by the integrity system which was introduced throughout the gea group worldwide in 2014 and
     which allows possible compliance violations or infringements of the gea codes of conduct  social
     responsibility principles  to be reported further information on compliance can be found in the
     corporate governance report see page 61 ff

remuneration system and financial performance management
changes in the key value drivers are also reflected in the remuneration of employees not covered by
collective agreements variable salary components dependent on company performance are determined
on the basis of the cash flow driver margin and roce in addition performancerelated remuneration
depends on the achievement of personal goals of which at least one must be measurable in financial
terms a further remuneration component is based on geas share price performance in relation to the

research and development
in todays global markets an engineering corporation such as gea needs to show an enduring
commitment to permanently enhancing its own processes and technologies it is this culture of
innovation that helps secure its continued commercial success in addition to pursuing its own
intensive research and development activities the group also supports cooperative research projects
with its customers and suppliers
geas focus on product leadership is underpinned by the fact that almost 40 percent of the companys
employees are engineers or perform engineeringrelated roles over 800 of these employees are
assigned to product development as a result of their work gea companies filed applications for a
total of 109 previous year 77 new patent families in the past fiscal year
the culture of innovation at gea can also be seen from its various innovation competitions the gea
innovation contest which has been running with great success for a number of years now provides a
showcase for development projects that are potentially less than twelve months away from market
ability the winners of various preselection competitions get to present their projects during one day
of the annual international meeting of the groups senior managers the three winners that present the
most promising developments in terms of market opportunities earnings potential chances of
realization and level of innovation receive total prize money of eur 15 million to boost their
development budgets

                                          the overall winner in 2014 was a freeze concentration
                                          system that offers customers significantly lower acquisition
                                          and operating costs and cuts space requirements by half
                                          this was achieved by switching from a batch process to a
                                          patentpending continuous process in which fruit juice
                                          coffee milk or delicate enzyme solutions are cooled until ice
                                          forms the crystallizer ensures that an optimum amount of
                                          larger ice crystals is formed this suspension is then
                                          separated into the concentrate and the ice in the downstream
                                          wash column fruit juice concentrate can be transported
                                          more cheaply and in a more environmentally friendly

                                          can be used for example to manufacture drugs the
                                          competing alternatives to freeze concentration are vacuum

     patented valve for homogenizers took third place these valves enable nanocellulose to be produced
     for a wide range of industrial applications at a lower pressure and higher throughput

     the gea development contest is designed to promote promising new product ideas that are at an
     early stage of the development process and that still require up to three years until market launch this
     competition too involves groupwide presentations and offers prize money of varying amounts
     in 2014 the first prize went to a simplified biochemical process for producing pharmaceuticals the
     process requires far fewer steps for separating the active ingredients dissolved in the aqueous
     suspension from the insoluble cells that produced it the benefits for the customer are reduced
     downtime and smaller space requirements fewer components also mean less capital expenditure for
     the customer and improved competitiveness for gea the entry that won third prize  a solution for
     filling plastic bottles  has the same aim to consolidate steps in the process second prize went to an
     easytoimplement energy saving method for compressors operating under partial load

     the gea investment fund showcases new product ideas that are primarily implemented through
     groupwide cooperation or in collaboration with external companies and organizations one of these
     ideas demonstrates a way to dispose of saline mine waste water in an environmentally friendly and
     energysaving manner the water is separated using reverse osmosis followed by freeze concentration
     it is then so clean that it does not require further purification a large proportion of the salts crystallize
     out in such a pure form that they are recyclable the remaining waste material is returned to the mine
     after it has been dried at low temperature although geas segments are already using all of the
     necessary technologies for this in food production today the challenge lies in drastically increasing
     capacity while reducing capital expenditure

                                                 many new products were also launched on the market in
                                                the past fiscal year as a result of this intensive research and
                                                development work at the chillventa trade fair alone gea
                                                presented a variety of new products one of these
                                                innovations was an ice generator which was designed to
                                                produce hygienic flake ice for food processing the generator
                                                is the first model in a premium series based on new patented
                                                technology the largest open compressor  which offers
                                                currently unrivalled output and a cubic capacity of 553 m³h
      was also presented this is revolutionizing the commercial and industrial compressor markets as it
     can be used in both in addition visitors to the exhibition could discover a chiller that sets new
     standards in terms of durability space savings and energy efficiency see page 119

     report on economic position
     gea in fiscal year 2014
     the forecast for fiscal year 2014 assumed that demand in geas sales markets would moderately exceed
     the high levels seen in 2013 contrary to this assumption the performance of important regional sales
     markets was worse than forecast at the beginning of 2014 equally in its world economic outlook and
     associated updates the international monetary fund imf was forced to revise its global economic
     growth assumptions downwards three times during the year april july and october after it had
     increased its forecast for 2014 in january see page 27f growth was slower than initially forecast in
     both the industrialized nations and the emerging markets  ie in all of geas key markets see imf

     geas forecast for fiscal year 2014 in the last annual report assumed that there would be no slowdown
     in global economic growth at unchanged exchange rates against 2013 and did not take into account
     acquisition and nonrecurring effects in january 2014 the imf had forecast global economic growth of
     37 percent over the course of the year it successively reduced this prediction  one of the key factors
     on which geas growth forecast was based  to 33 percent october 2014 this figure has been
     confirmed by the imfs preliminary figures for 2014 despite the weakerthanexpected global economic
     growth geas organic revenue rose by 56 percent falling within the longterm target range of between
     4 and 6 percent by contrast the original outlook had predicted only moderate revenue growth for
     fiscal year 2014

     the gea farm technologies segment exceeded our growth expectations by a considerable margin
     the anticipated stronger growth in the gea process engineering segment could not be materialized
     due to the fact that several major projects were initially postponed by customers the segment
     nevertheless posted a new record revenue figure of eur 18521 million

     the 2013 annual report forecast operating ebitda of between eur 550 million and eur 590 million
     for 2014 at eur 5907 million ebitda in fact slightly exceeded the defined target range the figure
     for operating ebitda already includes eur 54 million in burden for exchange rate effects as expected
     all segments contributed to the increase in earnings

a target of between 90 and 95 percent was set for the cash flow driver margin in 2014 at 90 percent
this expectation was also met adjusted for nonrecurring expenses of eur 507 million the cash flow
driver margin would have amounted to 101 percent

on april 16 2014 gea group aktiengesellschafts annual general meeting approved the proposal by
the supervisory board and executive board to pay a dividend of eur 060 per share for fiscal year

macroeconomic environment
as a global engineering company gea considers growth in gross domestic product gdp and hence
the imfs associated assessments to be the key benchmark for its own development the objective is
for geas growth to exceed that of the global economy

according to the imfs preliminary estimates gdp growth in the past year remained unchanged as
against 2013 at 33 percent this means that growth was considerably below the 37 percent figure
originally forecast at the beginning of 2014 on this basis gea had also been expecting higher
economic growth at the beginning of 2014

the primary reason for this lowerthanforecast growth is the global economys performance in the
first half of 2014 which fell short of expectations the weak economic growth particularly in the
united states and in important emerging markets the continuing crisis between russia and ukraine
and the associated sanctions and the situation in the middle east had a greater impact on the global

     economy than had previously been expected although economic growth was boosted to some extent
     by the sharp drop in oil prices as the year progressed this also had a negative impact due to the
     dramatic slump in the income of oil exporting countries and radical investments cuts

     specifically the imf has produced a preliminary growth rate of 18 percent for the industrialized
     nations in 2014 after 13 percent in the previous year the eurozone economy returned to positive
     territory with growth of 08 percent after its earlier slight recession which lasted until 2013
     05 percent growth in the usa is thought to have increased to 24 percent up from 22 percent in
     2013 in germany the imfs experts are predicting economic growth of 15 percent following
     02 percent growth in 2013

     the imf expects that economic growth in the emerging markets continued to slow to 44 percent in
     2014 compared with 47 percent in the previous year the lower rates of economic growth in russia
     and china played a particularly important role here since these countries provide significant
     momentum for their neighbors growth in russia slowed from 13 percent to 06 percent in 2014
     chinas economy is expected to have grown by just 74 percent in the past year following 78 percent
     in 2013 this would be the countrys lowest growth rate for 24 years economic growth is also thought
     to have slowed in latin america declining to 12 percent from 28 percent in 2013

     combination of the gea food solutions and
     gea mechanical equipment segments
     in january 2014 the executive board of gea group aktiengesellschaft decided to combine the gea
     food solutions and gea mechanical equipment segments effective as of the beginning of fiscal year
     2014 this means that the group has been divided into four operating segments since 2014 based on
     the above decision the two segments have been reported as a single segment gea mechanical equipment

     sale of the gea heat exchangers segment to triton
     on april 16 2014 gea sold the gea heat exchangers segment to funds advised by triton the
     transaction closed successfully on october 31 2014 after approval by the relevant antitrust authorities
     the sale is based on an enterprise value of around eur 13 billion

     as part of its gea 2020 corporate strategy the company had previously decided to sharpen its portfolio
     focus in order to further strengthen its position as a leading systems provider for the food industry
     and other sophisticated process industries due to the lack of groupwide synergies gea announced
     its decision to fully divest the segment on june 20 2013

     the triton funds invest in mediumsized businesses in northern europe where the firm focuses on
     three core areas industry services and consumer goodshealthcare at the time of the sale in april
     2014 tritons portfolio covered 25 companies with combined sales of approximately eur 13 billion
     and more than 55000 employees

in the course of 2015 gea will bundle the development and manufacturing of products and the supply
of process solutions into two new business areas equipment and solutions and report on them
accordingly the current segments will be integrated into these two business areas

all customeroriented sales and service activities are to be combined on a local level into a single
organization per country merging the current large number of sales and service companies will
strengthen local competencies realize existing potential synergy even more efficiently and raise
awareness of the common brand gea in the market anchoring an independent regional perspective
in sales and services management is also designed to accelerate the systematic opening of new growth
opportunities especially in emerging markets

in addition administrative functions will be streamlined more strongly standardized and managed
considerably more centrally in the future which is designed to ensure uniform high process standards
globally as well as cost savings the global corporate center will be the central port of call for all
ancillary management and support functions which so far have mostly been organized locally at the
operating units regional shared service centers will take care of the implementation of standardized
administrative processes thus reducing the workload for the operating units

     the aim of fit for 2020 is to achieve annual cost savings of at least eur 100 million by the end of
     2017 according to initial estimates cashrelevant nonrecurring expenditures until then are likely to be
     incurred in approximately the same amount based on todays business volume the implementation
     measures will include worldwide workforce reductions of approx 1000 fulltime equivalents over the
     next 23 years however it will only be possible to detail the exact number of adjustments the timing
     and the affected locations once further analysis has been carried out

     a corresponding project was promptly set up following the resolution by the executive board in
     august 2014 experienced managers from geas various corporate and specialist departments formed
     more than 20 design teams which were tasked with developing proposals for geas new structure the
     goal to be achieved by the beginning of 2015 was to map out geas new organizational structure in
     detail to describe standardized processes throughout the group and to define responsibilities
     this phase of the project was successfully completed in january 2015 see page 60

     acquisitions
     gea acquired all shares of scan vibro on september 14 2014 this relatively small danish company
     manufactures innovative powder transport systems for a range of food sector applications where hygiene
     requirements are particularly stringent

     in addition on october 6 2014 gea acquired all shares of dutch company de klokslag which is one of the
     leading european manufacturers of largescale equipment for semihard cheese production the
     acquisition means that gea is now a fullline provider of process solutions in this growing field gea is
     well acquainted with de klokslags product portfolio since the two companies have worked together on a
     number of occasions over the past few years the transaction closed in january 2015 meaning that de
     klokslag was not included in consolidation in fiscal year 2014 see page 60

     in total these two companies employ approximately 160 staff and generated around eur 40 million
     in 2013

     adding together individual amounts may therefore result in rounding differences in certain cases

     order intake
     the groups order intake declined by 23 percent to eur 45196 million in fullyear 2014 previous year
     eur 46279 million after adjustment for the negative impact of exchange rate changes 10 percent and
     marginal acquisition effects the organic decline was just 14 percent this decline of approximately
     eur 108 million was attributable in particular to large orders of more than eur 5 million by contrast the
     basic business orders of less than eur 1 million saw considerable growth in all segments with an

the overall decline in order intake was primarily due to the dairy processing and beverages customer
industries in contrast the share accounted for by the dairy farming customer industry rose from
under 13 percent to over 14 percent driven by the excellent performance of the gea farm technologies
segment within the other customer industries there was no growth in either the oil and gas or the
power generation industries however this was more than offset by the environment sector and in
particular the marine sector

     at a regional level the decrease in order intake mainly occurred in western europe and in the asia
     pacific region by contrast the growth regions were north america eastern europe and africa with
     doubledigit increases being seen in the latter two areas

     the largest major orders worth over eur 30 million were won by the gea process engineering
     segment in the form of three dairy orders for customers in belgium poland and new zealand as well
     as a beverages project in africa all in all their value amounted to approximately eur 225 million in
     the comparable prioryear period seven major orders were received for over eur 368 million

order backlog
the order backlog rose slightly by eur 221 million to eur 20376 million compared with
december 31 2013 eur 20155 million this was due in particular to exchange rate changes amounting
to eur 626 million

expressed in terms of the order intake for the fiscal year the order backlog represents a range of 54
months previous year 52 months in line with the different types of business performed in the
different segments the order backlog ranges from 16 months in the gea farm technologies segment
up to 85 months in the gea process engineering segment

revenue
in general the same regional and sectorspecific trends apply to revenue as to order intake although
with different time lags however revenue is less volatile than order intake

in fullyear 2014 group revenue increased by 45 percent to eur 45157 million previous year
eur 43200 million at a level with order intake record revenue was generated again despite the
effect of exchange rate changes of 11 percent since acquisitions had no material impact on geas
revenue it rose organically by 56 percent yearonyear a notable feature is that all segments
contributed to this growth with record revenue figures equally they were all responsible for the
growth in the share of revenue attributable to the service business which increased from 267 percent
to 271 percent organic growth in this business amounted to 76 percent in the reporting period

operating ebitda margin operating ebitda rose from eur 2032 million to eur 2206 million with
the operating ebitda margin also increasing by a good 60 basis points to 119 percent  a remarkable
figure for an engineering company this earnings trend was driven in particular by the unchanged
positive market environment with highermargin projects as well as by the greater share contributed
by the service business in addition successful improvements were implemented in the supply chain
in project management and in relation to procurement conditions

     the groups financial management encompasses liquidity management group financing and the
     management of interest rate and exchange rate risks as the group management company gea group
     aktiengesellschaft is responsible for geas central financial management which aims to reduce
     financing costs as far as possible to optimize interest rates for financial investments to minimize
     counterparty credit risk to leverage economies of scale to hedge interest rate and exchange rate risk
     exposures as effectively as possible and to ensure that loan covenants are complied with the goal of
     geas financing strategy is not only to be able to meet its payment obligations whenever they fall due
     but also to ensure that sufficient cash reserves are always available in the form of credit lines in
     addition to maintaining a strategic cash position the centralized liquidity portfolio is managed
     mainly for capital preservation and risk reduction by diversifying the cash investments

     cash flow from operating activities is the most important source of liquidity intragroup cash pooling
     aims to limit external cash investments and borrowings to a level as low as possible to achieve this
     gea has established cash pooling groups in 13 countries that automatically balance the accounts of the
     participating group companies every day by crediting or debiting a target account at gea group
     aktiengesellschaft any additional liquidity requirements are generally borrowed by group
     management which also invests surplus liquidity in a number of cases however liquidity peaks in
     individual countries cannot be reduced on a crossborder basis due to legal or taxrelated reasons

     total assets as of december 31 2014 declined by eur 6326 million or 98 percent as against the prior
     year reporting date to eur 58320 million this reduction is due in particular to the sale of the gea heat
     exchangers segment this caused a significant reduction in assets held for sale and an increase in cash
     and cash equivalents as of the reporting date deferred tax assets also rose the ratio of noncurrent to
     current assets shifted significantly in favor of noncurrent assets which accounted for 465 percent of
     total assets as of december 31 2014 previous year 399 percent

     the eur 2115 million increase in equity represents the consolidated profit of eur 3206 million on the
     one hand and the dividend payment of eur 1155 million on the other currency translation effects
     increased equity by eur 1110 million whereas the actuarial measurement of pension obligations reduced
     equity by eur 955 million the equity ratio improved by 75 percentage points compared with the end
     of 2013 358 percent to 433 percent this was due in particular to the reduction in total assets

noncurrent liabilities decreased by eur 2975 million to eur 15584 million the amount of
eur 4068 million of the revenue generated by the sale of the gea heat exchangers segment was used to
repay financial liabilities ahead of schedule see page 44 noncurrent liabilities in the amount of
eur 1000 million were reclassified as current liabilities due to notice of termination of the european
investment bank eib loan being given in november 2014 in readiness for its early repayment in january
2015 by contrast pension provisions increased

as of the reporting date current liabilities excluding liabilities held for sale were up eur 733 million on
the figure for december 31 2013 at eur 17464 million this was due in particular to increased liabilities
to banks current liabilities to banks rose due to the reclassification of the loan from the european
investment bank but were reduced by the scheduled repayment of loans from kreditanstalt für
wiederaufbau in the amount of eur 305 million other financial liabilities also contributed to the
increase in current liabilities the increase in provisions for personnel expenses was offset by the
reduction in other provisions with no material change overall

liabilities held for sale were no longer required to be disclosed due to the sale of the gea heat exchangers
segment previous year eur 6199 million

     exchangers after december 31 2013 was to the economic advantage or detriment of the purchaser on
     completion of the transaction this means that the sale was completed with economic effect as of

the purchase price was not adjusted to reflect any profit generated by gea heat exchangers between
december 31 2013 and completion of the transaction consequently the profit generated increased the
carrying amount of the disposal group which was written down to its fair value less costs to sell this led
to an impairment loss of eur 224 million which is not included in the figure for operating profit in
addition to the expected transaction costs costs to sell include sufficient provisions for contractual
warranties associated with the sale and for risksharing obligations for large projects

ebit and earnings after tax both decreased in the first 10 months due primarily to this impairment loss
ebit declined by eur 256 million to eur 628 million while earnings after tax fell by eur 285 million
to eur 358 million

     eur 18 million to new account

     the dividend will be paid from the contribution account for tax purposes section 27 of the
     körperschaftsteuergesetz kstg  german corporate income tax act and therefore without deduction
     of investment income tax and the solidarity surcharge in the case of shareholders in germany the
     dividend is not subject to current taxation in the year of payment the opinion of the german tax
     authorities see also the federal ministry of finance bmf circular dated december 22 2009
     paragraph 92 is that the payment of dividends from the contribution account for tax purposes constitutes
     a repayment of shareholder contributions which results in a retrospective reduction in the cost of the
     shares this can lead to the imposition of higher capital gains taxes if the shares are sold at a later date

overall assessment of business development
demand from geas customer markets remained steady in fiscal year 2014 at over eur 45 billion
gea again posted its highest ever revenue despite a slight drop in order intake and negative exchange
rate effects all segments contributed to this growth with record revenue figures operating profit
ebitda was up 114 percent yearonyear to eur 591 million this corresponds to an operating
ebitda margin of 131 percent the groups net debt was replaced by eur 904 million of net liquidity
during the course of the year this was primarily due to the approximately eur 1 billion in revenue
from the sale of the gea heat exchangers segment but also to geas positive business performance
financial liabilities in the amount of eur 407 million were repaid ahead of schedule in the reporting
period with respect to our cash flow drivers a very good ratio to revenue of 90 percent was also
achieved gea therefore remains in robust economic shape
as expected overall there was no further negative impact on earnings attributable to the other
companies classified as discontinued operations

summing up it can be said that all material forecasts relating to revenue profit and cash flow drivers
communicated at the beginning of fiscal year 2014 were met or exceeded and that gea group
aktiengesellschafts hgb net income for the fiscal year made it possible to propose a higher dividend
geas business development in 2014 can therefore be considered as positive

remuneration report
executive board remuneration

general remarks
the remuneration report outlines the key principles applied for determining the total remuneration
of the members of the executive board of gea group and sets out the structure and level of executive
board remuneration furthermore it specifies the principles and the level of remuneration awarded to
the members of the supervisory board

the remuneration report comprises details of the remuneration of board members pursuant to the
german commercial code in accordance with drs no 17 german accounting standard 17 since
gea group complies with the recommendations of the german corporate governance code gcgc
this remuneration report also includes the model tables on executive board remuneration in
accordance with gcgc see page 78 ff

following the recommendation of the presiding committee the supervisory board determines the
total remuneration of the individual executive board members and resolves on the remuneration
system applicable to the executive board the supervisory board reviews the appropriateness of the
remuneration at regular intervals criteria for determining the appropriateness of the remuneration
include the responsibilities of the individual executive board members their respective personal
performance the economic situation the success and the future prospects of the company as well as
the customary rate of remuneration on the basis of benchmarking against peer companies

creating an incentive geared towards successful and sustainable corporate governance represents an
essential element of any decision taken with regard to the remuneration system the latter is to ensure
that the executive board members strive for the longterm success of the company and participate in
a subsequent sustainable value enhancement for this reason a significant part of total remuneration
is tied to geas share performance as well as key performance indicators in particular a combination
of cash flow aspects and the return on capital employed roce ie a ratio for measuring return on
capital this ensures that outstanding performance is adequately rewarded and nonaccomplishment
of set targets results in a reduction in remuneration

the remuneration system that was approved by a large majority of the votes at the annual general
meeting on april 24 2012 comprises nonperformancerelated and various performancerelated and
or variable components the variable remuneration system seeks to provide for a highly balanced risk
and opportunity profile from the shareholders and executive boards perspective and to further
enhance the sustainability of the remuneration system by separating the shortterm and longterm
bonus elements in addition it is comparatively easy to transfer the system to the management levels
below executive board level thereby guaranteeing a better steering of business operations

in the fiscal year 2014 the remuneration of the executive board members was composed as follows

fixed components of remuneration and fringe benefits
the nonperformancerelated component of remuneration mainly consists of a fixed annual salary that
is paid in twelve equal installments at the end of each calendar month

the fixed annual salary paid to jürg oleas during the year under review amounted to eur 1250 thousand
dr helmut schmales fixed annual salary was eur 675 thousand during the year under review the fixed annual
salaries drawn by dr stephan petri and markus hüllmann amounted to eur 550 thousand respectively

                                                combined group management report  remuneration report




     in addition the executive board members receive fringe benefits during the year under review they
     mainly comprised the value of the company car use in accordance with tax regulations accident
     insurance premiums and  for markus hüllmann  the reimbursement of costs incurred for the
     maintenance of two households

     variable components of remuneration
     in addition each member of the executive board receives a variable annual remuneration bonus
     whose level depends on the achievement of specific targets determined by the supervisory board in
     terms of a target achievement of 100 percent the level of variable remuneration equals that of the fixed
     remuneration component target bonus to ensure that both positive and negative developments are
     taken into account the proportion of variable remuneration increases or decreases in the event of
     over or underperformance

     the bonus consists of three components the latter comprise both oneyear and multiyear criteria for
     evaluation each of the three components provides for a cap furthermore all three bonus components
     applicable to a specific fiscal year are limited to 240 percent of the target bonus overall cap at its own
     discretion the supervisory board takes into account extraordinary events and developments which
     indicate that a readjustment of the respective mathematically derived value is appropriate

        individual component weighting of 40 percent
     the individual component of variable remuneration is payable with the next regular salary payment
     following the date of the supervisory board meeting convened to adopt the financial statements for
     the preceding fiscal year its amount is calculated on the basis of 3 to 5 personal annual targets
     determined for the respective fiscal year by the supervisory board when determining these individual
     targets the supervisory board bases its decision on the sustainability of corporate governance in
     particular for example organic revenue growth relative to global economic growth the supervisory
     boards definition of the individual targets also includes their respective weighting

     under the variable remuneration component the individual component has a weighting of 40 percent
     ie 40 percent of the variable remuneration target amount is payable if 100 percent of the target set
     in relation to the individual component is achieved the overall degree of target achievement and
     thus the amount paid out under the individual component is limited to 200 percent of the target
     amount cap

     after the end of the fiscal year the supervisory board decides on the degree of target achievement for
     the year 2014 the supervisory board has ascertained a 1292 percent degree of average target
     achievement previous year 949 percent for the members of the executive board1

        multiyear component weighting of 40 percent
     the multiyear component is payable with the next regular salary payment following the date of the
     supervisory board meeting convened to adopt the financial statements for the preceding fiscal year
     performance measurement under the multiyear component takes place retrospectively for the
     previous three fiscal years the period of assessment covers the respective fiscal year just ended as
     well as the two preceding fiscal years the criteria for evaluation are tied to key performance indicators
     embracing a combination of cash flow aspects the socalled cash flow driver margin and the return
     on capital employed roce




     1 the degree of target achievement is a rounded figure




68                                                              gea group annual report 2014

                        combined group management report  remuneration report




 the cash flow driver margin cfdm target is a simplified cash flow indicator ebitda minus
  capital expenditure in property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets capex minus
  change in working capital on a 12month average calculated as a ratio of revenue the cfdm
  actually generated is calculated on the basis of average values achieved over the previous three
  years the degree of target achievement results from a comparison between the achieved cash flow
  driver margin and the target value or target achievement corridor defined by the supervisory board
  as for 2014 just like the previous year 100 percent of the target is achieved if the groups cfdm
  during the preceding threeyear period averages 8 percent if the cfdm is lower or higher the
  degree of target achievement will go up or down with a cfdm less than or equal to 45 percent
  being equivalent to a target achievement of zero percent while a cfdm greater than or equal to
  1325 percent represents a maximum target achievement of 250 percent

 the level of the roce component roce return on capital employed  excluding the effects of the
  acquisition of the former gea ag by the former metallgesellschaft ag in 1999 which is calculated
  on the basis of average values attained over the previous three years corresponds to the ratio of
  earnings before interest and taxes ebit to the capital employed the degree of target achievement
  depends on the actual roce achieved compared with the target value or target achievement corridor
  of  5 percentage points defined by the supervisory board as for 2014 just like the previous year
  100 percent of the target is achieved if the groups roce averages 19 percent during the preceding
  threeyear period if the actual roce level is greater than or less than this percentage but within
  the defined corridor of  5 percentage points the degree of target achievement is increased or
  reduced by up to 50 percentage points

the key figures cfdm and roce are adjusted for the impact of acquisitions made in the fiscal year
2014 or later with respect to acquisitions such adjustment is effected in the year of firsttime
consolidation and in the following fiscal year as the case may be the adjustment includes all
acquisitions that require the consent of the supervisory board or the presiding committee of the
supervisory board

for calculating the overall degree of target achievement the respective degrees of target achievement
relevant to the individual key performance indicators cfdm and roce are multiplied under the variable
remuneration component the multiyear component has a weighting of 40 percent ie 40 percent of
variable remuneration is payable target amount if 100 percent of the target set in relation to the multi
year component is achieved the overall degree of target achievement and thus the amount paid out
under the multiyear component is limited to 250 percent of this target amount cap

during the preceding threeyear period an average of 79 percent was achieved for the key figure cfdm
which is the result of a cfdm of 50 percent in 2012 of 96 percent in 2013 and of 90 percent in 2014
thus in 2014 the degree of target achievement for the cfdm amounts to 958 percent previous year
786 percent for the key figure roce an average of 205 percent was achieved during the preceding

     threeyear period which is the result of a roce of 167 percent in 2012 of 221 percent in 2013 and of
     226 percent in 2014 thus for the financial year 2014 the degree of target achievement for roce
     amounts to 1148 percent previous year 1068 percent as to the variable remuneration awarded in
     2014 the overall degree of target achievement under the multiyear component amounted to
     1099 percent previous year 840 percent2

        longterm share price component weighting of 20 percent
     the longterm share price component is payable at the end of a threeyear performance period with the
     next regular salary payment following the date of the supervisory board meeting convened to adopt
     the financial statements for the preceding fiscal year performance measurement relating to the long
     term share price component is conducted by taking a forwardlooking approach the period of
     assessment covers a threeyear performance period including the relevant fiscal year as well as the two
     subsequent fiscal years

     under the variable remuneration component the longterm share price component has a weighting of
     20 percent ie 20 percent of variable remuneration is payable target amount if 100 percent of the set
     target is achieved the overall degree of target achievement and thus the amount paid out under the
     longterm share price component is limited to 300 percent of the target amount cap

     performance measurement for the relevant threeyear period is conducted by means of a comparison
     between the performance of gea shares adjusted for dividends and the performance of the stoxx
     europe tmi industrial engineering index tmi ie in which a large number of european industrial

     in relation to the individual component is ascertained on the basis of the targets achieved by the executive

     individual component is calculated by setting up the ratio of this overall degree of target achievement to the
     target amount set for the entire fiscal year the pro rata bonus under the multiyear component for the relevant
     fiscal year is computed by applying the principle of pro rata temporis as for annual tranches outstanding
     under the longterm share price component a distinction is made between annual tranches in relation to
     which the first fiscal year oneyear vesting period of the threeyear performance period has not yet passed
     and annual tranches in relation to which the first fiscal year has already passed in the latter case the pro rata
     bonus is fully vested and calculated without applying the principle of pro rata temporis whereupon it will be
     paid out after the threeyear performance period has elapsed if the first fiscal year oneyear vesting period
     has not yet passed the pro rata bonus is ascertained by applying the principle of pro rata temporis ratio of the
     actual period of service attained during the oneyear vesting period to the full relevant oneyear vesting
     period whereupon it will be paid out after the threeyear performance period

     in addition the respective executive board member receives a severance payment amounting to the total
     remuneration agreed for the rest of the contractual term as a compensation for his premature departure
     from the company for calculating the corresponding bonus entitlement an 85 percent degree of target
     achievement is assumed in relation to the respective target amounts set for bonus entitlements that have
     not yet vested and have been accrued over the course of the current year or further years as the case may
     be the total remuneration for the remaining term is limited to a maximum of two full years of
     remuneration severance payment cap in calculating the cap on severance payment reference is made to
     the executive board members respective total annual remuneration received during the two calendar
     years preceding the termination of the service agreement

     if the executive board service agreement is unilaterally terminated without good cause or terminated by
     the company for good cause any and all outstanding annual tranches not paid out under the longterm
     share price component will be forfeited moreover there is no entitlement to any severance payment in
     the event of the company exercising its right of lawful extraordinary termination of the executive board
     service agreement

     in the event of a change of control the executive board can opt for an early payment at target value of any

     report on risks and opportunities
     risk and opportunity management targets

     gea groups ability to leverage its growth and earnings potential depends on it using the opportunities
     that arise although this in turn is associated as a matter of principle with business risks taking
     calculated risks is therefore part of gea groups corporate strategy to meet the objective of sustainably
     increasing enterprise value it is necessary as far as possible to enter into only those risks that are
     calculable and matched by greater opportunities this requires active risk and opportunity
     management which avoids inappropriate risks monitors and manages risks entered into and ensures
     that opportunities are identified and utilized in good time

     gea groups strategic and mediumterm planning are key components of the way in which it manages
     opportunities and risks these processes are used to prepare decisions on core technologies and
     markets along with the corresponding allocation of resources the objective is to ensure stability by
     diversifying and by concentrating on markets of the future at the same time developments that may
     jeopardize gea groups continuing existence can be identified at an early stage

     opportunities and risks arising from significant operating decisions  for example whether to take on
     orders or to implement capital expenditure projects  are assessed and hence actively managed by the
     relevant departments and decisionmakers at all group levels in a decisionmaking process that takes
     materiality criteria into account

     overall assessment of the risk position and changes compared with
     the previous year

     the identified risks from operating activities and the negative impact on earnings that could result
     have changed only immaterially as against the previous year as in previous years the structure of
     gea group with its regional and industry diversification offers protection to a large extent against
     individual risks clustering into a single risk that could threaten the groups continued existence as a
     going concern in addition gea group is not dependent on individual business partners be they
     either suppliers or customers

     with regard to discontinued operations the risks arising from the sale of the plant engineering
     business were reduced by the agreement reached with the purchaser of lurgi and the further progress
     made in completing the lentjes projects measurement uncertainties still exist in relation to individual
     legal disputes these are described in greater detail in the legal risks section below in addition risks
     arising from the former operations of ruhrzink gmbh were transferred to a municipal development
     corporation belonging to the city of datteln

     as part of its gea 2020 corporate strategy the company decided to sharpen the focus of its portfolio
     in order to further strengthen its position as a leading system provider for the food industry and other
     sophisticated process industries significant progress was made in this area in 2014 with the successful
     sale of the gea heat exchangers segment

     overall no risks to gea group or gea group aktiengesellschaft were identified that alone or in

risk and opportunity management system

risk management system
all group companies are integrated into gea groups risk management system quarterly risk reports
and sizerelated ad hoc risk reports aim to ensure that segment and group management decision
makers are informed promptly about material existing risks and potential risks affecting future
development

the basic principles of an orderly risk management system and the related workflows are documented
in groupwide risk guidelines which are broken down and structured in greater detail regularly by the
segments to meet their specific requirements these guidelines also document mandatory risk
reporting and management requirements compliance with these requirements is monitored regularly
by the internal audit function

risk management instruments such as the risk assessment and advisory committees raacs are
supplemented by a reporting system encompassing evaluated risk reports consolidated financial
projections monthly consolidated financial statements and regular meetings between the executive
board and the segment heads to enable the various risks to be identified and analyzed

gea groups risk management system is based on the management hierarchy risks are reported to
the next highest management level using predefined thresholds

the specific requirements of the groups project business are addressed by risk boards at segment and
group management level before a binding quotation is submitted or an agreement signed the
commercial and contractual terms of potential orders are examined in detail by specialists from
various departments so that risks that cannot be controlled are avoided the risk management system
therefore already comes into play before risks arise in the form of a critical examination of the
opportunity and risk profile of quotations no agreement may be signed if the profile is inappropriate




                                             gea group annual report 2014                                               83

                       combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




     the risk management system is not only designed to identify risks that endanger the groups continued
     existence at an early stage as required by law it also captures all risks that might have a material
     adverse effect on the operating result of a segment or the group

     additional modules were added to gea groups risk management system in fiscal year 2013 in order to
     systematically capture risks and opportunities not covered by the existing systems these make it
     possible to assess risk on a holistic basis

     information is gathered and consolidated in an iterative process across all organizational units in a
     risk  chance scorecard to identify risks that could endanger the continued existence of gea
     group as a going concern all issues are assessed for their financial materiality on a gross basis ie
     excluding any riskmitigating measures and their probability of occurrence in addition the timing
     less than or more than one year of each risk is individually assessed

     the following criteria are used to determine materiality



     opportunities and risks
                                                                              probability

                                               40                           40  60                               60
          low            insignificant           l                                 l                                 m
          middle           moderate              l                                m                                   h
          high          considerable            m                                 h                                   h




     insignificant                       impact on financial and earnings position between eur 025  25 million
     moderate                            impact on financial and earnings position between eur 25  10 million
     considerable                        impact on financial and earnings position  eur 10 million




     this makes it possible to classify both risks and opportunities in accordance with their impact on
     gea group issues with shortterm relevance that have a high h materiality and probability rating
     are initially classified as a significant risk or significant opportunity

     in addition the gea demand index gdi is used to collate estimates by gea groups market experts
     of expected short to mediumterm market developments the gdi makes it possible to obtain an early
     indication of positive or negative market developments in the industries and regions that are relevant
     for gea group

     the data gathered using the risk  chance scorecard and the gdi is processed along with other
     internal and external information in a scenario and sensitivity analysis which simulates the potential
     impact on the groups liquidity see page 90

     adequate provisions have been recognized for all identifiable risks arising from the groups operating
     activities provided that the recognition criteria for liabilities have been met the following section
     provides details of existing risks risks that are not yet known or currently regarded as insignificant
     may also have an adverse effect on business activities

internal control system
gea groups internal control system ics is based on the coso framework and comprises the risk
management system rms as well as other principles measures and rules other components of the
ics while the rms aims at identifying and classifying risks the components comprising the rest of
the ics serve primarily to prevent or mitigate risk using control measures the internal audit function
is another component of the ics

the rms comprises principles measures and rules relating to the early risk recognition system in
accordance with section 912 of the aktiengesetz aktg  german stock corporation act as well as
those relating to other components of the risk management system in the other components of the
ics a distinction is made between principles measures and rules that are related or unrelated to
financial reporting

gea groups ics relevant for financial reporting encompasses all principles measures and rules that
ensure the proper approval and recording of business transactions for monthly quarterly and annual
financial statements the goal of the implemented ics is to ensure reliable financial reporting
compliance with the relevant laws and standards and the costeffectiveness of business workflows

in addition to gea group aktiengesellschaft all group companies are integrated into the ics

the following key principles of gea groups ics must be applied in all business functions clearly
defined areas of responsibility the separation of functions in all areas of activity dual signature
policies compliance with guidelines instructions and procedural requirements manuals the
obligation to obtain comparative offers before awarding contracts protection of data from unauthorized
access and the holding of training sessions to ensure uniform procedures within the group

key measures and rules that are relevant for financial reporting and are designed to ensure uniform
accounting at all subsidiaries are accounting and account allocation manuals a uniform chart of
accounts consolidation and calculation manuals the approval of entries using the dual control
principle and the fact that certain entries can only be made by selected persons to prevent errors
standardized it systems are used in gea groups accounting financial control and finance functions
in all group companies all guidelines and it systems are updated on a continuous basis to reflect legal
and business requirements

compliance with the principles measures and rules set out in the ics as described above is monitored
systematically this takes the form of regular reviews by gea groups internal audit function which
reports directly to the executive board and regularly submits reports to the audit committee the
results enable the elimination of defects identified at the companies reviewed and the ongoing
enhancement of the ics in the group

overall the ics aims to ensure the early identification assessment and management of those risks
and opportunities that could materially influence the companys ability to achieve its strategic
operating financial and compliancerelated objectives

                       combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




     legal risks
     legal risks are not quantified in detail since disclosing the specific probability of occurrence could
     have a material effect on the groups position in current litigation or other legal disputes

     dörries scharmann ag insolvency proceedings
     an action brought by the insolvency administrator of dörries scharmann ag against gea group
     aktiengesellschaft is pending at the düsseldorf regional court the former metallgesellschaft ag the
     legal predecessor to gea group aktiengesellschaft held an interest in schiess ag which later became
     dörries scharmann ag on the basis of that interest the insolvency administrator is asserting various
     claims under company law in particular for equity substitution which amount to approximately
     eur 20 million including possible interest gea group aktiengesellschaft considers the claims that
     have been asserted to be unfounded after the senior expert appointed by the court to decide matters
     relating to equity substitution fully confirmed gea group aktiengesellschafts opinion the higher
     regional court in düsseldorf upheld a motion by the insolvency administrator to disqualify this expert
     in a ruling issued on november 27 2012 how the regional court will proceed in this matter is
     currently unknown gea group aktiengesellschaft will continue to defend itself against all claims

     general
     further legal proceedings or official investigations have been or may be instituted against gea group
     companies as a result of earlier business disposals and operating activities

     adequate provisions have been recognized for all risks arising from both the legal disputes described
     above and other legal disputes being pursued by gea group in the course of its ordinary operating
     activities however the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty
     it is therefore possible that the conclusion of the proceedings may result in income or expenses if the
     amounts that have been set aside for them are higher or lower than required

     performance risks
     the performance risks presented below can take a wide variety of forms the elements of the gea risk
     management system are designed to help identify emerging risks before they materialize so that
     appropriate measures can be implemented on a casebycase basis to avoid negative effects on the
     groups financial position and results of operations as a rule potential business performance risks are
     minimized by avoiding significant dependencies and ensuring a balanced mix of fixed and flexible
     capacities

     gea groups sales markets have a diverse product and customer structure this diversification
     moderates the impact on total demand of fluctuations in demand in specific submarkets however the
     food industry is the main focus of the business a significant decline in demand for food and beverages
     would have a material impact on geas financial position and results of operations gea considers the
     probability of a global decline in demand to be low this risk is rated as medium overall




86                                         gea group annual report 2014

                    combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




a significant proportion of geas business consists of projects that depend on the financing available
to geas customers a general decline in demand shifts in currency parities or a credit squeeze could
make it more difficult to implement such projects for the same reason existing orders could be
deferred or even canceled if such risks were to occur on a global level they would have a material
impact on geas financial position and results of operations the probability of such risks occurring
globally is considered to be low this risk is classified as medium overall due to geas diversified
positioning in particular

although countryspecific conflict situations that may result in risks to the group are monitored
continuously as part of the risk management process the potential risks arising from such situations
are difficult to quantify however no material impact on the groups results of operations is anticipated
this risk is rated as medium overall

on the sales side future prices will depend to a considerable extent on general economic trends any
fall in capacity utilization in the industry could also have a significant negative impact on price levels
and therefore on the financial position and results of operations of gea group thanks to the groups
regional and industrial diversification the probability of such a risk is considered to be low this issue
is rated as a medium risk overall

gea group processes a number of materials such as stainless steel copper and aluminum purchase
prices for these metals may fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions longterm supply
agreements are entered into with selected suppliers in order to lock in the procurement prices used as
the basis for costing orders however the potential risks arising from such situations are difficult to
quantify with respect to procurement current expectations are that prices for key materials will not
increase this risk is rated as medium overall

longterm engineering orders are a significant element of gea groups business some of these
contracts entail particular risks as they involve assuming a significant portion of the risk associated with
the projects completion in addition they may provide for warranty obligations that remain in force for
several years after the projects acceptance technical problems quality problems at subcontractors and
missed deadlines may lead to cost overruns there is therefore an extensive risk management system in
place at group management and segment level to closely monitor orderrelated risks this comes into
play before binding quotations are submitted adequate provisions have been recognized for all
foreseeable risks in this area this could give rise to both risks and opportunities in relation to the
financial position and results of operations as a whole this issue is rated as a medium risk

geas business processes are highly dependent on information technology the failure or malfunction of
critical systems could result in risks relating to confidentiality availability and integrity and key business
processes could be compromised gea protects its it systems against unauthorized access to the extent
that this is economically feasible the relevant security systems are updated on an ongoing basis




                                         gea group annual report 2014                                               87

                        combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




     furthermore the company sees risks in connection with macroeconomic trends if a downturn in the
     economy leads to a reduction in order intake to below the level of the previous fiscal year this could
     have a negative impact on earnings due to capacity underutilization and capacity adjustment measures
     thanks to the groups regional and industry diversification and the fact that it is structured for
     flexibility the probability of this significant risk occurring is considered to be low this issue is
     classified as a medium risk overall

     as contractually agreed defined risks relating to selected orders remained with the group following
     the sale of the former lurgi and lentjes divisions the guarantee period for most of these lentjes
     orders has already expired the other orders have provisionally been handed over to the customers
     and are therefore under warranty under the final agreement entered into with the purchaser of lurgi
     the risks arising from the selected lurgi orders have largely been eliminated for gea group the
     remaining risks are rated as low overall

     the sale of the gea heat exchangers segment resulted in risks in the form of financial obligations
     towards the purchaser these relate to contractual warranties and indemnifications as well as risk
     sharing for major projects this issue is assessed as a medium risk overall with a low probability of
     occurrence

     dedicated and qualified employees are a critical success factor for gea group the group has various
     staff policy measures in place to counter the risk that it will be unable to fill vacant positions adequately
     or that it will lose skilled employees the measures aim to position gea as an attractive employer and
     foster employees longterm loyalty to the group see page 52 f the probability of this significant risk
     occurring is considered to be low this issue is rated as a medium risk overall

     acquisition and integration risks
     acquisitions and internal company reorganizations entail risks resulting from the integration of
     employees processes technologies and products it is possible therefore that the aims of the measures
     in question will not be achieved at all or within the timeframe envisaged moreover such transactions
     may give rise to substantial administrative and other expenses portfolio measures may also result in
     the need for additional finance and may impact negatively on financing requirements and the financing
     structure

     these risks are countered by a structured integration concept and close supervision by internal experts
     as well as specific training measures


     environmental risk
     several properties in our portfolio entail risks relating to environmental contamination and mining
     damage primarily as a result of earlier business activities these risks are countered through
     appropriate measures and supervision by internal and external specialists adequate provisions were
     recognized for the measures in 2014 as in past years this could give rise to both risks and opportunities
     in relation to the financial position and results of operations their probability is regarded as medium
     and their materiality as moderate

financial risks

principles of financial risk management
the executive board has put in place an effective set of guidelines to manage and hence largely limit
or hedge financial risks throughout the group the objectives with regard to protecting assets
eliminating gaps in security and improving efficiency in identifying and analyzing risks are clearly
defined as are the relevant organizational structures powers and responsibilities the guidelines are
based on the principles of system security the separation of functions transparency and immediate
documentation

because it operates worldwide gea group is exposed to currency interest rate commodity price
credit and liquidity risk in the course of its ordinary activities financial risk management aims to
reduce this risk through the appropriate use of derivative and nonderivative hedging instruments the
groups financial risks are quantified in section 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
see pages 150 ff

based on a gross assessment the financial risks described below are considered in principle to be both
considerable and probable for gea these risks are therefore rated as high overall

currency risk
because gea group operates internationally its cash flows are denominated not only in euros but also
in a number of other currencies particularly us dollars hedging the resulting currency risk is a key
element of risk management

the uniform group guidelines for central currency management used within gea group require all
group companies to hedge foreign currency items as they arise in order to fix prices on the basis of
hedging rates currency risks are hedged for recognized hedged items unrecognized firm commitments
and highly probable forecast transactions the hedging periods are determined by the maturity of the
hedged items and are usually up to 12 months but in exceptional cases may exceed that period
significantly nevertheless changes in exchange rates may affect sales opportunities outside the eurozone

affiliated group companies based in the eurozone are obliged to tender to gea groups central finance
unit all outstanding exposures relating to transactions in goods and services in major transaction
currencies most of these exposures are passed on directly to banks at matching maturities depending
on the hedging objective of the derivatives and the related accounting treatment they may also be
hedged as part of a portfolio the hedging of financial transactions and transactions conducted by
subsidiaries outside the eurozone is also closely coordinated with the central finance unit




                                       gea group annual report 2014                                           89

                        combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




     interest rate risk
     because gea group operates worldwide liquidity is raised and invested in the international money
     and capital markets in different currencies but mainly in euros and at different maturities the
     resulting financial liabilities and investments are exposed to interest rate risk which must be assessed
     and managed by central interest rate management derivative financial instruments may be used on a
     casebycase basis to hedge interest rate risk and reduce the interest rate volatility and financing costs
     of the hedged items only the central finance unit is permitted to enter into such interest rate hedges

     credit risk
     financial instruments are exposed to credit risk in that the other party to the contract may fail to fulfill
     its obligations the counterparty limit system used by gea groups central finance unit aims to
     continuously assess and manage counterparty default risk a maximum risk limit has been defined for
     each counterparty which in most cases is derived from the ratings from recognized credit rating
     agencies and credit default swaps cdss appropriate action is taken if the individual limit is exceeded

     the financial standing of potential customers is ascertained before orders are accepted using an
     internal risk board procedure active receivables management including nonrecourse factoring
     nonrecourse financing and credit insurance is also performed in the case of export transactions
     confirmed and unconfirmed letters of credit are used alongside sureties guarantees and cover notes
     including from export credit agencies such as euler hermes in addition to local monitoring by the
     subsidiary in question gea group oversees the main credit risks at group management level so that
     any accumulation of risk can be better managed

     since trade receivables are usually due from a large number of customers in different sectors and
     regions there is no concentration of risk valuation allowances take account of specific credit risks

     so as to reduce the credit risk involved derivative financial instruments are only entered into with
     reputable financial institutions whose creditworthiness has been classified as reliable under the
     counterparty limit system described above this is also continuously monitored

     the maximum exposure for the financial assets is limited to their carrying amount

     liquidity risk
     gea group is exposed to liquidity risk in that it may be unable to meet payment obligations because it
     has insufficient cash funds at its disposal the central finance unit is responsible for managing this
     risk cash funds are arranged and credit lines managed on the basis of a multiyear financial plan and
     a rolling monthbymonth cash forecast the funds are then made available to the companies by group
     management cash pools have been established in a growing number of countries in order to optimize
     the use of cash funds and borrowing within gea group to mitigate liquidity risk gea group will
     continue to use various financing instruments in the future so as to diversify its sources of funding
     and stagger maturities

                   combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




the impact of potential risk scenarios on changes in liquidity is simulated on a quarterly basis all
internal risk management information and internal and external information on potential market and
other external risks is taken into account on the basis of this the executive board and supervisory
board have agreed strict rules regarding the level of cash and longterm credit lines to be held to cover
potential liquidity risk

tax risks
the applicable national tax legislation may affect the use of loss carryforwards and thus the
recoverability of the deferred taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements and current
taxation furthermore future changes to the ownership structure could significantly reduce or even
render impossible the use of german loss carryforwards section 8c of the körperschaftsteuergesetz
kstg  german corporate income tax act the ability to use us loss carryforwards could also be
restricted in the case of certain changes to the ownership structure of gea group aktiengesellschaft
under irc section 382 limitation on net operating loss carryforwards following an ownership change

moreover in germany and abroad there is considerable uncertainty regarding future changes to and
the application of tax legislation as a result of tighter public sector finances the resulting pressure for
reform and tangibly greater scrutiny by the tax authorities

the tax risks presented could have a material effect on geas financial position and results of
operations the occurrence of material negative effects is considered to be relatively unlikely




                                        gea group annual report 2014                                            91

                       combined group management report  report on risks and opportunities




     opportunities

     overall assessment of opportunities and changes compared with the previous year
     gea groups end markets offer a variety of opportunities for positive business performance over the
     long term a key task of the opportunity and risk management system is to systematically evaluate
     internal and external information in order to identify opportunities at an early stage and appropriately
     assess the potential they offer see page 83 f specific measures are then developed to enable us to
     convert opportunities into actual economic success

     the identified opportunities from operating activities and the additional positive impact on earnings
     that could result have not changed significantly as against the previous year

     planning of the groups economic development is based on certain assumptions regarding the
     development of the performance parameters described below if these parameters develop more
     positively than expected overall this could have a corresponding effect on gea groups financial position
     and results of operations

     performance opportunities
     gea group is entering fiscal year 2015 with an unchanged high order backlog further growth is
     expected in the rapidly expanding asian markets in the medium term gea group will further expand
     its presence in these regions and thus participate in the growth of these markets

     if the expected moderate growth in the global economy materializes geas continued focus on the
     food end market will allow it benefit more than average especially in growth markets

     in the area of food process technology geas growth will be driven not only by an increase in the
     standard of living and the trend toward highquality foods but also by the expected rise in production
     and quality standards as well as innovative process improvements and new product developments

     geas indepth understanding of our customers production processes is a cornerstone of its success
     increasing scarcity of resources means that ever more efficient use needs to be made of raw materials
     and energy in addition end consumers rising demands require the implementation of higher quality
     standards in production processes growing awareness of our environmental impact means we must
     meet more stringent standards on co2 emissions for example this creates additional opportunities
     for gea group which can focus research and development activities on environmentally friendly
     technologies and production processes and thus offer specialist solutions

     gea considers the probability of the performance opportunities exceeding the planning assumptions

                       combined group management report  report on expected developments




     report on expected developments
     gea groups report on expected developments takes into account relevant facts and events that were
     known at the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements and that could influence
     the future development of its business

     economic environment in 2015

     global economy
     as described in the section on the macroeconomic environment in the report on the economic position
     see page 27 f gea as a global engineering company considers global growth in gross domestic
     product gdp and the corresponding imf forecasts to be key benchmarks for its own performance

     in the january 2015 update to its world economic outlook the imf reduced its forecast for global
     economic growth in 2015 against its october 2014 estimates the key factors behind this adjusted
     outlook are the decreased growth rates in china russia the eurozone and japan as well as the fall in
     oil prices and the associated drop in activity among oil exporters the imfs economists now expect
     global growth of 35 percent in 2015 in the following year they expect the global economy to pick up
     slightly achieving growth of 37 percent the forecast growth rates for 2015 and 2016 are both
     03 percentage points below the figures published last october

     overall the imf says that while the global economy is benefitting from the low oil prices especially in
     the major economies these benefits are more than offset by negative factors such as the clear decline in
     investments according to the imf too many countries are still suffering the effects of the severe crisis
     including high unemployment and debt it believes that too little is being invested and consumed overall

     growth in the industrialized nations
     the imf sees only a slight change in the overall outlook for the industrialized nations in fact the
     significantly increased growth forecast for the usa resulted in a slight improvement in the outlook
     for 2015 which rose by 01 percentage points to 24 percent the growth forecast for 2016 remains
     unchanged and also amounts to 24 percent

     more specifically the imf has reduced its eurozone growth forecast by 02 points to 12 percent this
     year due to weaker investment prospects growth in the coming year is also expected to be a mere
     14 percent this is 03 percentage points lower than previous forecast as is also the case in japan the
     imf is worried about stagnation and low inflation in the eurozone the imf expects the german
     economy to grow by just 13 percent this year followed by 15 percent in 2016 this represents a drop of
     02 and 03 percentage points respectively compared with the last forecast

     the growth forecast for the usa was revised upwards due to strong domestic demand increasing
     markedly by 05 percentage points to 36 percent this means that the worlds largest economy has
     recovered more quickly than was previously expected the positive growth is set to continue in 2016
     rising by 03 percentage points as against the previous forecast to 33 percent

                  combined group management report  report on expected developments




growth in the emerging markets
by contrast growth forecasts for the emerging markets including china and russia were significantly
reduced overall the imf expects growth of just 43 percent in 2015 and 47 percent in 2016  a reduction
in its outlook for these key regions of 06 and 05 percentage points respectively

the imf again reduced its economic growth forecast for china which to date has been one of the
worlds most important growth regions the chinese economy is now expected to grow by just
68 percent this year 03 percentage points lower than previously forecast this would be its lowest
growth rate since 1990 demand in china is failing to meet expectations according to the fund that
said the imf expressly welcomed chinas decision to reduce the economys dependence on the real
estate sector and the shadow banking system and to stimulate domestic demand however it said that
the slowdown in china is also having a knockon effect on the forecasts for other asian regions

the imf is particularly negative about russias growth prospects the country has been hit hard by the
dramatic drop in global oil prices and the sharp depreciation of the ruble added to this are negative
factors such as the international economic sanctions resulting from the conflict in ukraine the imf
expects the russian economy to contract by 30 percent in 2015 down a substantial 35 percentage
points on its previous forecast the predicted recession in russia will also have a negative impact on
growth in other eastern european countries

economic risks
according to the imf there are also serious economic risks in addition to the developments in the
individual regions of the world these include the different monetary policy approaches being taken in
the major economies the prospect of the first interest rate rise in the usa since 2006 could have an
adverse effect on the emerging markets and global financial stability the strong us dollar could also
negatively impact weaker economies

food industry
the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the uns food and
agriculture organization fao anticipate in their oecdfao agricultural outlook 2014 that demand
for agricultural products will remain stable although growth rates will be slower than in the past
decade although cereals will remain the staple human food the forecast states that growing incomes
urbanization and changes in eating habits will increasingly contribute to changes in many peoples
diets foods that are higher in protein fat and sugar will assume greater significance

according to the forecast livestock and biofuel production are projected to grow at a faster rate than
crop production in the next decade crop prices are expected to decline for the next one or two years
before stabilizing at levels above those observed pre2008 albeit significantly below recent peaks
meat dairy and fish prices are expected to rise in the long term

                       combined group management report  report on expected developments




     economic environment for gea
     geas planning for the current 2015 fiscal year assumes that demand in its sales markets will be
     moderately higher than the high levels seen in 2014

     the groups enduring success is founded on a number of major global trends

     1 the continuous growth in the global population
     2 the growing middle class
     3 the growing demand for highquality foods and beverages
     4 the increasing demand for production methods that are efficient and conserve valuable resources

     the united nations assumes that the worlds population which currently stands at approximately
     73 billion people will rise over the coming years by around 80 million people per year see world
     population prospects 2012 world urbanization prospects 2014 according to un estimates the
     population should increase to nearly 82 billion in the period up to 2025 this means that in future
     significantly more food will have to be produced on more or less the same cultivation area for this
     reason the methods and production processes used must become much more efficient  which is why
     innovative process technology is needed

     linked to this growth is an increasing degree of urbanization the number of people living in towns
     and cities rose from 746 million in 1950 to 39 billion in 2014 this means that at 54 percent more than
     half of the worlds population now lives in urban areas this figure is set to expand by a further
     25 billion people by 2050 particularly in asia and africa in addition more and more foods must be
     preserved for longer and be easier to transport in order to secure the necessary supplies for metropolitan
     areas and to maintain world trade here as well only stateoftheart technologies can provide the
     capacity needed to cope with rising demand

     another factor is that as the middle class grows so will the number of people who will be able to
     afford processed foods beverages and dairy products this is equally true for pharmaceutical products
     which must meet the needs of an increasingly healthconscious population
     against the backdrop of the trends in the global economy and the food industry presented in this
     chapter and the impact of the various megatrends on its direct sales markets gea is expecting growing
     demand for highquality foods and linked to this ongoing high levels of investment in the food
     industry additionally gea is anticipating sustained customer interest in process optimization for
     improving efficiency productivity energy usage and plant availability which its technologies are able
     to provide

     the world bank expects that the acrosstheboard declines in industrial commodity prices energy
     metals and minerals and agricultural raw materials will continue in 2015 see commodity markets
     outlook january 2015 for example metal prices are expected to drop by a further 53 percent on
     average largely due to reduced demand in china which previously accounted for almost half of global
     metal consumption

                  combined group management report  report on expected developments




the company does not believe that customer project finance will be significantly affected by
uncertainty in the capital markets

the proportion of geas revenue accounted for by the food industry in 2015 is expected to remain at
its current high level from a regional perspective too gea is not anticipating any significant change
in the current breakdown of revenue in 2015 as against the past fiscal year

business outlook
provided that there is no slowdown in global economic growth and that exchange rates remain the
same as in 2014 and excluding the effect of acquisitions and nonrecurring items we are aiming for our
key performance indicators to develop as follows in the current fiscal year

revenue
gea group is aiming to generate moderate organic revenue growth in 2015 the gea mechanical
equipment and gea process engineering segments are expected to record slight to moderate growth
while the gea refrigeration technologies segment should see aboveaverage growth this forecast
which is below the increase achieved in 2014 is largely due to the lower growth in capital goods that is
expected in light of lower growth rates in the emerging markets although the significant fall in oil
prices will generate growth momentum  with the exception of the oil processing industry and in the
oil producing countries  the necessary structural reforms in some countries and the ongoing high
geopolitical risk are perceived as having a negative impact on global economic growth

earnings
we expect operating ebitda to reach eur 580 million to eur 620 million during this period no
major differences in earnings trends between the gea group segments are expected the term
operating means that the earnings figures are adjusted for the effects of the remeasurement of new
assets resulting from acquisitions as well as expenses that are nonrecurring in terms of their type or
amount

cash flow driver margin
with respect to our cash flow drivers ie the net amount of ebitda the change in working capital and
capital expenditure we are aiming for a ratio to revenue of between 90 percent and 95 percent in 2015

                        combined group management report  report on expected developments




     further expectations

     acquisitions
     we are maintaining our strategy of acquiring companies that provide gea with an entry into new markets
     or that selectively expand our range of offerings in existing markets this will enable us to provide our
     customers with a singlesource solution for an everbroader range of products and services however
     given the uncertainties on the global financial markets we shall continue to focus closely on the financial
     feasibility of such projects with the aim of ensuring a stable credit rating for gea in the debt markets

     dividend
     the executive board and supervisory board will propose a dividend of eur 070 per share for 2014 to
     the annual general meeting this represents an increase in the total dividend of 167 percent to
     eur 1347 million this dividend payment would also be in line with our new objective of distributing
     between 40 and 50 percent of net income to our shareholders

     summary
     provided that there is no slowdown in the global economy we expect the group to achieve moderate
     organic growth the further increase in profitability together with the ongoing focus on liquidity
     generation should help ensure we have the financial leeway to successfully implement our strategic
     growth targets with regard to the distribution ratio our longterm objective is to distribute between
     40 and 50 percent of net income to our shareholders

performance of gea group shares on the capital markets
developments on the international capital markets in 2014 were dominated by the continuing
expansionary monetary policy measures taken by the central banks as well as by economic and in
particular geopolitical factors and associated volatility although the global stock markets initially
continued their rally at the beginning of the year they gave up their gains again at the end of the first
quarter due to increasing concerns about the crimea crisis and economic growth in china driven by
more expansionary monetary policy measures by the ecb the international stock markets continued
their positive performance in the second quarter pushing the dax past the 10000 point mark for the
first time in its history to 10009 points on june 9 very weak economic data for the european economic
area and fear of an ebola pandemic led to a slump on the stock markets at the beginning of october
pushing indices down to their annual lows on october 15 the dax reached a low of 8572 points and
the stoxx europe tmi industrial engineering 30775 points the mdax reached its annual low of
14733 points on october 16 additional expansionary monetary policy measures by the bank of japan
led to a strong recovery by the stock markets in the middle of october the dax reached an alltime
high of 10087 points on december 5 it closed on december 30 at 9806 points up 27 percent over the
course of the year the mdax also reached its highestever level on december 5 at 17184 points it
closed on december 30 at 16935 points a 22 percent gain the stoxx europe tmi industrial
engineering index ended the year at 34093 points a decline of 14 percent over the course of the year

geas share price performed encouragingly over the course of the fiscal year in a market environment
dominated by strong economic and political factors geas shares also rose at first on the back of the
stock market rally at the start of the year reaching eur 3591 on january 22  the highest price in the
last two decades profit taking as a result of the weakerthanexpected outlook for fullyear 2014 that
was announced on february 6 put geas shares under pressure pushing them down to an annual low
of eur 3042 on april 15 during the general market correction of cyclical stocks in particular the
announcement of a new group structure plus associated savings targets and a higher dividend payment
policy then led to strong gains allowing gea shares to clearly break through their resistance level of
eur 36 in the fourth quarter on november 27 gea group aktiengesellschaft shares reached
eur 3852 a new high for the last 20 years as a result of profit taking at the end of the year gea
shares achieved a closing price of eur 3660 on december 30 an increase of 58 percent in 2014 this
meant that the shares significantly outperformed the dax the mdax and the even more important
stoxx europe tmi industrial engineering benchmark index in the past fiscal year

      dividend proposal
      the executive board and supervisory board of gea group aktiengesellschaft will propose to the
      annual general meeting on april 16 2015 that an increased dividend of eur 070 per nopar value
      share be paid again for fiscal year 2014 previous year eur 060 as a result the distribution ratio is
      within the new target range which was raised from onethird of the groups earnings to between
      40 and 50 percent this represents a dividend yield of 19 percent on the share price of eur 3660 on
      december 30 2014

      the dividend will be paid from the contribution account for tax purposes section 27 of the
      körperschaftsteuergesetz kstg  german corporate income tax act meaning that investment income
      tax and the solidarity surcharge will not be deducted in the case of shareholders in germany the dividend
      is not subject to current taxation in the year of payment the opinion of the german tax authorities see
      also the federal ministry of finance bmf circular dated december 22 2009 paragraph 92 is that the
      payment of dividends from the contribution account for tax purposes constitutes a repayment of
      shareholder contributions which results in a subsequent reduction of the costs of the shares this may
      lead to taxation of higher capital gains when shares are subsequently sold

segment to repay its financial liabilities this highlights how important it is for gea to maintain its
investment grade rating and also serves to improve its financial result specifically two loans totaling
around eur 72 million from kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau kfw were initially repaid in addition
gea repurchased bonds amounting to eur 125 million the remaining bonds totaling approximately
eur 275 million are still due in april 2016 the company also repaid borrowers note loans amounting
to eur 210 million in december 2014

      corporate governance
      gea places a high priority on transparent and responsible corporate governance and management
      aimed at longterm value enhancement its activities are based on recognized corporate governance
      principles and fully comply with the recommendations of the german corporate governance code in
      addition gea group has an extensive compliance organization

      a detailed presentation of corporate governance matters can be found in the corporate governance
      report included in this annual report see page 61 ff

      compliance
      compliance is geas top priority this is why all gea managers and employees must comply with the
      law and the relevant guidelines wrongful and even criminal actions as well as violations of internal
      corporate guidelines will not be tolerated gea has drawn up detailed guidelines  in particular an
      anticorruption guideline  that come with binding guidelines for action periodic training and
      monitoring help avoid or detect noncompliant conduct at an early stage in this context employees
      may be instrumental in drawing attention to potential compliance violations

      against this backdrop gea globally introduced the socalled integrity system back in december 2014
      hereby employees  including external third parties for instance business partners  are given the
      possibility of directly reporting severe compliance issues or violations of the codes of conduct via an
      internetbased system in this respect gea attaches importance to an open corporate culture

      the integrity system offers an additional communication channel if the standard reporting lines fail
      to apply for instance this may be the case if immediate action is required in the event of gross
      misconduct this system also allows anonymous reporting as far as this is permitted in the country in
      question nonetheless this system shall not constitute a general platform for complaints therefore it
      only comprises reporting categories that embrace a substantial risk to the company its employees and
      all other stakeholders

      further information on compliance matters can be found in the corporate governance report included
      in this annual report see page 61 ff

the group management level includes areas that are dedicated to diversity company values and crisis
management moreover a health safety  environment hse organization was set up

leadership principles
at gea we are convinced that we can achieve a lot more by working with rather than merely alongside
one another in order to establish this kind of corporate culture gea has defined clear principles that
must be observed by all managers moreover the company has identified the necessary core skills that
are to go with them

    1 the will to lead

    2 management capabilities

    3 personal integrity

cooperating with one other strengthens gea group as a whole this too has been a key factor in
cementing geas position as one of the most successful mechanical engineering companies worldwide
 an achievement that will benefit all segments and every single employee

leadershipgea
to ensure optimal human resources development we have broken the five principal requirements for gea
managers down into 12 qualities that ideally they should already possess when joining the company these
qualities also constitute the main pillars of our initial and further management training modules specifically
these qualities include a downtoearth mentalityrespect for others integrityauthenticity vitality drive
empathy intuition good communication skills the ability to see the big picture an appreciation of the efforts
of others a commitment to sustainably developing our management culture the ability to reason as well as
resilience each of these qualities has been defined in a detailed and intuitive manner that precisely conveys
what the group expects with regard to each of them

      safety management
      unforeseeable incidents such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks can also have severe consequences
      for gea such incidents may also endanger the safety health and even the lives of group employees
      the topic of employee safety is presented in detail on page 110 f

      in order to prepare as effectively as possible for such material corporate risks gea has implemented a
      comprehensive safety management strategy at all levels of the company the groups major incident
      manual provides all employees with clearly defined criteria for ensuring the early detection evaluation
      and reporting of critical incidents this manual also contains measures and detailed contingency plans
      designed to allow a rapid and appropriate response in an emergency moreover it names qualified
      contact persons within gea

      in 2014 gea also rolled out a new software designed to map the entire company in terms of various
      hserelevant kpis which has given rise to a completely new data pool these data are constantly
      monitored with causes of accidents being investigated analyzed and communicated to the workforce
      to prevent new accidents to name but one example a newly created dedicated section of our intranet
      site is used for this purpose the system represents a combination of various solutions that were
      tailored to geas specific requirements this allows for detailed possibilities of investigation and
      corrective actions bespoke to meet geas needs

      furthermore a serious events reporting system was launched to report fatal or severe accidents
      fires explosions or environmental incidents to relevant employees as fast as possible this allows gea
      to rapidly and effectively respond to such incidents and mitigate their impact

      socially sustainable
      gea fully accepts its obligation to make a contribution towards the sustainable development of society
      both within the company by acting as a responsible employer and in the wider social context

      a responsible employer
      with its large number of companies some of them very small gea has a special structure in addition

diversity




gea operates in a challenging international market environment with a large number of players who
influence the company in many different ways  ranging from customers competitors and employees
down to the government and society in general companies can rise to the many challenges associated
with this extremely diverse cultural environment by being aware of diversity and by actively creating it
within their own ranks diversity is defined as the composition of the workforce in terms of
internationality gender age and qualifications gea recognizes that diversity is a strategic success factor
as diversity implies strength

the corporate diversity management function at group management level is responsible for firmly
embedding diversity in geas corporate culture in order to support the business of all segments geas
diversity management is based on a diversity organization in all segments an international team of
diversity managers comprised of women and men from a whole range of different functions is to
represent the spirit of diversity throughout the company

in order to promote diversity on as many levels as possible and for example to create an attractive
working environment gea also intends to increasingly introduce aspects of modern work flexibilization
schemes while increasing mobility within the company

diversity criteria are included as a matter of course when recruiting and appointing staff one of the
objectives is to recruit more women to gea and to involve a greater number of talented female employees
in internal employee development initiatives furthermore diversity management is one of the key ways
in which employee potential and talent can be reliably identified in line with this the entire pool of
future executives is to receive training in the above gea diversity criteria

a catalog of gea diversity performance indicators is used to measure the success and progress made in
the field of diversity management in this way both the degrees of target achievement and the success of
diversity measures are established at group management segment and company levels each of them
being measured against the following three criteria performance potential and diversity

the current proportion of women in the total workforce amounts to 18 percent at management level
they account for a total of 12 percent at the more narrowly defined level of the top 400 executives
however the proportion of woman falls to around 6 percent in terms of the international composition of
its workforce gea employs over 90 different nationalities 60 percent of the workforce either comes
from germany 34 percent or the rest of western europe while around 15 percent are from the asia
pacific region at the level of the top 400 executives over 48 percent are from germany while 7 percent
originate from the asiapacific region

      a further measure introduced to institutionalize diversity management within the company was an
      official diversity policy in tandem with a guideline for executives this policy describes the overriding
      goals and the steady state of diversity management within gea the guidelines provide managers with
      an instrument for implementing diversity management at all group levels

      on account of its importance to corporate culture the topic of diversity is closely entwined with geas
      corporate values in this respect diversity is an engine for change towards more diversity of thought and
      action

      corporate values
      gea vision and gea values are the cornerstones of geas management philosophy they are the
      crucial elements of a common gea identity by establishing the corporate values of excellence
                                                     responsibility integrity passion and gea
                                                     versity gea has created a reference and
                                                     orientation system that provides a common
                                                     understanding and guideline governing the
                                                     personal behavior of managers and employees
                                                     we stand for excellence in everything we do we
                                                     work with passion we walk the talk we feel
                                                     responsible for our actions we cross borders
                                                          thus the set gea values promote both the
                                                          interaction with and between employees at the
      end of the day our gea values are to increase the level of efficiency and professionalism in all gea
      segments and gea companies while supporting a constructive dialogue inside and outside the
      company


      work and family life
      gea has implemented a host of measures to help employees reconcile the demands of work and family
      life including competent contact persons for expectant mothers and fathers as well as a sponsorship
      program for mothers and fathers on parental leave companyorganized childcare flexible working
      hours and opportunities to work while on the move

      for instance since march 2014 gea employees at the bochum site have also been offered the possibility
      of placing their children in daycare at the awokita nursery located nearby there are places for
      children of all age groups with gea covering all expenses incurred places in full day care allow the
      children to play with kids of the same age and to enjoy a versatile leisure and development program

      employee safety
      in order to work productively and fully harness their potential employees need a pleasant and safe
      working environment the requirement to offer all employees safe conditions in the workplace is
      enshrined in geas global business conduct policy which obliges our managers to guarantee the best
      possible health and safety conditions in every gea group workplace worldwide even in countries
      with less stringent safety requirements locations are still subject to gea groups higher standards

gea safety management also provides a comprehensive service for all employees traveling worldwide

organize personal protection for any employee and at any location worldwide at short notice the
medical support service hotline provides assistance with healthrelated issues and in the event of
illness ensures appropriate medical care or repatriation if need be using a security app and a mobile
device gea employees can also obtain medical and safety information on a group location at any time
or directly contact the 24hour hotline at the gea security center via an emergency button this fills a
gap in the chain of communication while further enhancing the service provided to employees by the
gea security center

gea also maintains a continuously updated database that embraces the locations of all employees on
business trips worldwide in the event of a regional crisis this socalled travel tracker enables it to
respond rapidly and provide employees with active assistance

require rapid and unbureaucratic financial assistance in a groupwide agreement with the works
council gea has pledged to unbureaucratically provide financial assistance under such circumstances
employees affected in this way but also the families of employees who suddenly pass away may turn
to the gea aid commission for help

company pension scheme
gea wants all its employees to be able to enjoy their welldeserved retirement this also includes the
financial security to enjoy an appropriate standard of living in many countries however the impact of
demographic change increased life expectancy and high unemployment rates places a growing
financial burden on state pension systems private and especially company pension schemes play an
increasingly significant role in closing such a pensions gap for this reason the company provides an
efficient pension scheme for all its employees

like the remuneration system geas executive pension scheme is based on a combination of fixed
components and performancerelated parameters

gea group also offers an attractive performancerelated pension scheme for employees below senior
management level in germany for instance this is based on an employeefinanced deferred
compensation plan employees can elect to defer receiving a portion of their salary that is instead
contributed to the pension plan if an employee chooses this option gea group tops up the basic
employee contribution with an additional employer contribution the latter is financed by the company
and performancerelated

comprehensive healthcare provision
a healthconscious workforce is important for the longterm sustainable development of a company
because healthy employees are more productive more reliable and more motivated gea therefore
supports its employees with a variety of active healthcare offerings

ecologically sustainable
sustainability in the ecological sense is based on the principle of protecting nature and conserving its
limited resources geas innovative products make an important contribution to this cause since in
the world of process technology and engineering the days when ecology and the economy embraced
conflicting goals are long gone our customers can help promote climate protection by using machinery
components systems and plants produced by gea while environmental protection is also accorded its
rightful place within the company

environmental protection within gea
geas key environmental objectives are saving energy optimizing plant design and conserving resources
its main environmental partners are identified at local level with their significance and impact on
products and services being analyzed to derive improvements monitored environmental parameters
include

   emissions
   energy consumption
   hazardous goods handling including waterpolluting agents such as acids and alkalis
   waste
   noise
   waste waterwater consumption

environmental protection measures taken at production level frequently exceed statutory requirements
 as confirmed by environmental certifications obtained in accordance with din en iso 14001
inprocess environmental protection resource conservation as well as extensive health and safety
measures are standard practice throughout the entire group production waste is sorted and wherever
possible recycled any further environmental impact is largely avoided by the use of exhaust gas
filters and collecting vessels and through the treatment and recycling of process liquids

the companys location in oelde was only recently awarded the tüv certificate in accordance with
din en iso 50001 for its exemplary energy management system to name but one example by
implementing such a system in line with the relevant german and european standards gea
consistently pursues the objective of enhancing energy efficiency at its own locations

the components of a systematic energy management system include the comprehensive analysis and
evaluation of inhouse energy fluxes based on which adequate technical and strategic measures for improving
the energy balance of an entity are formulated within the framework of integrated energy management the
objective pursued by this particular location was to achieve a continuous efficiency enhancement of at least
15 percent per year as well as a minimum 15 percent reduction in co2 emissions relative to the production
volume in this context cost savings are not only expected to come from the lower level of energy

      selected initiatives

      carbon disclosure project
      as in previous years gea group took part in the 2013 survey conducted within the framework of the
      carbon disclosure project cdp cdp is an independent notforprofit organization currently
      representing more than 700 institutional investors each year it gathers information on the greenhouse
      gas emissions of major listed corporations and their strategies to combat climate change the results
      are then made available to current and potential investors in this survey gea group also provided
      information on the opportunities and risks related to climate change as well as action taken in the
      field of climate protection from geas perspective any potential risks arising from a shift in demand
      will at the very least be offset by equally large opportunities to supply customers with energyefficient
      solutions for their production processes from our wide range of products

      as yet gea does not have a uniform groupwide system for measuring co2 emissions however co2
      emissions are measured in the segments on the basis of national and international standards such as
      iso 14001 or the co2 saver certificate

sustainable energy technology a total of nine companies from six eu member states are partners in the
coolsave project

enhanced fleet efficiency
a central fleet management software allows the centralized capture of key data such as mileage fuel
consumption as well as the related co2 emissions for each vehicle this system was first introduced in
germany where the largest share of the vehicle fleet is in operation this forms the basis for ecological
fleet management

stainability  for climate and customers
energy consumption is an increasingly important factor in the total cost of ownership of a machine or
plant gea believes that global climate change creates major potential for the use of its energyefficient
products

water is a key factor in the sustainability of geas products a large part of consolidated revenue is
generated by products that are related in some way to the careful management of this scarce resource
they range from resourceefficient filling technology that requires substantially less water for cleaning
aircooled condensers whose closedcircuit design prevents water loss efficient generator coolers
down to separators and decanters for drinking water production or sewage treatment plants

the following examples show the savings potential for a variety of resources that is provided by
machinery components systems and plants from gea group

resourceefficient cleaning of tanks and vessels
with its innovative cleaning technology gea offers its customers optimal solutions for various tank and
vessel cleaning applications besides achieving excellent cleaning results gea focuses on conserving
valuable resources in the cleaning process when developing new components and solutions

twister and tornado 4 extend the existing range of gea orbital cleaners as with typhoon tempest and
                                                    tornado twister and tornado 4 are liquiddriven
                                                    and work at the recommended pressure range of
                                                    between 4 and 10 bar due to its compact design the
                                                    twister can be fitted through insertion openings of
                                                    100mm diameter and larger which makes it the
                                                    smallest cleaner of the orbital range in contrast the
                                                    tornado 4 is the largest and most powerful amongst
                                                    all orbital cleaners both twister and tornado 4 are

      results in vessels with diameters of up to 33 m working pressure ranges between 05 and 90 bar with
      flow rates from 05 to 67 m³h the cleaning devices require a minimum amount of time and labor for
      purification purposes and stand out due to a renewed reduction in the consumption of energy water
      and cleaning agents

      excellent fuel at the push of a button
      in order to combat the problem of hazardous cat fines in fuel gea group is now offering a new system
      solution catfinemaster that was presented for the first time at the smm 2014 cat fines can
      significantly damage the engine and may even result in the total failure of the main engine under
                                               extreme circumstances thus fuel processing on board of
                                               vessels is of utmost importance and a task the new
                                               catfinemaster performs in an extremely efficient and
                                               reliable way the system consists of a separator as the core
                                               element and a feed pump that can be regulated in the
                                               process for ensuring an optimum adjustment of the flow of
                                               heavy oils to the respective process requirements this
                                               ensures additional efficiency gains while conserving energy
                                               at the same time our new generation of control systems
                                               that automatically controls the requested program at the
                                               press of a button as well as optimum measurement and
                                               analysis equipment round off the system

      the catfinemaster ensures an efficient reduction in cat fines which implies a target concentration of
      less than 5 ppm and the separation of all particles larger than 3 µm this makes the catfinemaster the
      very first system available in the market that ensures a maximum reduction in cat fines while
      guranteeing an optimum fuel composition

      efficient gas purification at low cost
      a new process developed by gea efficiently removes dust and nitric
      oxides from exhaust fumes released during the chemical production of
      commodities like glass and cement by employing catalytically activated
      filter elements compared to conventional filter systems this process
      significantly reduces both the capital expenditure and the operating
      expenses incurred in connection with the respective cleaning systems

      due to the fact that this process only embraces one process step the
      entire heat of the exhaust fumes emitted is utilized for the purpose of
      catalytic cleaning this is crucial to the high level of energy efficiency
      of the process

      in most cases todays industrial production is based on processes
      during which contaminated exhaust fumes are released into the
      environment in the wake of thermal processes all over the world
      regulations governing exhaust fumes and thus environmental
      pollution become stricter frequently this forces the industrial sector

to take many more additional gas purification measures in the past this was associated with huge
cleaning systems that purified exhaust fumes in various process steps by means of many different
components geas innovative process considerably facilitates the decision to employ an efficient gas
purification plant due to the lower level of overall costs and the high level of efficiency in this way
gea makes a contribution towards a more environmentally friendly industrial production

watercooled chillers with outstanding part load efficiency and small footprint
energy efficiency has become an increasingly important sales argument for this reason gea offers its
customers chillers that allow them to substantially reduce their power consumption and thus their
operating costs the new gea grasso blugenium shows the real savings potential of the refrigeration
process that may be unlocked

with the gea grasso blugenium gea has once again succeeded in developing a convincing and
energyefficient solution the new chiller  frequently called chilled water generator in airconditioning
applications  features a number of special design characteristics that materially differ from the
previous models in total they result in lower operating costs total cost of ownership and a higher
level of economic efficiency
the chillers of the new series are based on the proven piston compressors of the gea grasso v series
and characterized by a narrow width of only 12 m as well as a small footprint they are suitable for
                                                     industrial applications process cooling building
                                                     climate control and many additional areas
                                                     chillers are available in five model sizes with
                                                     maximum cooling ranging from 280 kw for the
                                                     smallest up to 1210 kw for the largest unit the
                                                     high level of efficiency of these models is
                                                     impressive and they do not only excel at full load
                                                     but also under part load conditions which are
                                                     frequently required this results in an unequalled
european seasonal energy efficiency ratio of 95 one of the features contributing to this performance
is the standard frequency inverter that enables speed control from 500 to 1500 rpm and thus infinitely
variable output matching over an extensive load range an additional efficiency characteristic is the
socalled electronic condenser drain system it monitors pressure conditions at the condenser and the
evaporator and assures optimal capacity utilization of the evaporator

the modest power consumption of gea grasso blugenium chillers also results from special design
characteristics like the low pressure drop as well as the effective temperature isolation between the
suction and discharge sides of the compressor which is mainly responsible for limiting the final
temperature the large suction chamber allows an unimpeded inflow of gas into the compression
chambers which results in only minor pressure drops at the compressor and benefits efficiency

gea grasso blugenium chillers are designed for long service lives and low lifecycle costs this is
reflected in some of the design features such as the welded crankcase of the compressors and the fully
welded heat exchangers for the condensers and evaporators in addition good insulation of the cold
part of the chillers minimizes corrosion risks

controlled entitiesnonmonetary contributions by venturers in contrast to ias 31 accounting for
joint arrangements under ifrs 11 depends not on the legal form of the arrangement but on the nature
of the rights and duties arising under the arrangement ifrs 11 makes a distinction between joint
operations and joint ventures joint operations are joint arrangements in which the parties with joint
control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to that arrangement in line
with this these parties account for their shares of the respective assets liabilities income and
expenditure as they did previously under ifrs 11 joint ventures now have to be accounted for using
the equity method the previous option to account for joint ventures using proportionate consolidation
has been removed

in fiscal year 2014 gea group applied the amended ias 39 financial instruments recognition and
measurement pursuant to the transition requirements initial application was retrospective as a
result of the amendments to ias 39 derivatives continue to be designated as hedging instruments in a
hedging relationship when the hedging instrument is novated to a central counterparty for this to
apply the central counterparty must become involved as a result of legal or regulatory requirements

the initial application of the amendments to ias 39 had no material effect on the consolidated
financial statements

ifric 21 levies  issued by the iasb in may 2013
this new interpretation provides more specific guidance on the general accounting principles for
liabilities to pay levies set out in ias 37 ifric 21 defines a levy as an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits that is imposed by governments payment of the levy is due to the unilateral obligation
resulting from the sovereign rights of the government payments attributable to contractual arrangements
between a government and an entity fines and penalties as well as payment obligations that are governed
by other standards such as ias 12 income taxes do not fall within the scope of ifric 21

ifric 21 is required to be applied retrospectively for fiscal years beginning on or after june 17 2014
initial application of the standard did not affect the consolidated financial statements

      ifrs 9 financial instruments issued by the iasb in july 2014
      the iasb issued ifrs 9 financial instruments in november 2009 completing the threephase project
      to replace ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement the new standard initially
      introduced uniform requirements on the measurement and classification of financial instruments
      ifrs 9 was reissued in october 2010 to incorporate new requirements on accounting for financial
      liabilities the requirements on accounting for financial liabilities and the derecognition of financial
      assets and liabilities were largely carried over unchanged from ias 39 the amendments to ifrs 9 and
      ifrs 7 published in december 2011 changed the mandatory effective date of ifrs 9 and modified the
      relief from restating comparative periods and the associated disclosures in ifrs 7 the version of
      ifrs 9 issued in november 2013 amended the standard to include a new general hedge accounting
      model in july 2014 the iasb issued the fourth and final version of ifrs 9 which now also includes
      the new requirements on the recognition of impairment losses and limited changes to the classification
      and measurement of financial assets the final version superseded all previous versions of ifrs 9

      the main new requirements of ifrs 9 on the recognition and measurement of financial instruments
      are described below

      classification and measurement of financial assets
      in the future there will only be two classification and measurement categories for financial assets at
      amortized cost or at fair value financial assets at amortized cost comprise those financial assets that
      give rise solely to payments of principal and interest at specified dates and are also held within a
      business model for managing financial assets whose objective is to hold those financial assets and
      collect the associated contractual cash flows all other financial assets are classified as at fair value
      under certain circumstances a fair value option is available for financial assets falling under the first
      category on initial recognition as at present

      depending on the business model in which they are held changes in financial assets belonging to the
      fair value category must be recognized in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income there is an
      optional right to measure certain equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive
      income in this case dividend income from these assets is recognized in profit or loss

                    notes to the consolidated financial statements  reporting principles




accounting for financial liabilities
with regard to accounting for financial liabilities the most important change relates to the presentation
of changes in value of financial liabilities measured at fair value in future the amount of the change
relating to changes in own credit risk must be recognized in other comprehensive income while the
remaining amount of the change in fair value is recognized in profit or loss

hedge accounting
the introduction of the new general hedge accounting model is intended to align hedge accounting
more closely with the risk management system the new model opens up further options to apply
hedge accounting in particular groups of hedged items that meet the qualifying criteria individually
as well as net positions and nil net positions may now be designated in a hedging relationship
generally every financial instrument carried at fair value is suitable to be a hedged item

new requirements are being introduced in relation to the effectiveness of hedging relationships
stipulation of the ranges for the measurement of effectiveness is being dispensed with so that a
retrospective effectiveness test no longer has to be performed the prospective effectiveness test as
well as recognition of any ineffectiveness continue to be required
a hedging relationship may only be terminated when the defined conditions for this are met this
means that it is mandatory to continue hedging relationships if risk management objectives remain
unchanged
enhanced disclosures are required in relation to the risk management strategy the effects of risk
management on future cash flows as well as the effects of hedge accounting on the financial statements

provided the conditions and qualitative characteristics continue to be met hedging relationships do
not have to be terminated as a result of the transition from ias 39 to ifrs 9 the existing requirements
under ias 39 may also as an option continue to be applied under ifrs 9

new impairment model
under the new model for determining impairment losses not only incurred losses but also expected
credit losses are recognized expected credit losses are required to be recognized either in the amount
of the 12month expected credit losses  the present value of the expected credit losses resulting from
the default events possible in the 12 months following the reporting date  or in the amount of the
lifetime expected credit losses the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses is required if the
credit risk of the financial instruments concerned has increased significantly since initial recognition

transition requirements
subject to endorsement by the eu ifrs 9 must be applied for fiscal years beginning on or after
january 1 2018 earlier application is permitted

                           notes to the consolidated financial statements  reporting principles




      ifrs 9 no longer requires restatement of priorperiod figures upon initial application of ifrs 9 when
      an entity chooses to apply this exemption additional disclosures are required under ifrs 7 to allow
      for assessment of the effects of the firsttime application of ifrs 9

      gea group is currently assessing what impact the application of ifrs 9 will have on the groups net
      assets financial position and results of operations

      ifrs 14 regulatory deferral accounts  issued by the iasb in january 2014
      there is currently no standard in ifrss that addresses the accounting for rateregulated activities if
      rate regulation leads to a situation where expenditure in the current fiscal year has an effect on the
      rates an entity may charge in future fiscal years this may result in economic benefits or disadvantages
      for the entity in some countries national gaap permits or requires that such economic benefits are
      capitalized or deferred

      the new standard aims to improve the comparability between financial statements of entities that
      engage in rateregulated activities ifrs 14 permits a firsttime adopter of ifrss to continue to present
      rateregulated activities in accordance with its previous gaap accounting policies applied on transition
      to ifrss however effects from the capitalization or deferral of economic advantages must then be
      reported separately as the iasb is currently carrying out a project on accounting for rateregulated
      activities ifrs 14 represents an interim solution subject to endorsement by the eu ifrs 14 must be
      applied by firsttime adopters of ifrss from january 1 2016 earlier application is permitted the new
      requirements are not expected to affect the consolidated financial statements since application of
      ifrs 14 is mandatory only for firsttime adopters of ifrss

      ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers  issued by the iasb in may 2014
      the new standard pools the existing revenue recognition requirements and establishes a single
      revenue recognition model ifrs 15 applies to the recognition of contracts with customers for the
      provision of services and the sale of goods and thus also covers the recognition of construction
      contracts which were previously governed by ias 11

      the new integrated revenue recognition model provides a fivestep framework for determining the
      amount of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition

      1 identification of the contract with the customer
      2 identification of separate performance obligations
      3 determination of the total transaction price
      4 allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations
      5 recognition of revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied

      a performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied when control over the goods sold or services
      provided is transferred to the customer the accounting treatment differs depending on whether
      control passes at a point in time or over time if control is transferred to the customer over time
      revenue is recognized based on the stage of completion provided this can be reasonably measured

      gea group is currently assessing the impact of the new requirements at present gea group does not
      believe that the new requirements will have a significant impact on the groups net assets financial position
      and results of operations however the timing of revenue recognition may change for certain orders

      in addition ifrs 15 introduces extensive disclosures on revenue recognition

                     notes to the consolidated financial statements  reporting principles




subject to endorsement by the eu ifrs 15 must be applied for fiscal years beginning on or after
january 1 2017 earlier application of the requirements is permitted initial application is retrospective
with certain practical expedients permitted under ifrs 15

amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28  sale or contribution of assets between an investor
and its associate or joint venture  issued by the iasb in september 2014
the amendments address a known inconsistency between the requirements of ifrs 10 and those of
ias 28 2011 in cases where assets are sold to or contributed by an associate or a joint venture in the
future the gain or loss resulting from such a transaction will only be recognized in full if the asset sold
or contributed is a business within the meaning of ifrs 3 regardless of whether the transaction is
structured as a share deal or an asset deal however if the assets do not constitute a business any gain
or loss is recognized only in proportion to the investors interest in the associate or joint venture

gea group does not expect the implementation of the amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28 to materially
affect its financial reporting

subject to their endorsement by the eu which is still outstanding the amendments must be applied
for fiscal years beginning on or after january 1 2016 earlier adoption is permitted once they have been
endorsed by the eu

ias 1 presentation of financial statements  disclosure initiative  issued by the iasb in
december 2014
the amendments are attributable to an iasb initiative to improve the presentation and disclosure
requirements in existing standards they clarify that disclosures are generally only required if their
content is not immaterial in addition they clarify how shares in the other comprehensive income of
equityaccounted companies should be presented in the statement of comprehensive income the
amendments also extend the requirements on the aggregation and disaggregation of line items in the
balance sheet and statement of comprehensive income lastly they ease the rigid requirements
regarding the structure of the notes so that these can now be structured in a way that takes better
account of their relevance for the individual company

gea group does not expect the implementation of the amendments to ias 1 to materially affect its
financial reporting

subject to their endorsement by the eu which is still outstanding the amendments will be required to
be applied for the first time in fiscal years beginning on or after january 1 2016 earlier application is
permitted

      amendments to ias 19 employee benefits  defined benefit plans employee
      contributions  issued by the iasb in november 2013
      the amendments concern requirements relating to contributions from employees or third parties that
      are linked to service and clarify the corresponding requirements for attributing such contributions to
      periods of service in addition the accounting for contributions that are independent of the number of
      years of service has been simplified

      gea group does not expect the implementation of the amendments to ias 19 to materially affect its
      financial reporting

      the amendments will be required to be applied retrospectively for the first time in fiscal years
      beginning on or after february 1 2015 earlier application is permitted

      improvements to ifrss 2012 and improvements to ifrss 2013  amendments under the

2            accounting policies
21           description of accounting policies

basis of consolidation
gea groups consolidated financial statements include all significant companies that gea group
directly or indirectly holds the majority of voting rights or otherwise directly or indirectly controls by
holding for example based on contractual arrangements control exists when gea group is exposed
or has rights to variable returns from involvement with the investee on the one hand and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee on the other subsidiaries are
consolidated from the date on which the group obtains control over them they are deconsolidated
from the date on which control is lost

acquired subsidiaries are accounted for using the purchase method the consideration paid is
measured on the basis of the fair value of the assets received the liabilities assumed to the seller and
the equity instruments issued at the transaction date the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
and contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are recognized at their fair value at the
transaction date irrespective of any noncontrolling interests any contingent consideration agreed is
recognized at fair value at the acquisition date subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in
profit or loss

the excess of cost over the share of the fair value of the subsidiarys net assets acquired is recognized
as goodwill if after a further examination cost is lower than the share of the fair value of the
subsidiarys acquired net assets measured at fair value the difference is recognized as a gain in profit
or loss

intragroup receivables liabilities income and expenses are eliminated as are cash flows and profits
and losses from intragroup transactions

if consolidated subsidiaries have a different reporting date to the parent they are included on the basis
of interim financial statements as of december 31 2014

                           notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




      a total of 51 subsidiaries previous year 70 were not consolidated since their effect on the groups net
      assets financial position and results of operations is not material even when viewed in the aggregate
      their consolidated revenue amounts to 02 percent previous year 02 percent of the groups aggregate
      consolidated revenue while their earnings account for 11 percent previous year 16 percent of
      recognized earnings before tax of the complete group and their equity accounts for 10 percent
      previous year 14 percent of consolidated equity the subsidiaries are measured at cost and recognized
      as noncurrent other financial assets as their fair value cannot be determined with sufficient certainty

      a complete list of all subsidiaries associates and joint ventures can be found in section 124

      changes in ownership interest
      changes in gea groups ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are
      equity transactions the carrying amounts of controlling and noncontrolling interests must be adjusted
      in such way that they reflect the changes in ownership interests in the subsidiaries any difference
      between the amount by which the noncontrolling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the
      consideration paid or received must be recognized directly in equity and attributed to the owners of
      gea group

      investments in associates and joint ventures
      entities over which a group company can exercise significant influence ie it can participate in the
      investees financial and operating policy decisions are accounted for as associates this generally relates
      to companies in which gea group directly or indirectly holds 20 to 50 percent of the voting rights

      joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the parties involved have joint control over the
      arrangement and rights to its net assets joint control exists when decisions about the relevant activities
      of the joint arrangement require the unanimous consent of gea group and the other parties that
      collectively control the arrangement

      associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method at the groups share of
      adjusted equity they are initially recognized at cost any goodwill arising on acquisition is included in
      the carrying amount of the investment

      the groups share of the profit or loss of equityaccounted investments is recognized and presented
      separately in the income statement the groups share of income and expenses recognized outside
      profit or loss is reported directly in other comprehensive income if the groups share of an associates
      or joint ventures loss exceeds the carrying amount of the net investment in the associate or joint
      venture no further losses are recognized

      where necessary the accounting policies of associates and joint ventures are adjusted to comply with
      uniform group accounting principles
      as of the reporting date two investments in associates previous year two and six investments in
      joint ventures previous year 13 were accounted for using the equity method

      joint operations
      joint operations are joint arrangements whereby the parties involved have joint control over the
      arrangement and rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement

                    notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




joint control exists when decisions about the relevant activities of the joint arrangement require the
unanimous consent of gea group and the other parties that collectively control the arrangement

the assets liabilities income and expenses of joint operations are accounted for in proportion to gea
groups interest in them in accordance with the relevant ifrss

currency translation
the group companies prepare their annual financial statements on the basis of their respective
functional currencies

foreign currency transactions entered into by companies included in the consolidated financial
statements are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction
date monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the applicable exchange rate at each reporting
date the exchange rate gains and losses resulting from these items are generally reported in the
income statement under other income or expenses

all financial statements of companies whose functional currencies differ from the reporting currency
are translated into the reporting currency used in gea groups consolidated financial statements the
assets and liabilities of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are translated
at the middle rates prevailing at the reporting date the income statements of these companies are
translated at the average rates for the period under review if these average rates are not a reasonable
approximation of the actual transaction rates the income statements are translated at the relevant
transaction rates any translation differences are reported in equity under other comprehensive
income and adjusted

goodwill from the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries is translated at the closing rate as an asset
attributable to these companies

property plant and equipment
items of property plant and equipment are depreciated at cost less cumulative depreciation and
impairment losses plus reversals of impairment losses

expenses for major regular maintenance are amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset
concerned or over the period to the next maintenance date

the carrying amount of items of property plant and equipment is reviewed if it is likely to have been
impaired by events or changes in circumstances an impairment test is performed by comparing the
assets carrying amount with its recoverable amount the recoverable amount is defined as the higher
of internal value in use and fair value less costs to sell net realizable value fair value is primarily
determined on the basis of the current local market price for used machinery or commercial real estate
if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognized to assess
impairment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which separate cash flows can be identified if
the reason for the impairment subsequently ceases to apply the impairment loss is reversed up to a
maximum of historical cost net of accumulated depreciation

      leases
      leases are agreements that grant the right to use an asset for a defined period in return for a payment
      leases are accounted for as finance leases if substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to using
      the leased asset and therefore beneficial ownership are attributable to the lessee as a result the
      gea group companies that as lessees bear substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the
      leased asset recognize the asset at the lower of fair value or the present value of minimum lease
      payments and depreciate the asset in subsequent periods over the shorter of the lease term or the
      assets estimated useful life a corresponding liability is recognized which is amortized in the
      following periods using the effective interest method payments to the lessor are divided into an
      interest and a principal repayment element with the interest element being recognized in profit or
      loss over the lease term as a continuous interest payment on the residual lease liability all other leases
      under which gea group is a lessee are treated as operating leases in these cases the lease payments
      are recognized as an expense using the straightline method

      lease transactions under which gea group companies are the lessor and substantially all the risks and
      rewards associated with the leased asset are transferred to the lessee are accounted for as sales and
      financing business a receivable is reported in the amount of the net investment under the lease the
      interest income subsequently generated is recognized in profit or loss all other lease transactions
      under which the group is the lessor are treated as operating leases in this case the asset leased for use
      remains on the balance sheet and is depreciated the lease payments are recognized as income using
      the straightline method over the term of the lease

      various companies included in the consolidated financial statements have sold and leased back items
      of property plant and equipment in the past depending on the allocation of risk these sale and
      leaseback transactions resulted in a finance lease or an operating lease in the case of operating leases
      the entire gain was recognized immediately if the asset was sold at fair value if the asset was sold
      above its fair value the difference between the selling price and fair value was deferred and recognized
      over the lease term

      investment property
      property that is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation is reported as investment property in
      the case of property that is held partly to earn rentals and partly to produce or supply goods or services
      or for administrative purposes the entire property is classified as investment property if the own use
      proportion is insignificant this is assumed to be the case if the proportion is below 10 percent

      cost is depreciated using the straightline method over a period of between 10 and 50 years the same
      measurement method is applied as for property plant and equipment

goodwill
goodwill arising from business combinations is recognized as an intangible asset

goodwill is tested for impairment at segment level at least once a year at the end of the fiscal year and
if there are any indications of impairment the recoverable amount of a segment is compared with the
carrying amount including goodwill the recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of internal
value in use and fair value less costs to sell fair value less costs to sell is the measure for the impairment
of business units classified as held for sale if the carrying amount of the segments assets exceeds the
recoverable amount an impairment loss in the amount of the difference is recognized in profit or loss

an impairment loss initially reduces the carrying amount of goodwill any amount exceeding goodwill
is allocated proportionately to the carrying amounts of noncurrent nonfinancial assets

the value in use of the business units classified as continuing operations is calculated annually at the
end of the fiscal year using the discounted cash flow method it is only necessary to estimate a selling
price for the business units classified as continuing operations if the value in use is less than the
carrying amount

other intangible assets
other intangible assets include both internally generated and purchased assets internally generated
intangible assets comprise capitalized development costs in addition to contractbased rights
purchased intangible assets mainly contain technologies brand names and customer relationships
technologies brand names and customer relationships are usually acquired in connection with
takeovers internally generated and purchased intangible assets are recognized at cost

if the useful life of an intangible asset can be determined the asset is amortized on a straightline basis
over its useful life intangible assets whose useful life cannot be determined are recognized at cost

the carrying amount of an intangible asset is reviewed if it is likely to have been impaired by events
or changes in circumstances intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment
at least once a year this requires the recoverable amount of the assets to be determined the
recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of internal value in use and fair value less costs to sell
if the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount the asset is written down to the
recoverable amount previously recognized impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the
impairment no longer apply impairment losses are reversed up to a maximum of the amortized
historical cost

indefinitelived intangible assets are also examined each year to determine whether the classification
of the asset as indefinitelived can be retained any change to a finite useful life is applied prospectively

other financial assets
other financial assets include investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other equity investments
other securities financial receivables except trade receivables and derivative financial instruments




                                        gea group annual report 2014                                              139

                           notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




      shares in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other equity investments are allocated to the availablefor
      sale financial assets measurement category they are measured at cost because the shares in these
      corporations are not traded in an active market and their fair value cannot be reliably measured this
      is due to the significant margin of fluctuation for fair value measurement the probabilities of the
      various estimates cannot be reliably determined within the margin of fluctuation a reliable fair value
      can only be determined during sale negotiations the group does not intend to sell these financial
      assets

      securitized debt instruments that are intended to be held to maturity are allocated to the heldto
      maturity investments measurement category and measured accordingly at amortized cost using the
      effective interest method all other securities are measured at fair value and any fluctuations in value
      are recognized directly in other comprehensive income

      financial receivables are allocated to the loans and receivables measurement category and measured
      at amortized cost using the effective interest method

      derivative financial instruments are used exclusively for hedging purposes in particular to hedge
      currency risk and to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations resulting from financing transactions
      they are always carried at fair value if derivative financial instruments are not included in a
      documented hedging relationship they are allocated to the financial assets at fair value through profit
      or loss measurement category and their fair value changes are recognized in the income statement if
      the derivative financial instruments included in a recognized hedging relationship are used to hedge
      future cash flows the fair value fluctuations are recognized in other comprehensive income

      embedded financial derivatives are separated from their host contracts if certain qualifying criteria
      relating to their recognition and measurement are met

      financial assets are recognized as soon as gea group has received a cash payment or it has the right to
      receive cash flows in the case of regular way purchases of nonderivative financial assets the settlement
      date ie the delivery date of the financial assets is decisive assets are derecognized as soon as the
      right to receive cash payments or other financial assets expires as a result of payment waiver statutory
      limitation offsetting or any other factor or the right is transferred to another person with the risks
      passing in full to the purchaser in the case of regular way sales of nonderivative financial assets the
      settlement date is taken to be the date of derecognition in line with the principle used for recognition

      items are originally recognized at fair value or in the case of financial assets not measured at fair
      value including directly attributable transaction costs

      financial assets or groups of financial assets are tested for indications of impairment at each reporting
      date impairment losses are recognized in the income statement financial assets are impaired if
      following one or more events that occurred after initial recognition of the asset there is objective
      evidence that the expected future cash flows have declined objective evidence of impairment may be

                     notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




for example significant financial difficulties of the debtor or payment default in the case of financial
assets measured at amortized cost eg unquoted equity instruments the impairment loss corresponds
to the difference between the carrying amount of the financial instrument and the present value of the
future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate

if the reasons for impairment no longer apply impairment losses on financial assets  with the
exception of equity instruments  are reversed to income up to the amount of the amortized cost that
would have applied if no impairment loss had been charged

recognized hedging relationships hedge accounting
at the time they are entered into derivative financial instruments that are included in a recognized
hedging relationship are designated either as a hedge against changes in the fair value of assets
liabilities or firm commitments fair value hedge or as a hedge of future cash flows in connection
with assets and liabilities cash flow hedge

in the case of an effective hedge of the risk of a change in fair value the change in the fair value of both
the derivative and the hedged item is recognized in the income statement changes in fair value offset
each other in a perfect hedge

if derivatives are used to hedge future cash flows the effective portion of the change in the derivatives
fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income the ineffective portion of the change in fair
value is reported as a gain or loss the item recognized in other comprehensive income arising from
the effective portion of the change in fair value is recognized in the income statement as soon as the
hedged item is settled if settlement of the hedged item leads to the recognition of a nonfinancial asset
the changes in value previously recognized in other comprehensive income are offset against the cost
of the nonfinancial asset if contrary to previous assumptions the hedged transaction is not executed
the changes in value previously recognized in equity are reversed directly to profit or loss

the group predominantly uses cash flow hedges to hedge foreign currency and interest rate risk
gea group also enters into hedging transactions in accordance with its risk management principles
that offer economic hedges of existing risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements
of ias 39 currency forwards that are used to hedge currency risk arising from monetary assets and
liabilities are not aggregated into a recognized hedging relationship effects arising from the translation
of balance sheet items that are recognized in the income statement are largely offset by changes in the
fair values of currency forwards that are also recognized in the income statement

gea group does not currently apply hedge accounting for fair value hedges

deferred taxes
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences between the carrying
amounts in the respective national tax accounts and those in the ifrs financial statements that are
included in the consolidated financial statements deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax loss




                                        gea group annual report 2014                                            141

                           notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




      carryforwards deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss
      carryforwards are recognized only to the extent that there is likely to be sufficient taxable income
      available in future

      deferred tax liabilities are not recognized on taxable temporary differences arising from investments
      in subsidiaries associates or joint ventures as long as the reversal of temporary differences is unlikely
      in the foreseeable future

      inventories
      inventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value acquisition cost is calculated
      at average cost or using the firstin firstout fifo method production cost includes direct costs plus
      materials and production overheads depreciation and productionrelated administrative costs net
      realizable value is calculated as the estimated sale proceeds less costs incurred until completion and
      selling expenses previously recognized impairment losses must be reversed if the reasons for the
      impairment no longer apply impairment losses are reversed up to a maximum of the amortized
      historical cost

      trade receivables
      trade receivables include no interest component and are recognized in the balance sheet at their
      principal amount less appropriate allowances for bad debts

      trade receivables that are sold to financial services companies under factoring agreements are
      derecognized once substantially all the risks and rewards have been transferred to the financial
      services company

      construction contracts
      receivables and revenues from construction contracts are recognized using the percentage of
      completion poc method

      the percentage of completion is determined using the costtocost method which is derived from the
      ratio of contract costs incurred to the total estimated contract costs contracts are measured at
      production cost plus a profit in proportion to the stage of completion losses on construction contracts
      are immediately recognized in full in the fiscal year in which they are identified regardless of the stage
      of completion if the contract costs incurred and the gains or losses recognized exceed the progress
      billings the excess amount is capitalized and reported under trade receivables if the progress
      payments received exceed the capitalized costs and recognized gains or losses at the reporting date
      they are reported as a liability under other liabilities advance payments on construction contracts
      are reported separately as a liability

      if the contract margin cannot be estimated reliably revenue is recognized only in the amount of the
      contract costs incurred zeroprofit method a profit is only recognized once the contract margin can
      be estimated reliably

      payments for differences in the overall contract claims and premiums are included in the contract
      revenue insofar as these will probably result in revenue that is capable of being estimated reliably

cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash demand deposits and financial assets that can be converted
into cash at any time and that are subject to only slight fluctuations in value they are recognized at
fair value

assets held for sale liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations
noncurrent assets or groups of assets classified as held for sale within the meaning of ifrs 5 are
recognized at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell classification as held for
sale is made when the carrying amount of a noncurrent asset or disposal group will be recovered
principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and the criteria defined in
ifrs 5 have been met overall the corresponding assets as well as the liabilities of a disposal group are
reported separately in the balance sheet as assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale on initial
classification as held for sale noncurrent assets or assets and liabilities of disposal groups are first
measured in accordance with the applicable ifrss they are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell with disposal groups being measured as a whole as the
carrying amount of heldforsale depreciable assets is principally realized by the disposal rather than
the use of these assets they are no longer depreciated once they have been reclassified

if a disposal group represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation it
qualifies as a discontinued operation the results of discontinued operations are reported separately in
the income statement as profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations in addition the prior
year comparatives are adjusted in the income statement so that the results of these operations are also
reported under discontinued operations cash flows from discontinued operations are reported
separately in the cash flow statement in this case as well the prioryear comparatives are adjusted
accordingly revenue and expenditures from intragroup transactions are taken into account when
presenting results from discontinued operations if they will continue to arise after the disposal of a
discontinued operation

as a general principle the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements relate to the
assets or liabilities recognized in the corresponding line items and to continuing operations where
disclosures relate to gea group including assets held for sale as well as the associated liabilities and
discontinued operations this is indicated either by a statement that the disclosures refer to the
complete group or by another comment

subscribed capital
ordinary shares are classified as equity treasury shares are deducted from the equity attributable to
the shareholders of gea group aktiengesellschaft

      obligations under pension plans
      obligations under pension plans relate to postemployment benefit obligations defined benefit
      obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method the present value of these obligations
      reflects expected future salary and pension trends since the entitlements earnable in the period up to
      the retirement age depend on these claims under supplementary healthcare benefit insurance are
      included in the actuarial measurement of assumptions made in respect of healthcare cost trends the
      pension obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial reports by independent actuaries

      in order to provide these pension benefits the company in some cases holds financial assets in long
      term funds outside gea group and qualifying insurance policies insofar as the entitlements are
      funded by such external assets plan assets their fair value is offset against the present value of the
      defined benefit obligation the resulting balance is reported under noncurrent employee benefit
      obligations or other noncurrent financial assets net carrying amount

      actuarial gains and losses from the remeasurement of the net carrying amount are recognized in other
      comprehensive income in the year in which they arise and reported in retained earnings after
      adjustment for tax effects this also applies to the recognition of the difference between the actual
      returns on plan assets and the returns calculated using the discount factor costs from unwinding the
      discount on the net carrying amount are recognized in interest expenses income is recognized in
      interest income current and past service cost for the period as well as gains and losses from
      settlements are recognized in the relevant function costs

      other employee benefit obligations
      other employee benefit obligations comprise other longterm benefits and all shortterm benefits
      shortterm employee benefit obligations are expected to be settled in full no more than 12 months after
      completion of the service rendered they include wages salaries social insurance contributions paid
      vacation and profitsharing arrangements they are recognized as an expense at the same time as the
      work is remunerated any expenditure in excess of the payments already made is reported as a deferred
      liability at the reporting date other longterm employee benefits such as jubilee payments or partial
      retirement arrangements are recognized at the actuarial present value of the obligation at the reporting
      date securities are pledged to the beneficiaries to protect vested partial retirement credits against the
      employers insolvency the fair value of these securities is offset against the corresponding liability

      provisions
      provisions for uncertain liabilities are recognized where there is a legal or constructive obligation to a
      third party a future outflow of resources is likely and the expected settlement value can be estimated
      reliably the present value of the settlement amount is recognized if the time value of money is

                     notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




material amounts are discounted at the market rates for the appropriate maturity and currency
discount unwinding costs are reported in interest expense

the cost at the time when reserve is recognized is reported in cost of sales when warranty of provisions
are recognized in all other cases provisions are recognized when the product is accepted the
provision is measured on the basis of both the warranty cost actually incurred in the past and on the
evaluated overall risk inherent in the system or product provisions are also recognized if a claim is
made under a warranty and a loss is likely recourse claims against suppliers are capitalized if their
services are subject to a warranty and it is highly likely that the claim can be enforced

provisions for expected losses from onerous contracts are recognized if the unavoidable costs of
meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under
it the unavoidable costs also include the unavoidable overheads needed to meet the obligations

financial liabilities
financial liabilities comprise bonds liabilities to banks and liabilities under finance leases they are
initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs they are subsequently measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method liabilities under finance leases are initially measured at the
lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of minimum lease payments

other liabilities
the recognition and subsequent measurement of other liabilities is the same as for financial liabilities
with the exception of advance payments and the gross amount due to customers for contract work
advance payments are stated at their principal amount please see the information provided on the
recognition of construction contracts for the measurement of the gross amount due to customers for
contract work

trade payables
trade payables also include liabilities for goods received or services rendered that have not yet been
invoiced as there is only slight uncertainty as to the amount of the liability trade payables are recognized
at fair value this corresponds to the settlement amount in the case of liabilities due within one year

revenue recognition
revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of
the goods sold are transferred to the customer this normally occurs when the goods are handed over
to the customer revenue from services is recognized when the service is rendered revenue is
measured at the fair value of the consideration received or to be received customer bonuses discounts
or rebates reduce the amount of revenue recognized




                                        gea group annual report 2014                                             145

                           notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




      revenue from construction contracts is generally recognized using the percentage of completion
      method under which revenue is recognized in accordance with the stage of completion the stage of
      completion is determined using the ratio of contract costs incurred as of the reporting date to the total
      estimated contract costs as of the reporting date costtocost method contract costs include direct
      costs plus materials and construction overheads depreciation productionrelated administrative
      costs and such other costs that are specifically chargeable to the customer under the terms of the
      contract where a construction contract is performed over a long period and where the contract is
      largely financed by gea group contract costs also include directly attributable borrowing costs
      conversely income from the investment of advance payments received is offset against contract costs
      where this has a material influence on the contract margin adjustments are made for variations in
      contract work claims and incentive payments insofar as these will probably result in revenue that is
      capable of being reliably estimated

      in line with the percentage of completion method construction contracts are measured as the contract
      costs incurred as of the reporting date plus the profit attributable to the proportion of work completed
      revenue recognized is reported under trade payables less progress billings if the outcome of a
      construction contract cannot be reliably estimated the probable recoverable revenue is recognized up
      to the amount of the costs incurred contract costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which
      they are incurred if it is foreseeable that the total contract costs will exceed the contract revenue the
      expected loss is recognized immediately as an expense

      interest income is recognized ratably over the remaining maturity based on the effective interest rate
      and the amount of the remaining receivable dividend income on equity instruments is recognized if
      the right to receive payment is based on legally assertable claims

      revenue from royalties is recognized in the period in which it arises in accordance with the underlying
      contracts

      sharebased payment
      gea group has a sharebased payment program under which selected managers are granted
      performance shares the fair value of these rights is calculated at the grant date and allocated as an
      expense over the vesting period using the straightline method a corresponding provision is
      recognized the provision is remeasured at each reporting date and at the payment date furthermore
      in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 part of the bonuses earned by executive board members was converted
      into phantom shares the entitlement from phantom shares is measured at the current share price at
      the reporting date in fiscal year 2012 a longterm share price component was introduced as part of the
      revision of the variable remuneration system for executive board members payment from this
      remuneration component is dependent on the performance of gea shares compared with a benchmark
      index the entitlement from the longterm share price component is measured at fair value at the
      reporting date changes in the fair value of the provision for sharebased payment programs are
      recognized as interest expense or income see section 634

      in addition one group company grants its employees options on shares of the company via a trustee
      the cost of this sharebased payment is estimated at the grant date and amortized using the straight
      line method up to the exercise date see section 61

research and development
research expenditures are recognized immediately as an expense development costs that are designed
to significantly enhance a product or process are capitalized if completion of the product or process is
technically and economically feasible the development is marketable the expenditures can be measured
reliably and adequate resources are available to complete the development project all other development
expenditures are recognized immediately as expenses capitalized development expenditures for
completed projects are reported at cost less cumulative amortization and impairment losses capitalized
development costs for intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment once a year

development costs that are required under construction contracts are capitalized as part of the cost of
the asset

government grants
government grants are recognized at fair value provided that the group meets the conditions necessary
to receive the grant government grants to cover expenses are recognized over the period in which the
costs for which the grants were awarded are incurred government grants for capital expenditure are
deducted from the cost of purchasing the corresponding asset

22      estimates and management judgment
preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and exercise
judgment that may affect the companys assets liabilities provisions and deferred tax assets and
liabilities as well as its income and expenses and contingent liabilities

factors that may cause amounts to fall below estimates might include a deterioration in the global
economy movements in exchange rates and interest rates as well as material litigation and changes in
environmental or other legislation production errors the loss of key customers and rising borrowing
costs may also adversely affect the groups future performance

the recognition and measurement of the following assets and liabilities are in some cases based on
management judgment all assumptions represent the best of managements knowledge and belief in
order to convey a true and fair view of the companys net assets financial position and results of
operations if actual circumstances subsequently differ from those forecast this will affect the
recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities depending on the item concerned earnings
may also be affected

basis of consolidation
management judgment was applied in defining the basis of consolidation see section 21 particularly
with regard to assessing which subsidiaries to exclude from the consolidated financial statements on
the basis of materiality

acquisitions
goodwill is reported in the balance sheet as a result of acquisitions when an acquired company is
initially consolidated all its identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognized at
their acquisitiondate fair value a basic problem is estimating these fair values as a rule land and

                            notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




      buildings are measured on the basis of independent appraisals if intangible assets are identified their
      fair values are calculated using an appropriate measurement method these measurements are made
      on the basis of assumptions by management with respect to the future value of the relevant assets and
      the discount rate obligations for contingent consideration are recognized on the basis of the current
      planning

      goodwill
      the group tests goodwill for impairment annually the recoverable amounts calculated for this
      purpose for segments classified as continuing operations are determined based on value in use value
      in use is calculated using assumptions by management see section 53

      taxes
      gea group operates in a large number of countries and is therefore subject to different tax jurisdictions
      calculating tax liabilities requires management to make various estimates management believes that
      it has made a reasonable estimate of tax uncertainties however no assurance can be given that the
      actual outcome of these uncertainties will correspond to the estimates made any deviations may have
      an impact on the level of tax liabilities or deferred taxes in the year of the decision

      when assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets management judges the extent to which
      realization of the deferred tax assets is sufficiently likely the question of whether the deferred tax
      assets can actually be realized depends on whether sufficient future taxable income can be generated
      against which the temporary differences or tax loss carryforwards can be offset management therefore
      analyzes the times at which the deferred tax liabilities reverse and expected future taxable income
      management forecasts whether deferred tax assets can be realized on the basis of expected future
      taxable income deferred tax assets decline if the estimate of planned taxable income decreases if tax
      benefits available as a result of tax strategies are reduced or the amount or timing of future tax benefits
      is restricted by changes in the law see section 77

      measurement of assets held for sale liabilities associated with assets held for sale and classification
      of operations as discontinued
      assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and
      fair value less costs to sell assumptions by management are taken into account when determining fair
      value less costs to sell the classification as held for sale or the classification of activities as attributable
      to discontinued operations also require estimates by management these estimates relate in particular
      to the question of whether the carrying amount of a noncurrent asset or a disposal group will be
      recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and whether the
      criteria set out under ifrs 5 have been met overall

                    notes to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies




provisions and contingent liabilities
changes in estimates of the probability of a present obligation or of an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits could mean that items previously classified as contingent liabilities must be reported
as provisions or that the amount of provisions must be adjusted see section 62 this also applies in
particular to environmental obligations

obligations under pension plans
the present value of pension obligations depends on actuarial assumptions these assumptions
comprise discount rates expected wage and salary increases as well as the pension increase rate and
mortality rates these assumptions could differ significantly from actual future outcomes as a result of
changes in market and economic conditions and could therefore have a material effect on the level of
the obligation and the related expenses

the discount rate used to measure the net carrying amount is calculated at the end of each year this is
the rate used to calculate the present value of future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the
obligation in order to calculate the discount rate the group uses the interest rate on highquality
corporate bonds denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are paid and whose terms to
maturity correspond to those of the pension obligations

other significant assumptions relating to pension obligations are partly based on market conditions
see section 631

construction contracts
the recognition of construction contracts using the percentage of completion method is based on
managements estimates of the cost of such contracts changes in estimates or differences between the
estimated cost and the actual cost have a direct effect on recognized earnings from construction
contracts the operating units continuously review the estimates and adjust them if required

litigation
in some cases gea group companies are parties to litigation the outcome of this litigation could have

regularly analyzes current information on these legal disputes and recognizes provisions for probable
obligations including estimated legal costs both internal counsel and external lawyers are used to
make this assessment when deciding on the need to recognize provisions management takes into
account the probability of an unfavorable outcome and its ability to estimate the amount of the
obligation with sufficient reliability the filing of a suit or the formal assertion of a claim against a
gea group company does not necessarily mean that a provision must be recognized for the related
risk see section 84

      3       financial risk management
      the executive board has put in place an effective set of guidelines to manage and hence largely limit
      or hedge financial risks throughout the group the objectives with regard to protecting assets
      eliminating gaps in security and improving efficiency in identifying and analyzing risks are clearly
      defined as are the relevant organizational structures powers and responsibilities the guidelines are
      based on the principles of system security the separation of functions transparency and immediate
      documentation

      for further information please see the discussion of the risk management system in the management
      report

      because it operates worldwide gea group is exposed to currency interest rate commodity price
      credit and liquidity risk in the course of its ordinary activities financial risk management aims to
      reduce this risk through the appropriate use of derivative and nonderivative hedging instruments

      currency risk
      because gea group operates internationally its cash flows are denominated not only in euros but also
      in a number of other currencies particularly us dollars hedging the resulting currency risk is a key
      element of risk management

      the group guideline requires all group companies to hedge foreign currency items as they arise in
      order to fix prices on the basis of hedging rates currency risks are hedged for recognized hedged
      items unrecognized firm commitments and highly probable transactions the hedging periods are
      determined by the maturity of the hedged items and are usually up to 12 months but in exceptional
      cases may exceed that period significantly despite the hedging requirement changes in exchange
      rates may affect sales opportunities outside the eurozone

      group companies based in the eurozone are obliged to tender to gea groups central finance unit all
      outstanding exposures relating to transactions in goods and services in major transaction currencies
      most of these exposures are passed on directly to banks at matching maturities depending on the
      hedging objective of the derivatives and the related accounting treatment they may also be hedged as
      part of a portfolio the hedging of financial transactions and transactions conducted by subsidiaries
      outside the eurozone is also closely coordinated with the central finance unit

      interest rate risk
      because gea group operates worldwide liquidity is raised and invested in the international money
      and capital markets in different currencies but mainly in euros and at different maturities the
      resulting financial liabilities and investments are exposed to interest rate risk which must be assessed
      and managed by central financial management derivative financial instruments may be used on a
      casebycase basis to hedge interest rate risk and reduce the interest rate volatility and financing costs
      of the hedged items only the central finance unit is permitted to enter into such interest rate hedges

                  notes to the consolidated financial statements  financial risk management




all interest rate derivatives are allocated to individual loans the hedging relationships are documented
and recognized as cash flow hedges overall the interest expense from the loans and the allocated
derivatives reported in the income statement reflects the fixed interest rate for the hedging relationship

crosscurrency swaps were used in connection with the financing of acquisitions in canada and the
uk they are recognized at fair value however they are not included in any documented hedging
relationship with intragroup hedged items the earnings effects arising from changes to currency
parities that have occurred since the beginning of the crosscurrency swaps and the earnings effects
due to the related intragroup receivables do not match due to different calculation bases forward rate
relative to spot rate the difference in value amounted to eur 270 thousand in fiscal year 2014
previous year eur 653 thousand

commodity price risk
gea group requires various metals such as aluminum copper and steel whose purchase prices can be
subject to substantial fluctuations depending on the market situation longterm supply agreements
have been entered into with various suppliers in order to hedge commodity price risk

credit risk
financial instruments are exposed to credit risk in that the other party to the contract may fail to fulfill
its obligations the counterparty limit system used by gea group for financial management aims to
continuously assess and manage counterparty default risk a maximum risk limit has been defined for
each counterparty which in most cases is derived from the ratings from recognized credit rating
agencies and credit default swaps cdss appropriate action is taken if the individual limit is exceeded
the financial standing of potential customers is ascertained before orders are accepted using an
internal risk board procedure active receivables management including nonrecourse factoring and
credit insurance is also performed in the case of export transactions confirmed and unconfirmed
letters of credit are used alongside sureties guarantees and cover notes including from export credit
agencies such as euler hermes in addition to local monitoring by the subsidiary in question gea
group oversees the main credit risks at group management level so that any accumulation of risk can
be better managed

since trade receivables are usually due from a large number of customers in different sectors and
regions there is no concentration of risk valuation allowances take account of specific credit risks

so as to reduce the credit risk involved derivative financial instruments are only entered into with
reputable financial institutions

the maximum exposure for the financial assets is limited to their carrying amount

liquidity risk
gea group is exposed to liquidity risk in that it may be unable to meet payment obligations because it
has insufficient cash funds at its disposal gea group is responsible for managing this risk cash funds
are arranged and credit lines managed on the basis of a multiyear financial plan and a rolling month
bymonth cash forecast the funds are then made available to the companies by group management
cash flow from operating activities is the most important source of liquidity cash pools have been

      established in 13 countries in order to optimize borrowing and the use of cash funds within gea
      group to achieve this the cash pools automatically balance the accounts of the participating group
      companies every day by crediting or debiting a target account at gea group aktiengesellschaft this
      prevents separate cash investments and borrowings by these companies to a large extent any
      additional liquidity requirements are generally borrowed by the gea group aktiengesellschaft which
      also invests surplus liquidity

      foreign currency sensitivity analysis
      gea group companies are always exposed to foreign currency risk if their cash flows are denominated
      in a currency other than their own functional currency foreign currency risk is hedged using suitable
      instruments thus largely offsetting fluctuations arising from the hedged item and the hedging
      transaction over their term

      the foreign currency risk presented in the sensitivity analysis results from the following transactions

       currency derivatives that are included in hedging relationships for previously unrecognized hedged
        items ie for contractually agreed or expected transactions
        as these hedging relationships are regularly documented as such and presented as cash flow hedges
        only equity is affected by exchange rate risk

       crosscurrency swaps
        although swaps are matched by intragroup receivables as hedged items they are not included in a
        documented hedging relationship while receivables are measured using the spot rate the currency
        components of the swaps are measured on the basis of the forward rates the two rates could differ
        significantly depending on the interest rate difference between the two currencies

       unhedged foreign currency transactions
        the translation of foreign currency receivables or liabilities at the closing rate has a direct effect on
        earnings

the nominal amount relates to all contractually agreed foreign currency cash flows as of the reporting
date which are translated into euros at the closing rate

the potential fluctuations in the profit or loss for the year result primarily from derivatives that are
not included in a designated hedging relationship but are used to avoid currency risk as part of the
general hedging strategy

interest rate sensitivity analysis
the interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest
income and expenses and equity the sensitivity analyses are based on the following assumptions

 nonderivative fixedrate financial instruments are only subject to onbalancesheet interest rate risk if
  they are measured at fair value gea group measures such financial instruments at amortized cost

 nonderivative variablerate financial instruments whose interest payments are not included as
  hedged items in a hedging relationship that is recognized as a cash flow hedge are subject to interest
  rate risk in the income statement

 interest rate derivatives included in a hedging relationship that is recognized as a cash flow hedge
  are subject to equityrelated interest rate risk in the amount of the effective portion of the hedging
  relationship

 interest rate derivatives not included in a hedging relationship that is recognized as a cash flow
  hedge are subject to interest rate risk in the income statement

 currency derivatives are not subject to material interest rate risk and therefore have no effect on
  interest rate sensitivity

      the sensitivity analysis assumes a linear shift in the yield curves for all currencies of 100 or 10 basis
      points as of the reporting date relatively speaking there is less of a downward shift in the yield curve
      shift assumed for the sensitivity analysis than an upward shift the low near 0 percent interest rate
      level avoids a shift to a significant negative interest rate this results in the following effects for the
      simulated scenarios

gea heat exchangers segment
following a comprehensive technological and strategic review of gea groups segments the executive
board of gea group aktiengesellschaft initiated the sale of the gea heat exchangers segment
gea hx in june 2013 with the agreement of the supervisory board the gea hx segment has one of
the largest heat exchanger portfolios in the world and provides products and systems for numerous
applications and areas of use ranging from air conditioning systems to cooling towers there is
however only a limited potential for synergies between gea hx and the other segments in gea
groups portfolio due to the differing business profiles

gea group entered into an agreement for the sale of the gea hx segment to funds advised by triton
on april 16 2014 the transaction was completed on october 31 2014

the selling price for the gea hx segment was based on an enterprise value calculated as of the
december 31 2013 reporting date the purchase price was not adjusted to reflect any profit generated
by gea hx between that date and completion of the transaction consequently the profit recorded by
gea hx after december 31 2013 was to the economic advantage of the purchaser on completion of the
transaction

as the ifrs 5 conditions were met for the first time at the 2013 yearend the gea hx segment was
classified as a discontinued operation as of that date this means that income and expenses from the
gea hx segment are reported in the income statement under profit or loss after tax from discontinued
operations in addition the assets and liabilities of the gea hx disposal group were reported in the
balance sheet under assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale from december 31 2013 until
the completion of the transaction

the groups operating segments were reorganized at the beginning of 2014 the activities of the former
gea food solutions and gea mechanical equipment segments are now reported under the segment
name gea mechanical equipment see note 91 consequently the goodwill attributable to the gea
food solutions segment was reclassified to the gea mechanical equipment segment

impairment test
goodwill recoverability was tested at the end of fiscal year 2014 the segments were identified as cash
generating units for this impairment test the recoverable amounts for the segments were compared
with their carrying amounts which included any goodwill allocated to them

the recoverable amount of a segment is determined by calculating value in use using the discounted
cash flow method the cash flows used are the aftertax operating cash flows from the consolidated
mediumterm planning threeyear period planned on a bottomup basis and prepared by the executive
board the supervisory board approved this planning for 2015 and has taken note of it for 2016
and 2017 assumptions for the period beyond the planning horizon are based on the cash flows in the
previous planning year extrapolated using a uniform growth rate of 15 percent previous year
15 percent the underlying growth rates do not exceed the average longterm growth rates for the
markets in which the segments operate

the planning assumes continued stable growth in the food and drink sales markets this assumption
is based on an expectation of growing demand for processed foods all of gea groups segments will
profit from these underlying trends although less strong in comparison to the food industry growth
is also assumed for other customer industries by contrast declining growth rates have been factored
in for the marine sector in addition planned growth for individual segments also takes account of
actual past growth rates

      with regard to raw material prices it is assumed that any increase can be offset by increased selling
      prices measures under the fit for 2020 project and future acquisitions have not been taken into
      account in the planning

      the total cost of capital assumed for discounting is based on a riskfree interest rate of 175 percent
      previous year 275 percent and a market risk premium of 675 percent previous year 575 percent in
      addition beta factors derived from the respective peer group a borrowing risk premium as well as
      capital structure were taken into account for each segment segmentspecific tax rates were also applied

      these brands are tested for impairment at least once a year for this purpose their internal value in
      use is determined using the relief from royalty method under this approach the value of a brand is
      calculated on the basis of the future royalties that gea group would have to pay if it had to license the
      brands from third parties the brandrelated revenue is multiplied by the estimated license fee
      installments the brandrelated revenue is derived from the mediumterm planning prepared by the
      executive board the supervisory board approved this planning for 2015 and has taken note of it for
      2016 and 2017 the assumed license fee installments generally correspond to those of the initial
      measurement the payments saved calculated in this way are then discounted using a brandspecific
      pretax discount rate valuation is based on the following assumptions

      defined contribution pension plans

      defined benefit pension plan obligations exist in germany and outside of germany mainly in the
      usa switzerland and the united kingdom in addition other foreign companies have typical
      countryspecific pension plans that are funded in part by plan assets benefits and investments
      correspond to the countryspecific economic environment and requirements
      gea group views granting pension benefits as an opportunity to foster employee loyalty and
      engagement it is therefore a standard feature of the remuneration concept and has an employee
      contribution component where this is appropriate in connection with this gea group monitors
      developments on the human resources market and regularly checks that the benefits it grants are
      appropriate and in line with the market

      gea group does not believe that the pension obligations pose any risks over and above the customary
      extent and the general risks described

      pension benefits in germany

      of their compensation under this arrangement an agreed amount of their salary plus an employer
      contribution of up to 100 percent of the deferred amount is converted into a pension benefit
      a corresponding collective bargaining agreement was entered into in 2002 and revised in 2008

      managers receive benefits comprising an incomerelated employerfunded basic amount an employer
      funded topup and a matching amount funded through deferred compensation with an employer
      contribution of up to onethird of the deferred amount the additional contributions from the topup

for both commitments the postretirement benefits are adjusted by 1 percent each year

company these plans are generally closed to new employees but are maintained unchanged for employees
who were members at the time the plan was closed these include obligations under bochumer verband
and essener verband as well as obligations established independently by their predecessors

pension benefits outside germany
pension benefits outside germany mainly exist in the usa the united kingdom and switzerland

in the usa there are pension obligations from various pension plans that were closed in succession
up to december 31 2000 no further benefits are earned from a defined benefit pension plan for periods
of service after the respective closure date oldage and survivors benefits accrued at the closure date
of the respective plan were fixed on the basis of pensionable income at the closure date benefits may
be paid out in the form of annuities or lumpsum payments existing pension obligations are partly
funded by plan assets the assets are held separately from the company in an external trust the
companies have appointed independent trustees in accordance with statutory provisions to manage
the funding of obligations and the investment of assets according to the companys specifications any
funding deficit is established annually in accordance with legal requirements and spread over a fixed
time period if required the statutory basis for minimum funding was last amended in 2012 by the
moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21

in the united kingdom there are pension obligations from two uk pension plans one of which has
been closed for a number of years and applies exclusively to former employees the second plan is
closed to new employees but continues to provide oldage and survivors benefits to the currently
active participants based on pensionable income in the year before the employment relationship ends
these benefits are funded by salarydependent employee contributions to plan assets the accrued
entitlements and current benefits in the united kingdom are adjusted in accordance with statutory
requirements on the basis of inflation pension obligations from both plans are partly funded by plan
assets the companies appointed independent trustees in accordance with statutory provisions to
manage the funding of obligations and the investment of assets according to the companys
specifications company pension plans are valued every three years in accordance with legal
requirements and any deficit is established if the plan is underfunded the trustee prepares a funding
plan to regulate the funding of the deficit taking account of the actuarys recommendation and the
type and circumstances of the respective plan

in switzerland there are pension obligations from the second pillar of the swiss pension system the
compulsory occupational pension plan implementation is by means of foundations that are
independent from the companies employers and employees pay incomedependent contributions to
the foundations interest is applied in accordance with legal provisions to the individual amounts
saved and on retirement the total is converted into an oldage invalidity and survivors pension based
on predetermined annuity tables investment and management of the assets is guided by the statutory

      of pension plans companies only have a small number of options available to them for varying the
      design eg level of employee contribution level of contributions according to age band a board of
      trustees comprising employer and employee representatives decides on the distribution of surpluses
      or on changes to the design of the plan within the legal framework the plans come under the
      bundesgesetz über die berufliche vorsorge bvg  swiss federal law on occupational benefits which
      regulates the minimum benefits to be provided by companies by defining the minimum contributions
      required and the returns on them the gea group companies that are affected by this have insured
      their employees with the axa winterthur group foundation all employers may have to contribute
      stabilization payments if there is insufficient cover for the obligations no stabilization plan is
      required at present as the cover is currently sufficient

      supplementary healthcare benefits
      in addition to occupational pension benefits certain retired employees are granted health insurance
      subsidies new entitlements to health insurance subsidies are no longer granted there are now only a
      few employees with such benefits in active employment existing obligations are not funded by plan
      assets gea group does not see these benefits posing a particular risk due to the low level of the
      obligations

      obligations under supplementary healthcare benefits relate solely to germany

      particularly in germany gea group has decided to utilize the internal financing effect of the pension
      provisions and supplementary healthcare benefits and only to fund a relatively small proportion of the
      pension obligations using plan assets

      in the usa the united kingdom and switzerland a large proportion of the pension obligations is
      funded by plan assets in accordance with the legal framework the above table shows how the plan
      assets have been invested a proportion of both the german and foreign plan assets is managed by
      insurance companies in accordance with their specific investment guidelines in germany this is the
      predominant form of investment for plan assets part of the plan assets of german pension plans is
      also managed by pension funds and an endowment fund and is mainly invested in fixedincome
      securities and term deposits with only a relatively small proportion invested in equities the objective
      of these external investments is to ensure secure returns and preserve the value of the underlying
      assets in order to fund current and future pension benefits there are currently no plans to change this
      investment strategy

      assets invested in the capital markets are exposed to general capital market and investment risk gea
      group is constantly monitoring market developments and has developed corresponding investment
      policies that adequately balance risk and income expectations while taking the respective statutory
      and regulatory frameworks into account

the actuarial measurement factors for german plans are established by gea group in consultation
with actuarial experts the corresponding assumptions for plans outside germany are determined
taking into account countryspecific conditions with the help of local experts in consultation with the
global experts and gea group the discount rate is established using a recognized method based on
the return on high quality corporate bonds determined as of the reporting date taking into account the
currency and maturities of the underlying liabilities for countries that do not have a liquid market in
corporate bonds that are suitable for setting the discount rate interest rates on government bonds are
referred to instead to define the rate

all other assumptions correspond to the longterm expectations of gea group the nominal rate of
wage and salary increases is calculated based on expected inflation and a real rate of increase the rate
of pension increases in germany is also determined based on inflation provided that the pension
adjustments are determined in accordance with the rise in the cost of living in addition the financial
position of the relevant company is also taken into account if a firm pension adjustment commitment
has been made this is taken into account accordingly outside of germany the pension adjustment is
also generally determined on the basis of inflation the growth rate assumed for the costs of
supplementary healthcare benefits in germany equates to forecast inflation plus a growth rate based
on historical data based on this data the growth rate is not expected to change in the future

as in the previous year klaus heubecks 2005g mortality tables were used as a basis for measuring all
german plans as of december 31 2014 on this basis the life expectancy of a 65yearold pensioner as of
the reporting date is 2162 years for men and 2401 years for women previous year 1889 years2297 years
countryspecific measurement bases were used for pension liabilities outside germany

      the sensitivities presented below apply to the discount rate and inflation which have been identified
      as actuarial assumptions that have a significant influence on gea groups benefit obligations since
      the wage and salary increase rate the pension increase rate and the growth rate in the cost of
      supplementary health benefits are derived from inflation sensitivity to inflation was used to measure
      the sensitivity of these assumptions together the same calculation methods were used for sensitivities
      as for the recognized provisions the ranges used to compute the sensitivities of the assumptions are
      based on the changes that are deemed possible until the next reporting date given historical experience
      the meaningfulness of historical experience for forecasts of future outcomes and neglecting to update

   notes to the consolidated financial statements  consolidated balance sheet disclosures equity and liabilities




two multiemployer pension plans operated by several employers in the netherlands were recognized
as defined contribution pension plans because the respective managers of the plans do not provide
sufficient information to the participating companies on the amount of the obligation and of the plan
assets for them to be recognized as defined benefit pension plans

in the first plan neither a surplus nor a deficit would have any effect on the level of future contributions
contributions amounting to eur 2494 thousand previous year eur 2255 thousand were made to
this multiemployer pension plan in fiscal year 2014 it is expected that contributions for fiscal year
2015 will be at a similar level

the second multiemployer pension plan has around 12 million beneficiaries of whom around 600
belong to gea group the assetliability ratio of this plan must amount to at least 105 percent neither
a surplus nor a deficit in the plan would result in additional payments from or into the plan for the
participating companies however if the minimum funding level is not met future contributions to be
paid by the participating companies may be increased contributions amounting to eur 3783 thousand
previous year eur 3091 thousand were made to the multiemployer pension plan in fiscal year 2014
it is expected that contributions for fiscal year 2015 will be at a similar level

634    sharebased payment
sharebased payments in fiscal year 2014 for the group as a whole totaled eur 1370 thousand previous
year eur 8240 thousand of this amount income of eur 274 thousand previous year expense of
eur 729 thousand was attributable to the sold gea hx segment for cashsettled sharebased payment
transactions and an expense of eur 21 thousand previous year income of eur 21 thousand for
equitysettled sharebased payment transactions see section 61 the carrying amount of liabilities
arising from sharebased payment transactions in the complete group amounted to eur 10493 thousand
as of december 31 2014 previous year eur 12408 thousand in the previous year eur 758 thousand
of this amount was attributable to the gea hx disposal group

performance share plan
effective july 1 2006 gea group aktiengesellschaft launched a longterm remuneration program
entitled gea performance share plan a cashsettled sharebased payment plan for all first and
secondlevel managers below the executive board thirdlevel managers were also eligible to participate
starting with the third tranche of the program as of july 1 2008 the ninth tranche was issued on
july 1 2014 the goal of the gea performance share plan is to link managers remuneration with the
longterm success of the company and to align their interests with those of the shareholders

under the plan participants are granted a defined number of performance shares at the beginning of
the performance period the number of performance shares allotted is determined by the participants
management level to participate in the plan managers must invest 20 percent of the amount of the
allotted performance shares in shares of gea group aktiengesellschaft the personal investment
must then be held for three years performance period

the performance of gea group aktiengesellschafts shares relative to the companies included in a
benchmark index over the threeyear performance period is measured on the basis of their total
shareholder return tsr the mdax was used as the benchmark for the tranches issued in the years

      up to and including 2013 the benchmark for the 2014 tranche is the stoxx europe tmi industrial
      engineering tmi ie this change in the benchmark index has harmonized the plan with the share
      based payments for executive board members tsr is a suitable indicator for investors to compare the
      performance and appeal of different companies it measures the total percentage return that an
      investor earns from a share over a certain period in addition to share price performance dividends
      and adjustments such as share splits are included in the calculation of tsr this method of comparison
      eliminates share price performance that is due to general market volatility and enables the effects of
      different profit retention strategies to be compared the relative performance of gea group
      aktiengesellschafts shares determines the number of performance shares finally paid out between
      0 percent and 300 percent

phantom shares
a longterm incentive component was added to the bonus arrangements for executive board members
in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 under this half of the bonus was payable with the regular salary payment
and the other half was converted into phantom shares of the company it was calculated as the
arithmetic mean of the daily closing prices of gea group shares in xetra trading operated by the
frankfurt stock exchange on the trading days in the threemonth period that ended one month before
the date of the supervisory board meeting convened in fiscal year 2014 to adopt the financial
statements

the payout value of the phantom shares is calculated following the expiration of a lockup period of
three years following the conversion into phantom shares the amount of the payout is calculated as
the arithmetic mean of the daily closing prices of gea group aktiengesellschaft shares in xetra trading
operated by the frankfurt stock exchange on the trading days in the threemonth period that ends one
month before the date of the relevant supervisory board meeting convened to adopt the financial
statements in the fiscal year in which the lockup period expires the dividends payable per share
during the lockup period are added to the value calculated in this way the amount to be paid out
under these arrangements is limited to 300 percent of the annual basic bonus in the event of
termination of the executive board members contract of service the threeyear vesting period is
reduced to one year as from the date of termination

because the exercise price is zero and this sharebased payment program does not feature a vesting
period the fair value of the phantom shares corresponds to the quoted market price of gea group
aktiengesellschaft shares the fair value of the liability for the 2011 tranche is calculated by multiplying
the number of phantom shares by the relevant closing price plus dividends paid during the lockup
period the 2010 tranche was paid out in full in fiscal year 2014 at a payout price of eur 3410 due to
the termination of an executive board members contract of service part of the 2011 tranche was also
paid out at a price of eur 3511

      the relevant price for the phantom shares issued in fiscal year 2011 was eur 3830 previous
      year eur 3570 in fiscal year 2014 expenses of eur 180 thousand previous year eur 1453 thousand
      were recognized in respect of phantom shares the liability as of december 31 2014 amounted to

      longterm share price component
      the longterm share price component was introduced as part of the revision of the variable
      remuneration system for executive board members in fiscal year 2012 the payout from the longterm
      share price component is measured over a threeyear performance period that includes the relevant
      fiscal year and the two subsequent years

      performance is measured by comparing the performance of the gea share price adjusted for dividends
      with the performance of the stoxx europe tmi industrial engineering tmi ie index over a three
      year performance period the starting value for the comparison calculation is the arithmetic mean of
      the closing prices of the last 20 trading days before the commencement of the threeyear performance
      period 100 percent of the target is achieved if the performance of the arithmetic mean of the gea
      share daily closing prices is equal to 100 percent of the corresponding tmi performance over the three
      year performance period in the event of outperformance by more than 100 percent the bonus
      increases up to a maximum of 300 percent of the target amount if the increase in geas share price
      over the threeyear comparison period is less than 100 percent of the growth in the tmi ie the bonus
      is reduced up to a performance of 75 percent for each percentage point over or under 100 percent
      performance the degree of target achievement increases or decreases by 4 percent the total degree of
      target achievement and thus the payout level for the longterm share price component is limited to
      300 percent of this target amount cap

      starting from a target amount of eur 1793 thousand previous year eur 1188 thousand the fair
      value of claims arising from the longterm share price component amounted to eur 2664 thousand
      previous year eur 1908 thousand as of the reporting date

      the fair value of the claims arising from the longterm share price component is determined using a

there were no transfers into or out of the levels of the fair value hierarchy in fiscal year 2014

the fair value of the bond and the other financial assets is calculated on the basis of quoted bid prices
on an active market and is therefore categorized within level 1 the fair value includes the interest
deferred as of the reporting date

the fair value of derivatives is calculated using quoted exchange rates and yield curves observable in
the market accordingly these are categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy

the fair value of term deposits borrowers note loans and liabilities to banks is measured on the basis
of the yield curve taking into account credit spreads they are therefore categorized within level 2 of
the fair value hierarchy the interest deferred as of the reporting date is included in the fair values

the fair values of trade receivables cash and cash equivalents term deposits and other financial
receivables essentially correspond to the carrying amounts this is due to the predominantly short
remaining maturities

certain other financial liabilities resulting from the sale of the gea hx segment are categorized within
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy since their fair value is measured on the basis of the present value
of future cash outflows expected on the basis of contractual obligations associated with the sale

nonderivative financial liabilities
the carrying amount of the trade payables and other current liabilities that are subject to the
measurement rules of ias 39 corresponds to their fair value the fair value of fixedrate liabilities is
the present value of their expected future cash flows they are discounted at the rates prevailing at the
reporting date the carrying amount of variablerate liabilities corresponds to their fair value

derivative financial instruments
the fair value of currency forwards at the reporting date is calculated on the basis of the spot exchange
rate taking into account forward premiums and discounts corresponding to the relevant remaining
maturities forward premiums and discounts are derived from yield curves observable at the reporting
date the fair value of currency options is calculated on the basis of recognized valuation models fair
value is affected by the remaining term of the option the current exchange rate the volatility of the
exchange rate and the underlying yield curves

the fair value of interest rate swaps and options is determined on the basis of discounted expected
future cash flows market interest rates applicable to the remaining maturities of these financial
instruments are used crosscurrency swaps also include the exchange rates of the relevant foreign
currencies in which the cash flows are generated

the fair value of commodity futures and options is calculated by measuring these at the market terms
prevailing at the reporting date and thus corresponds to its value at the end of the fiscal year the fair
value of exchangetraded contracts is derived from their quoted market price measurements are
performed both internally and by external financial institutions as of the reporting date

gea group uses derivative financial instruments including currency forwards interest rate swaps
crosscurrency swaps and commodity futures derivative financial instruments serve to hedge foreign
currency risk interest rate risk and commodity price risk for existing or planned underlying
transactions

      derivative financial instruments included in recognized hedging relationships
      derivative financial instruments included in recognized hedging relationships serve exclusively to
      hedge foreign currency risks from future sale and procurement transactions as well as interest rate
      risks from longterm financing cash flow hedges fair value hedges are recognized to hedge changes
      in the fair value of assets liabilities or firm commitments as in the previous year the group had not
      entered into any fair value hedges as of december 31 2014

      derivatives are measured at fair value which is split into an effective and an ineffective portion the
      effective portion and any change in this amount are recognized in other comprehensive income until
      the hedged item is recognized in the balance sheet the ineffective portion is recognized in the income
      statement when the hedged item is recognized in the balance sheet gains and losses recognized in
      equity are realized and the hedge is unwound in the case of a sale transaction the effective portion is
      recognized as revenue whereas in the case of a procurement transaction the cost is adjusted
      accordingly in the case of interest rate derivatives the gains and losses recognized in equity are
      reversed to net interest income

      as of december 31 2014 the complete group recognized gains of eur 5576 thousand previous
      year eur 7860 thousand and losses of eur 13030 thousand previous year eur 7168 thousand
      from currency and interest rate derivatives directly in equity

      in the course of fiscal year 2014 eur 47 thousand previous year eur 1956 thousand was recognized
      in the income statement due to the hedged items being recognized in the balance sheet and
      eur 3497 thousand previous year eur 2335 thousand was offset against the cost of assets the
      amounts recognized in the income statement resulted in an increase in revenue of eur 1545 thousand
      previous year eur 1010 thousand in addition gains of eur 5419 thousand previous year gains of
      eur 4330 thousand and losses of eur 7012 thousand previous year losses of eur 4061 thousand
      were reported in net exchange rate gainslosses eur 0 thousand previous year eur 826 thousand
      from interest rate derivatives was recognized in net interest income

      as in the previous year there was no significant hedge ineffectiveness

      96 percent previous year 93 percent of the hedged cash flows from the underlying transactions
      designated at the reporting date are expected to fall due in the following year the remaining 4 percent
      previous year 7 percent are due by 2017 previous year 2017 if financial assets are hedged the
      derivatives are recognized in the income statement at the same time as the hedged items are recognized
      in the income statement and balance sheet if financial liabilities from procurement transactions are
      hedged the derivatives are recognized in the income statement when the purchased goods or services
      are recognized in the income statement

dörries scharmann ag insolvency proceedings
an action brought by the insolvency administrator of dörries scharmann ag against gea group
aktiengesellschaft is pending at the düsseldorf regional court the former metallgesellschaft ag the
legal predecessor to gea group aktiengesellschaft held an interest in schiess ag which later became
dörries scharmann ag on the basis of that interest the insolvency administrator is asserting various
claims under company law in particular for equity substitution which amount to approximately
eur 20 million including possible interest gea group aktiengesellschaft considers the claims that
have been asserted to be unfounded after the senior expert appointed by the court to decide matters
relating to equity substitution fully confirmed gea group aktiengesellschafts opinion the higher
regional court in düsseldorf upheld a motion by the insolvency administrator to disqualify this expert
in a ruling issued on november 27 2012 how the regional court will proceed in this matter is
currently unknown gea group aktiengesellschaft will continue to defend itself against all claims

general
further legal proceedings or official investigations have been or may be instituted against gea group
companies as a result of earlier business disposals and operating activities

adequate provisions have been recognized for all risks arising from both the legal disputes described
above and other legal disputes being pursued by gea group in the course of its ordinary operating
activities however the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty
it is therefore possible that the conclusion of the proceedings may result in expenses that exceed the
amounts that may have been set aside for them
