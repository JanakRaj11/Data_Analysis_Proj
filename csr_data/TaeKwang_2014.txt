 renewable energy expansion plan and activity
 our scope of sustainable resource activity now includes efficient energy usage by converting
 manufacturing energy to renewable energy we are also using solar power for outsole
 cleaning dormitory hotwater streetlights in vietnam and ip injection phylon cleaning at
 indonesia tt all these activities will help secure sustainable energy for the future t2 has also
 been part of an energy reduction campaign by installing a solar energy system on the roof of
 t2 headquarters t2 groups target for next year is to reduce 55 tons of co2 emissions by
 using renewable energy




energy saving consulting from korea energy management
corporation
we are also leveraging our relationship with korea energy management corporation to assist our
energy reduction efforts across the t2 group they are helping us by prioritizing our factories
matching appropriate energy types and other solutions that will maximize energy cost savings

the discharge of solid waste increased by 64 from 1882gpr in fy12 to 2004gpr in fy14 key
factors to increase solid waste are mostly from defective products and waste scraps minimizing
cgrade products and cutting scrap should be controlled to reduce solid waste


       greenovation project
 we have researched and encouraged employees to come up with ideas on how to
 recyclereuse solid waste since we have generated from our manufacturing process
 we call this project greenovation which is a compound word between green and innovation
 and it means we can achieve a sustainable environment through innovative ideas
 we made cup coasters mouse pads and cushions for stitching workers out of solid waste
 we opened an innovation center called the istudio and we used old molds for the showroom
 floor

 recycling into process from generated waste
all generated solid waste including hazardous waste is collected at a designated location and
segregated by its properties to treat properly and classify recyclable material papers plastics cans
are 100 recycled and rubber and eva sponge is reused in house for recycled formulation we are
working with certain suppliers for closed loop project gather all material scrap from them and
returned to the production process
below is the captured number of recycled material from generated solid waste from each production
plant

the usage of hazardous chemicals last fy14 was reduced to 138 compared to fy12
this is attributed to waterbased adhesives waterbased uv primers waterbased rubber
primers and an automation process also the change of the bonding process to an auto feeding
system from personal containers helped decrease the solvent usage and the generation of
hazardous materials

                                       dcs dye coloring system is an innovative technology that
                                       reduces the use of hazardous chemicals when dyeing
                                       airbags the benefit of this is that we reuse more than 90
                                       of the npa n propane alcohol in the distillation system
                                       and the carbon filter also water for cleaning can be
                                       recycled with a simple carbon filter

closed loop system auto buffing
the new technology and equipment of the rd team are able to examine how much the raw
materials and generated waste affect the environment and its sustainable technology and
manufacturing process
auto buffing technology is a typical example of the new technique which uses ecofriendly
baking power with water by machine instead of the previous manual work of the grindbuffing
method this ensures more than 90 of the water and baking powder is reused and that the
safety and health of workers are guaranteed

     approximately 11 billion people around the world suffer from water shortage on a daily basis
     furthermore it is expected that 40 of the worlds population will experience a severe water
     shortage by 2050 according to the oecd environmental outlook released in aug 2012
     for the clean water in and out strategy every manufacturing facility has their own waste
     water treatment facility except vt which is discharging waste water to dongnai industrial
     waste water treatment plant
     all the waste water treatment plant capacity is big enough to treat generated waste water into
     recycled water which is used for gardening and flushing water
