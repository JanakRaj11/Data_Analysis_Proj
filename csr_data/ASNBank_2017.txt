mission and strategy
asn bank was founded in 1960 for more than 55 years we have made it our mission as a bank to promote
sustainability in society we use the money our customers entrust to us to fuel sustainable progress contributing to
a world where people can live safely and healthily and where nature is protected now and in the future

asn bank stands for sustainable banking to execute this mission we have developed a twofold strategy with
longterm objectives for both our banking activities and our activities in the area of sustainability


sustainability strategy
sustainability is paramount in all of asn banks activities as we exercise most influence on the world by means of
our loans and investments we apply our sustainability criteria to all of those activities

we use three instruments to encourage sustainable progress in the framework of our activities as a bank the
selection of investments and loans voting at shareholders meetings of the companies in which the
asn investment funds invest and engagement with companies we also engage in dialogue with companies
within and sometimes outside the asn investment universe which contains companies countries and projects that
have been approved on sustainability grounds the aim here is to encourage these companies to make
sustainable choices our engagement with the pharmaceutical industry is the principal example of this process

however as we are not a large company our choice for sustainability makes only a small difference on a global
scale that is why we have developed the following sustainability strategy we increase our influence by
encouraging others to make sustainable choices we do so by setting ourselves longterm goals for each pillar of
our sustainability policy human rights climate change and biodiversity these goals are integrated into our banking
activities at the same time we encourage other financial institutions to set similar goals and also consult external
stakeholders about our longterm sustainability goals in this way we increase the impact of our longterm goals

our longterm goals are as follows

human rights all garment companies in the asn investment universe are to pay their workers a living wage by
2030

climate change all our loans and investments are to be net climate neutral by 2030

biodiversity our loans and investments are to cause no net loss of biodiversity by 2030

we also encourage societal debate on sustainability by communicating about our sustainability criteria and about
the selection process for our loans and investments for example in addition we organise events on the theme of
sustainability for a wide range of customers and other stakeholders

finally we facilitate innovative sustainability initiatives through our online platform for the world of tomorrow and
crowdfunding thus helping people with a feasible sustainability initiative to make a success of it


banking strategy
asn bank wants to grow but this is not a goal in itself we want to grow so that we can step up our efforts towards
sustainable progress and increase our investments in sustainable businesses projects and governments

for these reasons we have set three growth targets for our banking activities we aim to have one million satisfied
customers ensure controlled growth of our assets under management and increase our corporate loans and
investments

one million satisfied customers
the more customers we have the greater our influence on the sustainability of society that explains our aim to
grow to one million customers  with an important addition one million satisfied customers we want to make
sustainable banking accessible and attractive by good service provision and an expanded range of products and
services to achieve this growth we are going to invest in increasing awareness of our brand and of the concept of
sustainable banking making asn bank more attractive to potential customers

                                                                                                                                4

                                                                                                           asn bank report 2016

the financial world is rapidly changing as a result of new possibilities in the area of information technology we are
applying the emerging new developments in a smart way in accordance with the choices made on this subject by
our parent company de volksbank

growth in assets under management
in line with our aim of controlled growth of our assets under management we do not want to just offer customers
sustainable investment but rather easy sustainable investment asn beleggingsinstellingen beheer bv abb
develops funds and instruments that provide customers with insight into sustainable investment and help them
choose investment funds that are suited to their risk appetite

abb offers asn bank customers sustainable asn investment funds other financial institutions also offer these
funds to their customers in the context of their sustainable investment proposition abb intends to retain this share
in the thirdparty distribution with a particular focus on thirdparty distribution in the netherlands through the other
brands of de volksbank

we aim for controlled growth of savings relative to loans and investments in connection with the sound
development of our balance sheet

growth in corporate loans and investments
we want to increase the volume of loans and investments in renewable energy by funding projects in such areas
as wind and solar energy as well as by investing in green and social bonds in addition these loans and
investments help us achieve our objective of being climate neutral by 2030 we are also developing our lending
operations for the healthcare sector


proposition
to enable us to achieve our objective of growth to one million satisfied customers we finetuned our proposition
in 2016 in the past we placed a great deal of emphasis on the ideal of a just sustainable society this appealed to
the postmaterialists the committed customers passionate about sustainability who traditionally form asn banks
target group motivactions mentality model describes this group as sociallycritical idealists who are interested in
personal growth make a statement against social injustice and defend the environment however this target group
is not large enough to facilitate growth to one million customers

that is why in 2016 we considered ways to make a larger group of potential customers aware of sustainable
banking we want to attract the target group of cosmopolitans without alienating the existing customer group of
postmaterialists according to the mentality model cosmopolitans are critical citizens of the world who integrate
postmodern values such as growth and experience with modern values such as success materialism and
enjoyment we aim to attract them by emphasising the encouragement of sustainable progress in our new
proposition sustainable progress is something that we explicitly encourage in our role as bank enabling our
customers to use their money to make the world a better place we aim to make sustainable banking wellknown
accessible and attractive to everyone we are driving sustainability and offer customers the opportunity to get on
board by banking with us we are presenting ourselves as a sustainability pioneer with the following values
optimistic having a sense of perspective ambitious and socially conscious

our statements describe asn bank as follows asn bank encourages sustainable progress we are a modern
bank for your daytoday banking affairs a sustainable bank that uses money for good in other words we manage
our customers money carefully and use it to fund projects and initiatives that respect people animals and the
environment thus enabling everybody to contribute to a more sustainable world that is how money can buy
happiness

report
this is asn banks sustainability report for 2016 asn bank reports in accordance with the g4 sustainability
reporting guidelines of the global reporting initiative gri at the core level these guidelines are commonly used
sustainability reporting principles their purpose is to promote transparency and to make results clear and
comparable


materiality analysis
we perform a materiality analysis to determine the topics to be addressed in the report to this end in 2015 we
drew up a list of key issues for asn bank this list was based on previous asn bank reports relevant guidelines
and reports of peers in the sector we updated the list for the report on 2016 combining some issues and
amending the wording of others the issue asn investment funds results was added as the relevant page in the
2015 report was visited on many occasions

when interviews were held with asn bank employees in 2014 to establish asn banks stakeholders the following
stakeholder groups were identified retail customers corporate clients employees independent stakeholders
partnering ngos and business partners for the 2016 materiality analysis we sent an email to stakeholders from
the various stakeholder groups requesting them to complete an online questionnaire we asked them to indicate
the level of importance they attached to each issue the average score for each issue was determined per
stakeholder group then the average score for each issue was determined for all groups taken together retail
customers counted for 50 percent in this respect with the other groups combined also counting for 50 percent

in 2015 employees of asn bank who were involved in sustainability and reporting jointly determined the impact
that the various issues have on asn bank this took place at an interactive session for employees from various
departments who were involved in sustainability and reporting the departments represented were sustainability 
research controlling investment sustainable loans and communication all participants could vote on the
various issues during this session with the outcome representing the average of everyones input the results of
the session were discussed with the asn bank management board taking the results from 2015 as a basis we
used documentation from 2016 to update the relevance of the issues for asn bank the results of the materiality
analysis are shown in the diagram

human rights a living wage
it is still by no means a reality fair pay for people who make everyday consumer goods the minimum wage in
sectors such as clothing electronics and food is often not enough to live on in some cases it is even too low for
survival that is particularly true for workers employed by suppliers in these sectors

although awareness of these problems is increasing including at the companies themselves the situation
demands action that is why asn bank is going to work towards living wages over the next few years


what is a living wage
a living wage is one that allows workers to meet their own basic needs and those of their families this covers
food clothing housing education and healthcare in addition the breadwinner should be able to set aside around
ten percent of their pay for unexpected costs the level of this living wage differs from country to country the
introduction of a living wage does not just help raise the standard of living of workers and their families  it is often
a catalyst for the improvement of other working conditions as well for example the probability of child labour
decreases if parents earn enough money


longterm goal
the focus of our work towards living wages is on companies in the garment industry particularly those in the
asn investment universe some of these companies are already making good progress but none of them have
introduced a living wage yet consequently we have set ourselves the following longterm goal

all garment companies in the asn investment universe are to pay their workers a living wage by 2030

this is based on the garment companies that were approved for the asn investment universe on 1 april 2016 one
of these companies gap was disapproved in late 2016 as it no longer satisfied our sustainability criteria we are
however continuing to engage with this company on the subject of a living wage consequently we are now
focusing on the following fourteen companies adidas amer sports asics asos esprit gap gildan activewear
hm inditex kappahl lojas renner marks  spencer nike and puma


considerations underlying this choice
there are numerous possible goals in the area of human rights our choice of the longterm goal a living wage in
the garment industry was based on various considerations we can implement this objective in our role as investor
by engaging with companies in that role we expect to be able to promote living wages in the garment industry in
addition we are pleased to offer other financial institutions the opportunity to join our process we aim to inspire
them to do something about the living wage issue themselves by joining forces we can achieve our goal more
quickly

there is interest in the living wage issue our customers and other stakeholders find this issue important
moreover it ties in with the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs namely sdg 1 end poverty
sdg 8 economic growth employment and the sdg timelines


united nations recognition
in november we attended the un forum on business and human rights in geneva we presented the working
group with the report unpacking the case for the living wage in law practice and commerce the working group
expressed its support for the research and described it as an important study


fair bank guide assessment
in june 2016 the fair bank guide published a report on banks and fair pay and freedom of association in the
electronics and garment industries the fair bank guide investigated how dutch banks deal with the risk of human
rights violations in the production chains of garment and electronics companies in which they invest or that they
finance paying specific attention to the payment of a living wage and freedom of association together with
triodos bank we scored 10 out of 10 for policy and practice in this area




                                                                                                                                  10

living wage approach and baseline measurement
as the objectives essence lies in measuring the social impact of our investments in the garment industry the
impact centre erasmus ice made its expertise available ice uses its scientific knowledge to work with
organisations helping them gain a better understanding of their impact as they try to achieve their social ambitions
this involves impact thinking impact measurement and impact management

together with asn bank ice performed a baseline measurement at the fourteen garment companies in the
asn investment universe in 2016 the measurement not only provided insight into the current situation but was
also useful in formulating the longterm goal


open source
social impact measurement is still in its infancy a key precondition that we have set regarding the longterm goal is
for the methodology developed to be accessible to other interested parties the impact centre erasmus too is
convinced that it is imperative to share not only the results but especially also the road travelled to get there in this
way we help build the collective knowledge on the living wage and the knowledge on social impact measurement


baseline measurement
we used the baseline measurement to identify where the fourteen garment companies stood at that time the
following choices were made with respect to this measurement

   we based our measurement on desk research and data received directly from the companies by telephone and
    email
   we based our measurement on desk research and data received directly from the companies by telephone and
    email
   we assessed companies policies as well as their practices
   we confined ourselves to the activities of the companies in the top 25 garment and textile producing countries
    as designated by the international labour organization ilo
   we surveyed the production of the companies themselves and that of their firsttier suppliers


scores and responses
our first question was do companies have a living wage vision andor goal and has it been embedded in policies
and procedures policy is the first step towards ensuring payment of a living wage in this process we also
assessed companies transparency on this point since a key starting point for change is to render account to
stakeholders this survey resulted in scorecards per company

we then sent each company its own scorecard which led to contact with some companies that had not initially
responded to our requests for information ultimately we had contact with all fourteen companies and received
valuable survey responses from them

our requests to companies for information for the baseline measurement prompted discussion about the survey
and about companies policies we received positive responses to the report from esprit and adidas with esprit
even undertaking to change its policy

the report includes scorecards for each company setting out the total score calculated in each case these scores
only pertain to the companies visions policies implementation and transparency and say nothing about the
wages they pay in practice

main conclusions
we drew the following key conclusions from the baseline measurement

   while living wage was not a new concept for twelve of the fourteen companies they did sometimes use other
    terms and definitions such as fair wage and fair living wage
   most companies collaborate with living wage initiatives such as the fair labor association fla the ethical
    trading initiative eti and the act process
   five companies regard collective bargaining  which includes wages  as a key strategy to achieve a living
    wage
   nine companies state in their policies or through initiatives they have joined that they pay the industry average
    wage if it exceeds the minimum wage


experiences in practice
it has proven very difficult to obtain information about how companies deal with the living wage in practice in order
to gain a better understanding of the fourteen companies practices we took stock of the countries where each
company produces its garments and shoes in the report we included information on the minimum wage the
industry average wage and the living wage in all 25 production countries

some conclusions on practices

   five companies can make major strides towards a living wage by introducing the industry average wage if it
    exceeds the minimum wage
   certainly not all companies are transparent about the locations and activities of their suppliers
   it has proven difficult to obtain accurate information about the number of workers in the supply chain the
    wages paid the types of contract the types of production and production volumes per country andor
    production sites


the future
the average score of the fourteen companies resulting from the baseline measurement was 287 we are aiming
for this score to show a ten percent improvement to 316 in 2018 in 2017 we are initiating engagement with the
fourteen garment companies in our investment universe to this end in collaboration with triodos bank

the methodology we have developed for the baseline measurement presents a starting point for measurements to
monitor the progress being made by the garment industry as it is our belief that it will be easier to obtain
information on practices in a few years from now we aim to finetune our methodology we intend to perform a
followup measurement with the impact centre erasmus in 2018 we expect this measurement to yield more insight
into garment companies practices as well as information about the progress they have made in respect of the
living wage


collaboration on human rights
to encourage sustainable development we take part in debates platforms and other initiatives mostly in the areas
of our three sustainability pillars in 2016 we took part in the following human rights platforms

                                                                                                                               12

icsr covenants
companies that are active abroad run the risk of damaging the environment and violating human rights there at
the same time the international role of the netherlands offers opportunities to strengthen sustainable
developments throughout the world for that reason the government is endeavouring to promote international
corporate social responsibility icsr together with thirteen dutch sectors it is making arrangements in icsr
covenants for a joint approach to international corporate social responsibility these arrangements are aimed at
tackling the risks of human rights violations and damage to the environment in production chains

icsr covenant on sustainable garments and textiles
on 6 october 2016 asn bank was the first bank to sign a statement of support for the covenant on sustainable
garments and textiles the covenant signifies a joining of forces by parties in the garment industry for the purpose
of improving the sustainability of the international garment and textile production chain by the end of 2016 there
were 75 signatories including retail companies such as bijenkorf and hema trade unions industry associations
civil society organisations and minister ploumen for foreign trade and development cooperation the retail
companies that have signed the covenant jointly represent more than a third of sales in the dutch garment market

climate change carbon neutrality
the emission of greenhouse gases mainly co2 carbon dioxide is causing todays rapid global warming this
climate change adversely affects nature and peoples wellbeing while there are individuals right up to the highest
level who call this into question the vast majority of climate scientists share this view along with many politicians
companies and citizens

it is vital that the world reach a turning point in its emissions by 2030 at the latest if we are to slow down global
warming after that as soon as possible  but definitely no later than around 2050  a net carbon neutral situation
must have been created meaning that no additional co2 is released into the atmosphere that was the conclusion
of the emissions gap report 2015 by the united nations environment programme unep


longterm goal
six greenhouse gases including co2 methane and nitrogen oxide contribute to the greenhouse effect in our
view we are coresponsible for the emission of these greenhouse gases because of the companies and projects
that we finance or in which we invest in order to express that responsibility in a single figure we convert the
emission of the various greenhouse gases into co2 equivalents based on international standards any reference in
this text to co2 emissions or carbon emissions therefore relates to co2 equivalents

as asn bank wants to take the lead by being the bank that makes a contribution to reducing these emissions we
have adopted the following longterm goal

all our loans and investments are to be net climate neutral by 2030

we realise that asn banks impact on climate change is limited so we use our climate change goal to encourage
other financial institutions to follow our example that is why we are pleased that our parent company de
volksbank has adopted our climate change objective

by 2030 the carbon emissions of our investments and loans must be fully offset by investments and loans that
reduce or avoid carbon emissions in other words we will have fully achieved the goal if our co2 profit equals our
co2 loss




strategy
we reduce the carbon emissions of our banking activities as follows

   we aim not to invest in the extraction production and refining of fossil materials and their use by companies to
    generate electricity
   as regards the energy sector we only finance energy generation from renewable energy sources such as wind
    and solar energy
   we finance energysaving measures lowenergy buildings and energy efficiency
   we prefer to invest in companies that save energy

methodology
in collaboration with the consultancy firm ecofys the world wildlife fund wwf and cdp formerly the carbon
disclosure project have drawn up an overview of the best practices for companies to reduce their indirect co2
emissions the socalled scope 3 emissions according to the greenhouse gas protocol ghg protocol the
international standard for calculating the carbon footprint scope 3 emissions may be subdivided into fifteen
different categories the fifteenth category pertains to co2 emissions caused by a companys investments or loans
it is the key category that financial institutions have to take into account

asn banks carbon profit and loss account was one of the worlds first methods to identify the emissions caused by
investments and loans our common approach towards reducing these emissions prompted wwf and cdp to cite
asn bank and de volksbank as an example in november 2016

we have calculated which item out of all of those on the balance sheet has the largest carbon footprint the
mortgages that de volksbanks brands provide and that asn bank finances in the amount of 45 billion euros are
responsible for most of the emissions for that reason the various brands of de volksbank have examined how
they can reduce the emissions from financed homes pilots took place in 2016 and are being rolled out more
extensively in 2017


good practice mention for approach to climate change
on 9 november asn bank received an honourable mention in a report on companies using innovative solutions to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their value chains cdp wwf and ecofys publish this report annually we
were mentioned in the category investments for our methodology for measuring and reducing the impact that our
investments and loans have on the climate

notes to the results
the climate balance sheet came a step closer to climate neutrality in 2016 this was due on the one hand to an
improvement in data quality and one the other to the sustainable investment and finance policies an expansion of
the mortgage portfolio in the bank balance sheet resulted in additional emissions of 22 kilotonnes which are
accounted for under co2 loss this was countered by the fact that the growth in sustainable loans resulted in a co2
profit of 30 kilotonnes we updated the climate balance sheet with specific emissions data which also had a
positive influence as at 31 december all loans and investments were 717 percent net climate neutral in total


recalculation
according to our methodology co2 emissions and avoided co2 emissions should decrease as the amount repaid
on a loan increases however we could not fully apply the methodology to a portion of asn groenprojectenfonds
loans because the necessary data were not available for these loans the co2 emissions specifically calculated for
our contribution remain constant throughout the term of the loan based on the available data this was the best
way to calculate the avoided co2 emissions at the time it recently transpired that the opportunity would arise to
incorporate the data that were not previously available into the calculation we are going to use these data to
calculate the avoided co2 emissions in 2017 we estimate that this will lead to a reduction in the co2 profit

co2 profit and loss account
the diagram shows what the various sectors recognised in the balance sheet of asn bank and under the
management of the asn investment funds contribute to the co2 emissions and the co2 avoided in our co2 profit
and loss account an explanation follows of the method of calculation for each sector we calculated the margin of

renewable energy projects
asn bank provides project loans for projects in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy such as solar
and wind farms we calculate the net co2 emissions for all project loans many renewable energy projects
ultimately result in co2 emissions being avoided specifically we assume that the electricity generated via
renewable energy projects replaces the generation by fossil fuel power plants electricity generated by a wind farm
results in considerably less co2 than electricity generated by a coalfired power plant we calculate the co2
emissions avoided as follows firstly we determine the share of asn bank in the annual energy yield using our
share in the total financing needs we then multiply the energy yield by the avoided co2 emissions per kilowatt
hour

green bonds
green bonds are bonds whose proceeds are used to finance green projects examples include constructing a wind
farm improving the electricity grid and making homes and buildings energy efficient the net co2 emissions of the
green bond can be calculated depending on the nature of the projects concerned in many cases the issuer reports
the quantity of co2 emissions avoided per year thanks to this avoidance of co2 emissions green bonds
contribute towards the attainment of our climate neutral balance sheet

home finance
the residential mortgages financed by asn bank jointly form the item responsible for the highest co2 emissions
the netherlands enterprise agency rvo enables companies to download energy labels for the homes
concerned these include both indicative and deregistered labels a deregistered label is one that is definitive in
that way we obtain an indication of the energy quality of the houses in our mortgage portfolio the average dutch
electricity and gas consumption is known for each energy label we subsequently convert the kilowatt hours of
electricity and square metres of gas into co2 emissions using emission factors

government bonds
the co2 emissions of government bonds are possibly the most difficult to determine governments issue
government bonds to facilitate government activities in all sectors we determine the direct emissions by taking the
emissions of the government as a sector we determine the indirect emissions by examining what the
governments share is in the total co2 emissions per sector we divide the total emissions by the national debt to
calculate the quantity of co2 emissions for which a government bond is responsible per euro invested

other categories
in addition to the above categories we distinguish the categories banks residential construction lower tiers of
government healthcare water boards and miscellaneous we calculate the co2 emissions for these categories
based on our balance sheet total and the total co2 emissions per sector this results in the co2 emissions per
invested or funded euro the sources we use are data from statistics netherlands and sector reports such as the
dutch water authorities climate monitor and the human environment and transport inspectorates sectorbeeld
van de woningbouw a report on the residential construction sector all of the data used are public


collaboration on climate change
we encourage sustainability by taking part in debates platforms and other initiatives in 2016 we took part in a
large number of partnerships in the context of our climate change sustainability pillar including the climate change
risk working group of the dutch central banks sustainability platform platform duurzaamheid and the dutch
banking associations climate change working group werkgroep klimaat


platform carbon accounting financials
in 2015 we initiated the foundation of the platform carbon accounting financials pcaf the member financial
institutions are jointly developing methods to measure the impact that their investments and loans have on the
climate more insight into that impact will enable them to establish their climate footprint in a more effective and
more uniform manner this understanding will also help them define climate change objectives for their
investments and loans in this way they will contribute to the reduction of societys greenhouse gas emissions

protection of biodiversity
biodiversity means  the variability among living organisms from all sources including inter alia terrestrial marine
and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part this includes diversity within
species between species and of ecosystems

this is the definition given in the convention on biological diversity cbd together with 186 other countries the
netherlands signed this convention in rio de janeiro in 1992


biodiversity is essential
ecosystems provide many things that are essential to our lives such as clean water food a living environment
fuel building materials medicines oxygen nutrients water purification protection against erosion sun and harmful
radiation pollination and recreation

the world is suffering a global loss of biodiversity with two hundred to two thousand species disappearing every
year mainly at the hands of man the main cause is agriculture followed at a distance by climate change forestry
ecosystem fragmentation infrastructure and water pollution


longterm goal
asn bank endorses the cbds vision by 2050 biodiversity is valued conserved restored and wisely used
maintaining ecosystem services sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential for all people we
want to accept our responsibility for this so we have set a longterm biodiversity goal which may be briefly
summarised as no net loss this entails the following

all of asn banks loans and investments are to cause no net loss of biodiversity by 2030


strategy
we aim to achieve this with the help of the following strategies

   we aim to reduce the biodiversity loss for which our loans and investments are responsible the first step is to
    identify which loans and investments have the greatest impact such as the food companies and paper
    companies in which our equity funds invest to this end we can eg work with companies that are frontrunners
    in reducing their ecological footprint
   we finetune the methodology with which we calculate our ecological footprint and monitor progress and
    improve the quality of the data on our ecological footprint by publishing our endeavours we assist financial
    institutions to obtain more insight into their impact on biodiversity and become more aware of this
   we are exploring ways in which we can increase biodiversity gains examples include planting a forest such as
    the asn forest in the bentwoud for loyal asn customers collaborating with nature organisations and water
    companies investing in renewable energy funds and funding projects in the national green fund nationaal
    groenfonds


collaboration is key
we are not doing all this alone we collaborate with various different parties we share our knowledge and develop
our strategy in collaboration with as many interested parties as possible whilst learning from others in the process
there needs to be a joint effort by a great many people and organisations worldwide if we are to protect
biodiversity and thus keep the planet habitable for future generations achieving that goal may seem impossible at
the moment but it is crucial that we work together to do so


determination and fleshing out of biodiversity goal
in late 2014 we began to explore a longterm objective for biodiversity we asked ourselves where do we want to
be in terms of biodiversity in fifteen years time in 2030 will we be actively contributing to strengthening nature in
the netherlands and abroad or are we merely going to avoid being indirectly responsible for a loss of nature




                                                                                                                                   20

                                                                                                           asn bank report 2016

asn banks mission as a bank is to promote sustainability in society keeping the planet habitable is one aspect of
this unfortunately it is not yet possible to scientifically determine what exactly the financial sector can do to make
biodiversity resilient and to keep it so the necessity of insight into our ecological footprint thus emerged how do
our current loans and investments impact biodiversity what does this mean for the longterm goal


challenges
formulating a longterm goal was no simple matter what were the challenges

   loss of biodiversity is a worldwide problem just like climate change but biodiversity is being threatened and
    burdened in various areas in various ways that is why the protection and conservation of biodiversity must
    always be tailored to the situation
   as yet there is no scientific consensus as to what the financial sector can do to make biodiversity resilient once
    again
   nor is there any generally accepted unit of measurement or methodology for measuring biodiversity


measuring our ecological footprint
is it possible to measure asn banks ecological footprint that was the question that pré consultants set out to
answer the firm has been working worldwide on the measurement of the environmental burden using life cycle
analysis lca for the last 25 years lca is a scientifically supported internationally endorsed methodology for
measuring such matters as land use water consumption and climate change

pré consultants lca analysts answered this question in the affirmative we can measure asn banks ecological
footprint and doing so gives rise to interesting insights for example according to the lca calculations the
following applies to asn bank

   climate change land use and water consumption are by far the most significant causes of the loss of
    biodiversity
   the investments in companies make a relatively large contribution to this impact
   the investments in green energy can make a considerable positive contribution to biodiversity this contribution
    may even be so large that the longterm goal of no net loss may be realistic


unit of measurement
this analysis also resulted in the establishment of a unit for measuring our impact on biodiversity the number of
species that have disappeared per square metre to make this workable in practice we convert this number into
an equivalent the number of square kilometres of nature that disappears as a result of our burden on biodiversity
this loss is on a oneoff basis it stays the same from year to year if the investments and loans remain the same
there is no room for nature to develop on that land at that time

the precise number of square kilometres of nature disappearing as a result of our burden on biodiversity was not
yet determined with sufficient certainty in 2016 we will be finetuning the figures further in 2017


qualitative analysis
the calculation of our ecological footprint is subject to limitations consequently we have also had a qualitative
analysis performed of our impact on biodiversity this provides additional sectorspecific information that was not
taken into account in the quantitative research

limitations on the quantitative method include the measurement of positive impacts on biodiversity an example
asn bank invests in paper companies they satisfy our criteria meaning that at least three quarters of the forests
from which they source their wood is fsc certified the positive impact of this certification cannot be taken into
account in the analysis of our ecological footprint yet the result is that a larger footprint is calculated for these
companies than they have in reality another example it is possible that the no fishing zones around offshore wind
turbines have a positive impact on biodiversity however they are not included in the model

nor does the model always take account of local effects if an economic activity takes place in an area with a high
biodiversity value high conservation value area or hcva the impact on biodiversity is greater than the average
impact calculated by the methodology the qualitative analysis can take account of characteristics that are specific
to the location if for example companies in a particular sector use a lot of water it is important for them to have a
good policy on water consumption




                                                                                                                                  21

                                                                                                         asn bank report 2016

the qualitative analysis

   clarifies how to interpret the results of the footprint
   helps determine a strategy to reduce the impact on biodiversity
   clarifies where improvement of the methodology is possible and necessary
   helps make further refinements to the methodology in the years to come


collaboration on biodiversity
the process of reaching this longterm biodiversity goal has proven to be just as important as the formulation and
fleshing out of the goal itself it is a process of collaboration discussion and inspiration experts share their
thoughts on the scientific basis the government shares its thoughts from the perspective of policy frameworks
civil society organisations and other financial institutions share their thoughts on putting the ideas into practice
that is important because much more will change if other financial institutions also start measuring their impact on
biodiversity and integrating it into their decisionmaking fortunately this collaboration enjoys broad support as the
following three examples demonstrate


expert meeting
the process of developing our longterm goal involved consulting experts in the field of biodiversity on various
occasions we shared and tested the results at a stakeholder meeting with knowledge institutions government
authorities and civil society organisations this resulted in valuable contributions to the development of the
longterm goal leading in particular to inspiring discussions about and views on asn banks role in the area of
biodiversity


cop finc
in the last two years twelve financial institutions worked together in the community of practice financial institutions
and natural capital cop finc asn bank was one of the founders of this community inspired in this regard by our
earlier participation in the cop business  companies alongside such diverse companies as heineken tata steel
and leven op daken asn bank was the only financial institution to take part in this community

participants shared their experiences and insights regarding the role of biodiversity in their investment and finance
policies discussing such topics as what is biodiversity how do you measure biodiversity and can you
achieve a positive impact on biodiversity and achieve returns following the successful completion of this cop
finc the cop finc is being launched at european level in 2017


platform biodiversity accounting financials pbaf
most companies have a direct negative or positive impact on biodiversity or are directly dependent on it the
relationship between a financial institution and nature is entirely different which is why we wish to engage with
other financial institutions too

it starts with the methodology in early 2017 we aim to survey compare and refine the methodologies for
calculating the ecological footprints of financial institutions this is being carried out jointly with actiam
coorganiser and aif manager of the asn investment funds consultancy firm crem and pré consultants a firm
specialising in life cycle analysis

we also aim to survey the methodologies together with experts and a number of frontrunners from the financial
sector the participating financial institutions will determine the agenda with substantive support being provided
by the experts the name of the platform is the platform biodiversity accounting financials pbaf


innovative financing mechanisms for biodiversity
the european union is working together with china to promote biodiversity seminars and expert meetings are
organised under the banner of innovative financing mechanisms for biodiversity in china on 23 november at the
eus invitation asn bank talked about the financial sectors role in biodiversity we addressed the methodology
that we have developed to measure the impact of our investments on biodiversity and also dealt with the financial
sectors role in the area of biodiversity




                                                                                                                                22

natural capital conference
on 24 november we gave a talk in the hague during the natural capital conference this conference which was
organised by the platform biodiversity ecosystems  economy platform bee is a dutch initiative in which
companies nature organisations and scientists work together to protect and restore biodiversity and ecosystems
we talked about our methodology for measuring our ecological footprint and about the role of the financial sector
in the area of biodiversity




                                                                                                                           23

sustainability policy
our mission is shaped in our sustainability policy which is based on the definition of sustainability used in the 1987
un report our common future this report was the first to call for sustainable development defining this concept
as follows development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs

the sustainability policy applies to

   all of asn banks loans and investments
   the asn investment funds asn beleggingsinstellingen beheer bv abb the director of
    asn beleggingsfondsen nv and the manager of asnnovib microkredietfonds and
    asn groenprojectenfonds has adopted these sustainability criteria in full as the basis for its investment policy
   asn vermogensbeheer bvs investments
   the selection of sponsored projects projects for the asn bank world award and other activities

de volksbank
in 2016 de volksbank decided to adopt our sustainability policy as the starting point for the sustainability policy
that it is to formulate in the context of the structural contribution it wants to make to society

the sustainability policy has three pillars human rights climate change and biodiversity the principles underlying
the policy for each pillar are described below


human rights
asn bank subscribes to the view that human rights are universal values they apply everywhere always and to
everyone giving paramount importance to justice freedom and equality human rights serve to protect the human
dignity of all our interpretation of human rights includes every type of human rights civil rights political rights and
economic social and cultural rights in our view a liveable climate and clean environment are also conditions for a
dignified life

human rights protect people against abuse of power by governments which may take the form of discrimination
privacy violations and torture human rights also impose obligations on governments for example the obligations
to provide education and healthcare freedom of speech and equal treatment human rights are laid down in
international conventions

companies too have the responsibility of respecting human rights for example by safeguarding instead of
violating the rights of employees consumers and local residents

the foundations of our human rights policy are the universal declaration of human rights and the international
standards based on it we are also referring here to the guiding principles on business  human rights adopted
by the un human rights council in june 2011 these principles are based on the work performed by the american
professor john ruggie as the uns special representative of the secretarygeneral the ruggie guiding principles
have been incorporated in our human rights policy paper which includes strict criteria for assessing companies
countries and institutions


climate change
the earths climate has changed regularly throughout its history the current change is primarily due to the
activities of man global warming is attributable to greenhouse gas emissions

adaptation
the consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly visible as further global warming is unavoidable
it looks as if it is already too late to solve the climate change problem completely that is an important fact shaping
asn banks climate change policy after all it means that adaptation is inevitable in other words our climate
change policy must include dealing with the consequences of climate change such as drought flooding and loss
of biodiversity that is why we want to help limit the  now unavoidable  consequences of climate change




                                                                                                                                    24

                                                                                                       asn bank report 2016

mitigation
mitigation is necessary as well preventing temperatures from continuing to rise thus limiting the climate change
problem after all curbing the rise in temperatures increases the options for adaptation and may possibly prevent
further dangerous climate change mitigation and adaptation are thus strongly interrelated we contribute as much
as possible to maintaining a safe liveable and stable climate for people and nature in this regard

activities
how do we accomplish this we favour loans to and investment in activities that have low greenhouse gas
emissions and companies that save energy by means of engagement we urge companies in the asn investment
universe to improve their climate performance at shareholders meetings of the companies in which the
asn investment funds invest we vote for company measures to improve their climate performance for a
relationship between remuneration and climate performance and for the implementation of adaptation measures

we are also working on our climate change policy by promoting climatesaving measures among all sorts of target
groups as an advocate we participate in national and international forums such as the cdp formerly the carbon
disclosure project and the united nations environment programme finance initiative unep fi


biodiversity
asn banks biodiversity policy  adopted in 2010  describes how we as a bank hope to contribute to maintaining
and strengthening biodiversity and ecosystems it includes a description of the biodiversity investment criteria that
we apply when selecting loans and investments which are in line with the definition given in the convention on
biological diversity cbd of 1992 the variability among living organisms from all sources including inter alia
terrestrial marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part this includes
diversity within species between species and of ecosystems

we also pursue the objective formulated in the cbd the conservation of biological diversity the sustainable use
of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic
resources

to protect and enhance biodiversity our investment criteria are geared towards the threats to biodiversity thus
placing the impact perspective centre stage according to the millennium ecosystem assessment ma the key
threats to biodiversity are land use change loss of natural habitat climate change invasive alien species
overexploitation and pollution

asn bank selects companies and institutions for financing and investment that contribute to the protection or
improvement of biodiversity they take effective measures or develop activities to prevent or compensate for the
threats referred to above

based on our biodiversity policy we avoid activities that have a major adverse impact on biodiversity such as fossil
fuels mining unsustainable fishery and agriculture this alone keeps our ecological footprint small but we also
want to make a positive contribution to nature and the diversity of species within it our longterm goal for
biodiversity reflects this endeavour to achieve this goal we have to reduce our negative impact while increasing
our positive impact


policy changes in 2016
our sustainability policy is laid down in policy papers in 2016 the practical guide to the research process the
guide  asn sustainability criteria was revised and expanded for example our policy on tobacco was finetuned
and the following policy changes were included in the guide  asn sustainability criteria

animal welfare
we refined the animal welfare policy on two points the testing of cosmetics on animals was formerly an exclusion
criterion while it is still the case that we do not permit cosmetic animal testing we have now introduced an
exception for when the company is legally obliged to do so as in china the company does need to have a vision
on reducing animal testing and investing in alternative test methods

we also amended the criterion on the trade in and use of fur leather and feathers while we still exclude
companies that produce use or trade in fur hides or pelts from exotic and protected species we no longer assess
companies in terms of whether they use leather as a byproduct we have replaced this with the criterion that
companies must not make any use of products obtained from animals kept in appalling conditions this may apply
to for instance leather angora wool down and feathers


                                                                                                                              25

                                                                                                        asn bank report 2016

period of review
up until 2015 it was our goal to review every company and institution in the universe within three years as from
2016 we extended that period to four years our reasons for doing so are that companies have become more
transparent and nowadays information about their sustainability is more easily and rapidly accessible we
continuously monitor whether any misconduct is taking place at companies in order to know at a much earlier
stage whether something is wrong with a company if such monitoring gives cause to bring the review forward we
will

game changers
in 2016 we adjusted our selection policy in respect of game changers companies that play a distinct important
role in making society more sustainable we can now approve such companies on two conditions they have good
policy on key points and they demonstrate that they engage in good practice the first game changer that we
approved was tesla motors

government bonds
the selection of government bonds has changed until recently we began by assessing countries based on the
exclusion criteria and then selected the countries issuing eurobonds these countries were then ranked on the
basis of sustainability criteria in 2016 this order was changed following assessment against exclusion criteria
selection takes place on the basis of sustainability criteria and then the fund manager selects the countries that
issue eurobonds this change affects the scores and ranking of the countries


sustainability instruments
we execute our sustainability policy using three instruments whose application is based on our sustainability
criteria each of the instruments is used according to a standard procedure

selection
we select loans companies institutions and national governments based on our sustainability criteria

engagement
we engage with companies and institutions in which the asn investment funds invest or that are eligible for
inclusion in the asn investment universe on the subject of their sustainability

the selection process is executed for both the investments of asn bank and the investments and loans of the
asn investment funds it is one of the key procedures that we use to implement asn banks mission it is an
intensive and thorough process that takes place according to a standard procedure we continuously verify
whether investments and loans meet our sustainability criteria in that process we use information provided by
companies or countries specialised research institutes the media and ngos

the asn selection committee discusses assessments after completion and is advised by the sustainability 
research department the asn selection committee discusses assessments after completion and is advised by
the sustainability  research department the asn selection committee is the only body that has the power to
approve or disapprove a company government or institution for the asn investment universe abb is part of the
asn selection committee and decides on admission to the asn investment funds universe companies
institutions and national governments that meet our sustainability criteria are approved they are admitted to the
asn investment universe from this selection the asset managers of the asn investment funds the managers

the asn selection committee met six times in 2016 we analysed 254 companies in total 31 of which were
assessed for two or three funds we also evaluated 199 countries in connection with government bond
investments

 eight companies have different statuses in different funds they were for example maintained in a fund and newly
admitted to another fund

here are some examples of companies that we either approved or disapproved

approved unilever
the dutch multinational unilever is a sustainability frontrunner in the food and household items sectors while
unilevers sustainability policy is good misconduct regularly occurs in practice in relation to labour rights at
suppliers consumer protection and the use of nonsustainable palm oil we have spoken to the persons
responsible at the company they acknowledge that they have not yet succeeded in ridding the company of all
misconduct but are confident that unilever is taking good precautionary measures to safeguard its policy for
example by means of management systems monitoring and a reporting obligation

approved tesla
tesla motors sustainability vision is excellent it is bringing sustainability changes to the car market as well as
innovating the solar energy market consequently its impact on sustainable development is considerable it is a
game changer before we approved tesla we had contact with the company regarding such matters as consumer
protection including car safety and communication regarding defects teslas responses were sufficient it is fully
transparent and attaches importance to the safety of its cars

disapproved dsm
the dutch company dsm operates in the field of energy and biomaterials it distinguishes itself with sustainable
innovation for example with products for solar cells and organic products however one of dsms divisions dsm
dyneema produces a fibre that is incorporated into military vehicles and military clothing as armour as a result the
fibre falls within our definition of arms


engagement
on behalf of abb the sustainability  research department of asn bank engages with companies in which the
asn investment funds invest when we conduct engagement we engage in dialogue with companies and
institutions for the purpose of making them more aware of their sustainability performance and to urge them to
improve it the engagement decision is taken in the following cases

if we suspect that a company in the asn investment universe no longer meets our investment criteria we will
contact the company about this if the desired response is not obtained the asn selection committee decides
whether the company should be removed from the universe

asn duurzaam small  midcapfonds invests part of its funds in small companies their activities meet our
sustainability criteria they have policy in place for the issues that expose them to high risks and there is no known
serious misconduct however these companies do not always have sufficient policy on issues that expose them to
lower risks we use active dialogue to press for improvement and to encourage companies to develop policy on
other issues too

companies appreciate it if they are selected for our universe we encourage them by informing them of their
admission where possible

in 2016 we engaged with 43 companies we contacted diverse companies in response to certain indications for
example we spoke with heineken in response to the book heineken in africa by olivier van beemen the book
refers to several instances of misconduct in relation to the payment of taxes in africa marketing practices and
healthy and safe working conditions on the basis of our discussion with heineken about the misconduct we
concluded that the accusations could not be related to current practice the same holds true for the marketing
practices because heineken did not seem to be in conflict with our criteria it retained our approval




                                                                                                                                          27

                                                                                                                asn bank report 2016

voting
the asn investment funds are entitled to vote at shareholders meetings of the companies in which they invest
the funds cast their votes according to the mission and sustainability criteria of asn bank and
asn beleggingsinstellingen beheer bv abb

voting in 2016
number of companies where votes were cast                                                                          162
number of shareholders meetings where votes were cast                                                             177
number of companies in which the asn investment funds invested at yearend 2016                                    176
 these figures are different because some companies held several shareholders meetings we also voted at meetings of
companies that were no longer included in the fund portfolio at the end of the year also we did not vote at meetings of
companies that were not yet included in the fund portfolio at the time they held their shareholders meetings


here are a few examples of our voting at shareholders meetings

starbucks
during starbucks shareholders meeting in march we voted against a shareholder proposal from the national
center for public policy research ncpp the ncpp asked starbucks to be more transparent on its human rights
policy the ncpp is known as a conservative organisation which among other things denies that the problem of
climate change exists we were concerned that the ncpp would misuse starbucks transparency to impede
change in the area of human rights its proposal received a mere 4 percent of the votes cast

edp renováveis
renewable energy companies play an important role in the transition to a sustainable society but at such
companies too management can sometimes be inadequate for example in april we voted against the
remuneration policy of edp renováveis the reasons being that the policy was not linked to sustainability objectives
and there was a lack of transparency

sustainability in annual reports
we apply separate guidelines when voting on annual reports paying special attention to human rights climate
change and biodiversity these issues were handled remarkably well in the reports of marks and spencer group
ds smith plc and addtech ab consequently we voted in favour of all three of these reports in the third quarter


engagement with the pharmaceutical industry
medicines are essential for responsible healthcare which means that pharmaceutical companies are indispensable
to human health and welfare it follows that the pharmaceutical industry is part of a sustainable society
asn duurzaam aandelenfonds invests in pharmaceutical companies whose sustainability policy meets our
sustainability criteria however we are regularly confronted with ethical misconduct in practice which indicates that
the responsible policy of pharmaceutical companies does not always lead to responsible practices we engage in
intensive dialogue with pharmaceutical companies to tackle misconduct


report from policy to practice
commissioned by asn bank the report from policy to practice by the sustainalytics research agency was
published in february 2016 the agency researched the worlds fifteen largest pharmaceutical companies the key
conclusions confirmed our experiences the research shows that pharmaceutical companies often have sound
safety quality and integrity policies that comply with the applicable laws and rules however these companies
regularly make the news on account of corruption aggressive marketing techniques and defective products
according to sustainalytics one of the reasons for this is that most pharmaceutical companies lack robust integrity
management internal supervisory procedures do exist but their application is inadequate sometimes they are
lacking altogether as a consequence there is insufficient supervision of research into and the development
manufacture marketing and sale of medicines all this has adverse consequences for patients


principles of engagement
in 2015 our engagement commenced with discussions with two pharmaceutical companies in our investment
universe the british businesses astrazeneca and glaxosmithkline gsk we added novo nordisk denmark and
novartis switzerland in 2016 we attend these four pharmaceutical companies shareholders meetings and ask
questions there and we talk with directors and sustainability officers



                                                                                                                                       28

                                                                                                        asn bank report 2016

raising incidents is expressly not our approach as in our experience that does not work our approach is to assess
how well pharmaceutical companies implement their policy in practice if there is room for improvement we
discuss this with the company concerned the key question during these discussions is how does the company
put its policy into practice in order to prevent misconduct the discussions focus on four areas contributing to
consumer protection

   ethical conduct how does the company deal with corruption and bribery how has ethical conduct been
    embedded in its operations
   executive and sales staff remuneration how and on which aspects are they appraised and rewarded
   responsible marketing how does the company ensure that medicines are marketed for the right purposes and
    in an honest way
   safe medicines does the company ensure that the medicines are safe for consumers by means of responsible
    test procedures manufacturing and distribution


activities in 2016
in january we sent the report from policy to practice to the fifteen pharmaceutical companies dealt with this
formed the basis for questions that we posed during the shareholders meetings and for discussions with the
management of the four companies with which we conduct engagement in 2016 we also focused on the
remuneration of sales staff and transparency regarding payments to healthcare professionals

astrazeneca
on 29 april 2016 we attended astrazenecas shareholders meeting the following emerged from answers given
and discussions with management astrazeneca publishes its payments to healthcare professionals in europe and
the united states it aims to chart its contact with healthcare professionals throughout the world astrazeneca was
pleased to receive a copy of our vision on a good remuneration policy for sales staff the board of directors gave
consideration to our request to publish the framework for the remuneration policy astrazeneca also indicated that
our vision and feedback had been taken into account in determining a new strategy and materiality analysis

glaxosmithkline
in response to the report glaxosmithkline gsk asked us to share our vision on the remuneration policy for sales
staff we did so at the shareholders meeting on 5 may 2016 and on other occasions with effect from 2016 gsk
has stopped making payments to healthcare professionals for promotional purposes the only payments it still
makes to these professionals are for educational purposes it publishes these payments in certain countries
including all those in europe gsk no longer pays its sales staff and marketing representatives on the basis of
individual sales targets their remuneration is based on their technical knowledge the quality of the service they
provide to healthcare professionals and various commercial results

novartis
at the shareholders meeting of 23 february 2016 and during our visit on 18 november 2016 we called attention to
remuneration and the related transparency over the past year novartis has put measures in place to embed
ethical conduct in the company more effectively and to prevent and resolve misconduct issues novartis no longer
pays healthcare professionals for promotional purposes since 2016 novartis has reported according to the rules
of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations efpia on payments to healthcare
professionals in europe however the results have not yet been published

novartis made even more progress in 2016 as the following new measures demonstrate board remuneration has
been made partly dependent on objectives related to quality and safety novartis investigates incidents related to
the promotion of medicines and takes corrective action sales staff are paid according to the quality of their service

novo nordisk
on 18 april 2016 we attended novo nordisks shareholders meeting we also conducted several discussions with
the company novo nordisk has taken steps to prevent misconduct as a result the number of incidents of
misconduct has in any event not risen this year the aim is for it to decrease with effect from 2017 novo nordisk
aims to report on misconduct and on the countermeasures taken by the company novo nordisk publishes its
payments to healthcare professionals in the united states and europe these reports are available on the
companys local websites in the national language concerned finally novo nordisk has included ethical conduct
in the criteria that determine sales staffs remuneration board remuneration has been made partly dependent on
performance related to quality and safety




                                                                                                                               29

                                                                                                        asn bank report 2016

inspiration and progress
we hope that our engagement programme will inspire other financial institutions to ask pharmaceutical companies
similarly critical questions we also commenced collaboration with other investors in 2016 for example in 2017 we
will be conducting the discussions with astrazeneca gsk and novo nordisk together with robeco

in 2018 we will be issuing a second report with sustainalytics on the question of whether progress is evident at the
pharmaceutical companies in the meantime we are keeping abreast of developments and keeping a close eye on
the four pharmaceutical companies commitments

                                                   customer base




the growth of our customer base is mainly attributable to the inflow of people opening current accounts most of
whom were not existing customers

one of our strategic objectives is to have 1 million customers in 2025 bearing that in mind the increase in the
number of customers was not to our satisfaction we have initiated changes to enable more growth in the next few
years in this respect we are expressly seeking to attract a new younger target group developing new products
and making it easier for people to become customers


becoming a customer
to promote successful growth we are making it as easy as possible for people to become customers we have
already streamlined this process in recent years and continued to improve it this year for example since april
customers may identify themselves at postnl offices of which there are approximately 750 we also gave
customers the option of scanning the documents needed to open an account and sending them by email instead of
by post approximately 80 percent of new customers availed themselves of this option


general banking terms and conditions
the general banking terms and conditions gbtc  with basic rules governing the relationship between the
customer and the bank  have been simplified clarified and amended this was done in close consultation with the
dutch banking association nvb the dutch consumers association and employers organisations the gbtc
have been written in plainer more comprehensible dutch with examples for clarification the amended gbtc take
effect on 1 march 2017

customer satisfaction
customer satisfaction is an important principle underpinning our services we put our customers interests first our
services are focused on people instead of processes we listen to our customers take their complaints seriously
and admit mistakes

the customer satisfaction survey conducted by de volksbank revealed that our customers gave us a rating of 80
at the end of 2016 yearend 2015 81 our goal is to receive at least 8 points

last summer the dutch consumers association published the outcomes of its survey into banks customer service
asn bank did not emerge favourably from this article we take the outcomes seriously and have sent the dutch
consumers association the following response we are shocked by the outcome of the survey the expertise of
our customer service staff is important to asn bank and to our customers we are grateful to the dutch consumers
association for this survey because it will keep us vigilant the outcome clearly indicates the areas that we need to
work on and that is exactly what we are going to do


net promoter score
the net promoter score nps reflects the degree to which customers recommend a particular service provider or
supplier to calculate this score customers are asked what is the likelihood on a scale from 0 to 10 that you will
recommend this company to family friends or colleagues then the percentage of customers giving 0 to 6 is
deducted from the percentage of customers giving 9 or 10 this means that the nps can be either positive or
negative

customer satisfaction decreased the nps remained virtually stable throughout the entire year at 15 asn bank
achieved an nps of 14 for the last quarter of 2016 as against 19 at the end of 2015 our target for 2016 was an
nps of 22 in 2016 we implemented various improvements in our services to enhance satisfaction particularly
with regard to payments improving the service remains a focal point in 2017


service
integrity transparency expertise and reliability are paramount in our customer interaction we offer
easytounderstand banking products and good service and communicate clearly about this we distinguish
between retail customers and corporate clients whom we offer various services

   retail payments savings investments asset management

asn bank is an online bank we have no offices to provide customer service that is why the quality of our
customer service department and online services are vital to customer satisfaction


asn       customer service department
our customers can take their questions and comments to the staff of the asn customer service department they
dealt with over 286000 phone calls we reduced the waiting times for customers calling us to an average of 44
seconds conversations with customers lasted an average of almost four and a half minutes aside from telephone
calls the asn customer service department handled more than 110000 emails and approximately 5000 letters

a large proportion of customers questions concerned their accounts for example relating to online banking
transfer orders contra account changes and activating the asn wereldpas the asn customer service
department helped over 5000 people transfer their current account to asn bank the surviving dependants desk
helped around 4100 surviving dependants of account holders we opened a contact point for family members of
missing persons


webcare
webcare is another important way of providing customer service we actively monitor message traffic on facebook
and twitter answering questions there about our services and products and about the bank in general this
service is correlated with our active social media presence




                                                                                                                                 34

                                                                                                         asn bank report 2016

online and mobile banking
of the more than 645000 customers over 430000 customers organise their banking affairs digitally via
asn online banking of the online customers 121000 use mobile banking via the asn mobile banking app the
number of app users increased by 25 percent the app is particularly popular among customers who actively
engage in online banking 42 percent of them use the app app users log in far more frequently than customers
who use online banking alone 61 percent of digital sessions in 2016 were mobile 42 percent of all transactions
were executed via the app that was more than via online banking


improvements to services
we recorded various welcome videos in 2015 especially for new customers this year we added howto videos
that show ease of payment the app making ideal payments using the qr code making payments without the
identifier digipas the switching service customer insight into and overview of all his or her accounts and
monthly investing the videos have now been viewed by tens of thousands of customers

we introduced straightthrough processing for various paymentrelated processes because there are no longer
any administrative activities changes made by customers via online banking or the mobile app can take effect
immediately these changes consist of activating or deactivating contactless payment and payment outside the
eurozone and temporary payment limit increases

in late 2016 we implemented a number of new services in the asn mobile banking app the main new feature
allows customers to log in using their fingerprint if their device permits them to do so another new feature was the
balance chart which shows balance movements during the month in 2015 we introduced the cash book function
in the app we were unable to execute our plan to make this function available for online banking as well in 2016
the online cash book will follow in 2017

the sepa guidelines for european direct debits were amended at the end of november one of the changes is that
customers may refuse a scheduled direct debit before the money is debited from their account instead of only
afterwards


information security
the security of banking with asn bank is our prime consideration we meet the strict security standards of the joint
dutch banks we devote extensive attention on our website to cybercrime in order to warn customers about it and
make them resistant to it

in 2016 cybercriminals targeted our customers in increasingly smart and advanced ways they attempted to obtain
customer login data via friendly telephone calls and polite emails resulting in a slight increase in account fraud on
the other hand bank card skimming at pointofsale terminals has declined considerably the explanation being that
the option to use the asn wereldpas outside of europe is disabled as standard


disruptions and availability
there were fewer payment system disruptions in 2016 than in previous years however just as in 2015 the
disruptions were again more severe they lasted for longer periods of time and occurred almost without exception
in the payment system this meant that when disruptions did occur many of our customers were inconvenienced
the availability of asn online banking was not lower than the target of 990 percent in prime time from monday to
saturday inclusive from 7 am to 1 am and on sundays and national holidays from 8 am to 1 am in any month


communication
to enable us to grow to one million satisfied customers by 2025 we have made an important strategic decision in
addition to our existing base of loyal idealsdriven customers we are focusing on a younger target group
research has shown that there are many young welleducated optimistic people who make sustainable choices
but without having the idealistic approach of the older generation banking with a sustainable bank is an easy
sustainable option for these young people which is why we have developed a new advertising campaign and
communication strategy to appeal to them its essence is showing that you can use money to promote sustainable
progress while generating a good return at the same time we aim to make sustainable banking accessible and
attractive accessible by continuing to offer clear and easytounderstand products attractive by demonstrating that
banking with asn bank contributes to sustainable development and so has the feelgood factor




                                                                                                                                35

                                                                                                        asn bank report 2016

these choices also mean that we have moved on from the activistic idealistic attitude that had long characterised
our communications with customers ideals for the future are giving way to sustainable progress right now we no
longer wish to be seen as an activist sustainability organisation but to explain how we as a bank are contributing
to sustainable progress in a positive way


website
the website asnbanknl plays a central role in our services to and communication with customers on 3 november
the website underwent a facelift the design was updated with more white space a new font and new illustrations
this is the visual expression of our new communication approach it makes the website far clearer and more
modern in appearance we have begun preparations to make the website responsive in 2017 so that it is clearly
legible on tablets and mobile telephones too


social media
social media such as facebook twitter and linkedin play a prominent role in our communications we post
positive news items about the sustainable society or asn bank itself on an almost daily basis prompting numerous
positive responses at the end of 2016 we had over 46000 followers on facebook 14000 on twitter and more
than 3700 on linkedin in 2016 we received almost 30000 tweets 8000 less than in 2015 these consisted of
responses to our tweets questions via twitter retweets and direct messages in total we received more than 2200
compliments and more than 2100 negative messages andor complaints via twitter and on facebook our
webcare department responds to complaints in consultation with the asn customer service department and
other bank departments such as sustainability  research depending on the substance of the complaint


meetings
we set great store by personal communication twoway inspiration and engagement which is why we regularly
organise meetings to meet our customers

we organised asn live on two occasions in maastricht on 16 february we spoke with customers and other guests
about paris climate agreement what next one of the speakers was the attorney roger cox who successfully
sued the dutch state in the climate case that he conducted on behalf of urgenda

on 8 june asn live took place in amersfoort on the theme of the influence of your money the programme
devoted attention to local sustainability initiatives and crowdfunding as well as to exerting influence via investment
in large companies such companies were represented by geanne van arkel head of sustainable development at
interface a sustainable carpet manufacturer

our annual customer meeting tomorrowtoday was transformed in 2016 into a wellattended sustainability festival
it took place on saturday 24 september in utrechts metaal kathedraal the opening speaker was the congolese
gynaecologist and human rights activist denis mukwege the numerous other speakers included liesbeth zegveld
attorney and professor of war reparations ruben terlou documentary maker photographer and doctor and jan
terlouw writer and politician the guests could also set to work by generating solar energy themselves for
example those present rated the day 83 points out of 10


from paper to digital
more and more of our communication takes place digitally thus accommodating the wishes of our customers and
reducing the amount of paper used our customer magazine ideaal was issued four times in 2016 both in hard
copy and online the number of online subscribers to ideaal online grew from 18000 to 94000 due in part to a
number of campaigns the readership of the hard copy magazine declined by 66000 as from 2017 the magazine
primarily appears online and under a new name goedgeld good money  a name that suits our new
communication approach the email newsletter was published eleven times we expanded our reach by more than
100000 addresses to more than 300000 customers

digital first also applied to asn banks report in 2015 it was published primarily online for the first time the
annual reports of the asn investment funds and asn foundation are likewise available online but have also been

social impact

we foster sustainable progress by taking initiatives and participating in platforms in the context of our sustainability
pillars  human rights climate change and biodiversity we also take part in debates on other issues affecting our
mission during the events that we organise and on other occasions the starting point in those debates is that we
wish to offer our discussion partners a perspective for action

contribution to each others objectives and thus enhance our effectiveness our partners are primarily ngos


sustainability issues
sustainability is a fairly abstract concept in order to make this concept more tangible and specific for current and
prospective customers the focus of our communications on sustainability in recent years has been on five
sustainability issues fair trade antichild labour renewable energy antiarms and care  welfare with effect from
2017 we are focusing our communications on the manner in which we promote sustainable progress in the
framework of the three pillars of our sustainability policy human rights climate change and biodiversity

government to vote in favour of the un resolution to start negotiations on a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons in
2017 although the government did not vote in favour it abstained from voting while the other nato countries
voted against


fostering sustainability initiatives
our online platform for the world of tomorrow encourages people with smart ideas for a more sustainable world

inspiration via blogs on all sorts of initiatives that contribute to a more sustainable world which often provide a
perspective for action we support the blogs with social media publicity

30000 visitors compared to 2015 in 2016 248 new approved projects were launched

the two main activities that the platform developed in 2016 to stimulate sustainability initiatives were crowdfunding
for the world of tomorrow and the asn bank world award


crowdfunding for the world of tomorrow
we launched crowdfunding for the world of tomorrow on 15 december 2015 it offered project owners the option
of obtaining funding an additional level of support and commitment  on top of the online communitys support
this aligned well with the objectives of both asn bank and for the world of tomorrow




                                                                                                                              39

                                                                                                        asn bank report 2016

the crowdfunding was a partnership between for the world of tomorrow and the crowdfunding platform
oneplanetcrowd for the world of tomorrow attracted the projects and saw to additional publicity around the
crowdfunding campaign while oneplanetcrowd provided the platform the experts from oneplanetcrowd
assessed the plans and selected the participating projects asn bank assessed the projects on the basis of its
sustainability criteria the participating project owners received personal coaching to help them conduct a
successful campaign

more than 125 entrepreneurs registered six of whom were selected by oneplanetcrowd and asn bank for the
crowdfunding process voorleesexpress sweet heroes kantoorkaravaan chef het samen sprinklr and kartent

used at festivals in the netherlands and abroad belgium sweden germany and south africa in the words of jan
portheine our highlights over the past year were definitely made possible by our crowdfunding and the help from

asn       bank world award
we believe that innovation comes from society which is why for the world of tomorrow has organised the
asn bank world award since 2009 our award helps promising projects to grow projects of enterprising people
with smart ideas for a better world the award is geared towards initiators whose idealism is coupled with a healthy
dose of realism and business acumen

each project has to fit in with one of the awards five issues asn bank world award participants are in with a
chance of winning a programme of coaching training and publicity the five finalists can win a sum of between
5000 and 20000 euros there is also a public award of a maximum of 5000 euros

we started the asn bank world award 2016 with no fewer than 330 registrations a record in the history of the
award after an initial selection fifty projects remained various rounds then took place in which the jury 
comprising entrepreneurs and specialists in the sustainability field  selected the best two projects per issue in the
last round the jury assessed the project owners business plans pitches and presentations and conducted
discussions with them

the jury was chaired by ynzo van zanten economist entrepreneur and initiator of green inc in his view the
submissions were of a high level the growing interest in the asn bank world award led to good submissions in
every category this shows that  without many people being aware of it  new entrepreneurs are coming forward
who are really helping society to advance it is wonderful that the asn bank world award gives further assistance
to these entrepreneurs and offers them a platform

payments
a current account forms the basis for a longterm intensive relationship with customers certainly when they also
save andor invest at asn bank that is why we are focusing for the next few years on attracting and retaining
these active customers and on developing new products and services we offer our customers current accounts
with low charges interest on positive balances and relatively low overdraft interest following the introduction of
the asn juniorrekening we offer a full range of retail current accounts we also offer selfemployed persons a
current account tailored to their needs

the charges for the asn bank account and the asn betalen zelfstandigen account did not increase in 2016 and
are also remaining the same in 2017 the asn juniorrekening and asn jongerenrekening are free of charge


new asn                             juniorrekening
on 17 may we introduced the free asn juniorrekening for children between six and twelve years of age the
account allows children to become familiar with everyday banking in a childfriendly safe way they can make
purchases and withdraw money with their own debit card but with restrictions they can use the asn mobile
banking app to see how much money they have in their account their parents manage the account via online or
mobile banking by the end of 2016 more than 4600 asn juniorrekening accounts had already been opened




                                                                                                                                 41

campaigns
we conducted various successful campaigns for our current accounts in may and june we conducted a campaign
with the motto for a sustainable current account that pays interest on your balance you need look no further than
the bank with the best score in the fair bank guide we also used this campaign to draw attention to our savings
accounts

in the runup to the new school year we ran a campaign for the asn juniorrekening and asn jongerenrekening
accounts the child or young person received 15 euros on their account upon opening an account and activating
their debit card

starting from 28 november we offered the asn bank account and asn credit card free of charge for a period of
six months the pocket money campaign for the asn juniorrekening and asn jongerenrekening is also being
continued we strengthened this promotional activity with the first campaign in the new asn bank style how
money can buy happiness the new style is directed towards a broader target group the style is more accessible
and optimistic making it clear that a little bit of goodness is good too everyone makes sustainable choices in their
own way we began disseminating this message on 28 november via station posters adverts radio online video
display banners and facebook

source statistics netherlands


the drop was mainly caused by low interest rates which rendered it financially more favourable for many
customers to redeem their residential mortgage and to fund renovations than to save money also flowed to
asn optimaalbeleggen because customers expect a higher return from the asn investment funds than from their
savings account money also flowed into other financial institutions savings accounts offering a higher rate of
interest the low interest rates were a frequently recurring topic of discussion at the asn customer service
department and on social media we explained the causes on a separate page on our website to which we
referred in the email messages that customers receive upon every interest rate adjustment

feeling the pressure of the low general interest rate level asn bank had to amend the terms and conditions of the
asn sparen zakelijk savings account as from 1 october reducing the savings balance on which customers receive
interest from a maximum of 5 million to a maximum of 25 million euros this led to a significant outflow of savings


sustainable savings market
in 2015 the market for sustainable savings contracted for the first time in years specifically by 22 percent as
reported by the dutch association of investors for sustainable development vbdo in the autumn this was not in
line with the total dutch savings market which grew by 41 percent in 2015 the sustainable savings market share
thereby comprised 4 percent of the total dutch savings market in 2015 the figures for 2016 will be known at the
end of 2017


amendment to deposit terms and conditions
in order to encourage sustainable living we extended the terms and conditions for withdrawing money from the
asn depositosparen savings account with effect from june withdrawals may be made free of charge if the
amount withdrawn is used for sustainable renovations of the customers own home in this way we are
encouraging energysaving measures such as insulation highefficiency glazing and boilers heat pumps and solar
panels

for the first time the presentation took place on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the gouden spaarrente
award spaarrentenl wrote the following about asn jeugdsparen this account offered the highest interest rate
throughout the entire year which fell by a mere 02 percentage points during that period while interest rates on
youth savings accounts fell by an average of 04 percentage points from january up to and including december
2016

there was a net rise of 3164 in the number of asn jeugdsparen accounts deposits grew by 96 percent to 321
million euros using this savings account our customers invest in the future of their children and grandchildren and
the future of many children who are less fortunate as we donate an annual amount to cordaid and nationaal fonds
kinderhulp on behalf of customers with an asn jeugdsparen account the donation in 2016 totalled 391578 euros
since the start of asn jeugdsparen in 2002 we have donated more than 32 million euros for vulnerable children

euros the number of customers with an investment account rose by 5744 to 82797

the funds growth was due in particular to the inflow of new monies this inflow was in part fuelled by historically
low interest rates on savings and the recognisable sustainability profile of the funds the inflow of new money
came from customers of both asn bank and of other banks offering the asn investment funds

sustainable investment market
the demand for sustainable investment funds is on the rise the dutch association of investors for sustainable
development vbdo established that the total sustainable investment market grew by 306 percent in 2015 from
115 billion to 151 billion euros the sustainable investment market share thereby comprised 13 percent of the total
market of 1157 billion euros the figures for 2016 will be known at the end of 2017


campaign
asn bank conducted a campaign for the asn investment funds in the first half of 2016 working closely with
oxfam novib in this respect as 2016 marked the 25th year of collaboration between asn bank and oxfam novib
the bank donated 5 euros to oxfam novib for every deposit of 2000 euros or more in the asn investment funds
oxfam novib used this money to help four hundred women in the mozambican province of nampula to start up
small businesses more than six thousand investors took part in the campaign


stock exchange listing of asn groenprojectenfonds
on 27 january 2016 asn groenprojectenfonds was listed on euronext amsterdam making this fund available to
people who do not have an asn bank investment account


new structure
the listing of asn groenprojectenfonds means that all asn investment funds are now listed on the stock
exchange as a result the legal structure can be simplified in 2016 there were still three structures each with their
own prospectus annual report annual meeting and supervisory board asn beleggingsfondsen nv
asn groenprojectenfonds and asnnovib microkredietfonds in 2016 asn beleggingsinstellingen beheer bv
abb made preparations to bring these under a single overarching structure asn beleggingsfondsen nv the
advantage for unitholders is that they can take part in decision making regarding approval of the annual report the
dividend and appointment of the auditor this merger can result in higher efficiency for the funds




                                                                                                                                 44

asn       groenprojectenfonds temporarily closed
as asn groenprojectenfonds qualifies as a green institution private investors in the fund may obtain a tax
advantage the law imposes the condition on green institutions that at least seventy percent of their actual
activities consist of the financing of recognised green projects there was a great influx of money into
asn groenprojectenfonds in the autumn partly because the tax reference date of 1 january was approaching the
supply of green projects lagged behind as a result the portion of the investment portfolio that was invested in
green projects threatened to be reduced to less than seventy percent consequently we temporarily closed the
fund to new unitholder purchases on 14 november 2016


preparations for asn sustainable mixed funds
in 2016 we prepared to introduce five new sustainable mixed funds the official introduction took place on 10
january 2017 investors can purchase the funds via the websites of asn bank and euronext

asn sustainable mixed funds allow abb to offer investors more control over their capital growth without
demanding much in the way of time knowledge and experience the funds invest in het existing asn investment
universe each fund invests according to a particular allocation between euro government bonds and equities the
risk profiles vary from very defensive to very offensive investors select the risk they are willing to accept to have
the chance of a higher return with the help of an online instrument which provides insight into the investment
options investors can also monitor whether they are achieving their financial goal this tool will become available
during the first quarter of 2017

asset management
asn asset management is intended for private individuals foundations associations and social institutions that
want to outsource the management of their investment portfolios the services are aimed at customers with
investable assets of at least 250000 euros asn asset management invests these assets on the basis of
asn banks sustainability policy

asn asset managements customer base grew modestly in 2016 while assets under management increased by 31
percent partly driven by the turbulent investment year this prompted an overall slight decrease in the value of the
investment portfolios

both the bond and the share portion of the management portfolios underperformed the benchmark for the shares
this was mainly caused by the price rises of the shares we select on the basis of our sustainability criteria not
keeping up with the price rises of nonsustainable shares the value of the bond portfolio was negatively impacted
by the bonds relatively short term to maturity following expectations of limited interest rate hikes

we invest in types of financing that keep financial risks controllable and that are in line with our sustainability
criteria for example in bonds issued by governments that meet our sustainability criteria and in green and social
bonds in 2016 we added more than 135 million euros in bonds


equator principles
the equator principles for large project loans require the loans to meet the social and environmental criteria set by
the international finance corporation ifc asn bank has adopted the equator principles which reaffirms our
policy to provide loans only to projects that are developed in a socially responsible manner and are in line with the
requirements for sound sustainability policies

in addition to our own sustainability criteria we apply the equator principles to all the projects we finance whose
total value exceeds 10 million us dollars we apply the converted amount of 8 million euros as a limit the equator
principles distinguish three project categories ranging from a high possible adverse effect on the environment and
human rights category a to a low effect c

in 2016 we did not provide any loans subject to the equator principles


main loan and investment categories
housing
private residential mortgages are our largest loan and investment category we finance mortgages of our affiliated
brands of de volksbank nv regiobank sns and blg wonen these mortgages meet our sustainability criteria
with this financing we ensure that people can buy a home of their own  as with financing in the social housing
sector

working on climate impact
energy consumption of homes is a major source of co2 emissions in the netherlands within the framework of our
longterm climate change goal we aim to reduce our mortgage portfolios climate impact that is where we have
de volksbank on our side de volksbank too seeks to achieve climate neutrality in all its loans and investments
that is why it wants to make the mortgage portfolio more sustainable for example by adding such sustainability
measures to the homes for which the mortgages were provided that they move from the low energy labels e f and
g to label a or b de volksbank aims to work on this by advising customers and making energysaving measures
financially possible

within this context de volksbank and its brands asn bank sns and blg wonen are the main partners of
slimwonernl the website launched by natuur  milieu in 2015 slimwonernl offers homeowners wellfounded
independent advice on saving energy in and around the house the website alleviates the administrative burden
offering them the option of having insulation work carried out by reliable certified parties group buying allows
slimwonernl to offer fair prices which makes it easy for homeowners to make their homes sustainable the other
two main partners of slimwonernl  hoom and greenchoice  contribute to implementing the sustainability
measures

energy saving loan
asn bank has committed itself to funding the energy saving loan energiebespaarlening of the national energy
saving fund nationaal energiebespaarfonds this loan enables homeowners to finance energysaving measures
inside and outside their homes they repay the loan in seven to fifteen years by monthly instalments




                                                                                                                               48

loans to housing corporations
we provide funding and private loans to housing corporations these corporations have a social objective they
provide good affordable housing specifically for lowincome households they increasingly add environmental
goals to this social objective which makes them eligible for financing by asn bank we assess every individual
housing corporation on compliance with our sustainability criteria


government bonds
the dutch central bank and the european central bank require all banks to maintain part of their assets in readily
marketable investments such as government bonds which are loans extended to countries governments
governments provide basic facilities such as housing education and healthcare and rules to protect nature for
example  matters that are important now and in the sustainable world of tomorrow we only invest in the
government bonds of countries that meet our sustainability criteria as at 31 december we held government bonds
from eight countries germany the netherlands belgium france austria ireland sweden and luxembourg

developments in government bonds
the government bond portfolio declined by over 379 million euros the stakes in the netherlands  273 million
euros france  156 million euros and germany  134 million euros decreased whereas the stakes in belgium 
42 million euros austria  27 million euros and sweden  6 million euros increased the increases and
decreases are the result of purchases and sales of government bonds as well as revaluations new additions to the
portfolio were ireland and luxembourg


local governments
local and regional governments such as municipalities and provinces play an important role in a societys
functioning if we have approved a countrys government bonds based on our sustainability criteria for government
bonds the local governments have also automatically been approved in this category we provide loans to dutch
municipalities and provinces


renewable energy
market conditions in 2016 were even more challenging than in 2015 which was not an easy year either this was
caused by several factors

   there were only a few new projects applying for a loan
   global interest rates dropped further as in 2015 various large projects in the portfolio needed to have their
    loans refinanced as a result of low interest rates and good results in the past project owners could stipulate
    much lower rates
   competition was fierce many banks were interested in the financing of sustainability projects that are also
    financially feasible and insurers and pension funds entered the market
   the increase in the number of large parties operating in the international market for renewable energy projects
    has consequences for the ticket size projects are divided into a smaller number of loans with a higher amount
    per loan large or larger banks often have the advantage on this point the minimum ticket size of projects is
    becoming too high for asn bank

in 2017 too we will continue to seek early cooperation with developers of renewable energy projects we want to
retain our leading role in the shaping of the energy transition which  thankfully  is now widely supported

some of the new loans in the field of renewable energy we provided in 2016 are the following

solar energy centrale photovoltaïque de toulrosières 2 sas
thirty kilometres west of nancy the large 115megawatt solar farm centrale photovoltaïque de toulrosières is
situated on a former military base having previously been provided with a loan the farm received another loan 
totalling 21 million euros  in 2016

thermal storage vaanster iii
for vaanster viii bv we financed several thermal storage systems such as the thermal storage system of a large
hotel in amsterdamwest the total loan amounted to 32 million euros partly provided by
asn groenprojectenfonds and partly by asn bank the co2 reduction is 143 tonnes




                                                                                                                             49

wind energy rentel
in a consortium of banks we financed rentel nv for 20 million euros for the construction of a 309megawatt wind
farm off the coast of belgium near zeebrugge

global climate partnership fund
we financed the global climate partnership fund sa sicavsif with 225 million euros this fund finances
investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency in developing countries both directly and through qualified
financial institutions when asn bank extended the loan the funds projects had already saved 44 million tonnes
of co2


care
asn bank has been providing private loans to the healthcare sector for many years our provision of services to
this sector fits in well with our sustainable human rights choices the following loans were new or expanded in
2016

rw og
since 2014 we have been financing the establishment of a healthcare institution for the elderly in a former office
building in almere haven the original loan of 31 million euros to rw og bv in almere was expanded by 310000
euros in 2016

zonptc
we financed zuidoost nederland protonen therapie centrum zonptc bv this cancer centre offers new less
burdensome radiation therapy proton therapy building the centre costs 405 million euros 125 million euros of
which was financed by asn bank for this loan we closely cooperated with the province of limburg liof and
rabobank


water management
in the netherlands water management is very important indeed water plays a key role in the development of our
living environment for example with regard to housing working nature conservation and leisure as far as the
environment is concerned since 2007 some water boards have been intensifying their activities in the areas of
climate change water quality nature conservation and biodiversity and exporting knowledge to third world
countries

as the water boards activities are highly harmonised we assess the sector as a whole in terms of human rights and
the environment


green bonds and social bonds
green bonds allow us to invest in fixedincome securities in the fields of renewable energy energy reduction and
biodiversity this fairly new category is a welcome addition to the banks balance sheet these bonds contribute
considerably to achieving our climate change objective of being fully carbon neutral by 2030

another bond category are the social bonds which are used to finance projects having a social impact such as
microfinance and social housing they match our sustainability policy perfectly

the following green bonds and social bonds were newly added to the portfolio in 2016

nordic investment bank
via the green bond of the nordic investment bank we invest in renewable energy energy efficiency projects
public transport waste reduction wastewater treatment and green buildings in the eu

german state of north rhinewestphalia
bundesland nrw uses its social bond to finance applied sciences in the field of sustainability such as sustainability
research by students and the construction of the bottrop energy campus for nine hundred students the
bundesland also makes a financial contribution to the european regional development fund which in turn
finances the tangible climate protection and energy revolution project

funds

are regarded as part of asn banks assets under management in other words actiam is authorised as referred to
in the aifm directive alternative investment fund managers directive a european directive laying down rules for
investment fund managers actiam executes the portfolio and risk management of the asn investment funds

asn beleggingsinstellingen beheer bv abb adopts the policies of the asn investment funds and monitors the
management of the funds these policies also include the sustainability guidelines and criteria


sustainability policy
the asn investment funds invest in companies countries and projects that are part of the asn investment
universe the management board of asn beleggingsinstellingen beheer bv abb decides on this universe
based on the sustainability criteria used by the asn selection committee abb executes this policy using three
instruments selection engagement and voting the application of these instruments is based on the sustainability
criteria of asn bank and abb we use each of these instruments according to a standard procedure


top score for sustainable investment
in 2010 asn bank signed the principles for responsible investment pri thus joining a global organisation of over
1200 institutional investors banks and asset managers who work together to further develop socially responsible
investment

a mandatory component of our pri membership is annual reporting on the sustainability of our investments funds
the report reveals how sustainability factors are part of our operations our policy our procedures and the
arrangements made with the fund managers executing our policy the pri organisation compares our results with
those of the other members

asn bank scores very well relative to other investors achieving the maximum score for almost all aspects that
were evaluated

                                                                       asn bank                average
strategy and management                                                a                      b

we achieved these scores because we determine our own sustainability policy this policy is comprehensive and
we have proper procedures in place to safeguard the policy another reason was that financial considerations
never take precedence over sustainability considerations we also provide our external fund managers with clear
sustainability frameworks our sustainability policy guides their management practices and sustainability decisions
thus safeguarding sustainability at all times

   scope 2 emissions indirect greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our own activities such as the generation
    of electricity we use
   scope 3 emissions the emissions of greenhouse gases in the supply chain such as the paper we use the
    loans we provide and the investments we make

in part thanks to carbon emission offsetting asn banks office is climate neutral for scope 1 and scope 2 our office
activities are climate neutral for part of scope 3 de volksbank offsets the remaining emissions

reduction of net emissions
our office activities lead to carbon emissions as we use fossil fuels for transporting employees and use gas through
district heating we are reducing the net emission levels of greenhouse gases in various ways

firstly all our electricity is generated in sustainable ways we have solar panels on the roof and our energy supplier
uses only renewable sources for its electricity production

secondly we aim to reduce our energy consumption both in the office and in the transport of employees in order
to reduce the average carbon emissions of the company cars used by our employees de volksbank annually
tightens their emission requirements in 2016 the requirement was 106 grams per kilometre for all new leases our
restrained use of airlines also translates into low carbon emissions per fte

increase in office carbon emissions
the offices absolute co2 emissions scopes 1 and 2 increased from 160 to 178 tonnes of co2 in 2016 this can be
attributed to the increase in heating energy consumption particularly due to the cold months at the end of 2016
we consumed more energy for heating the office

net result

savings and loans provided net commission income was up as assets under management of the asn investment
funds and asn asset management grew

the deposit guarantee scheme that was paid in 2016 allocated operating expenses are higher primarily because

report of the advisory council
we met four times in 2016 in the interim we met several times with the supervisory board of asn bank in
connection with the legal change which entailed the transfer of asn bank to the banking licence of sns bank nv
which was named de volksbank nv effective 1 january 2017 this was one of the main topics in 2016 which will
be discussed in more detail below

in 2016 the council was expanded by two new members carolien gehrels and marleen janssen groesbeek we
are now at full strength with a team of five members in total carolien gehrels previously worked at management
consultancy agency berenschot and as an alderman on the municipal executive of amsterdam she is currently
working for engineering firm arcadis marleen janssen groesbeek previously worked for het financieele dagblad
eumedion and dsm she is currently working for avans university of applied sciences

we were closely involved in all relevant issues that came up at asn bank in 2016 and we received satisfactory
information and explanations from the management board


change in legal structure
effective 1 january 2017 sns bank nvs name changed to de volksbank nv asn bank has been using the
banking licence of de volksbank nv along with blg wonen regiobank and sns since that date we spent a lot
of time on this change major points of concern were maintaining asn banks sustainable course its say in this and
maintaining its leading position we believe that this is now adequately safeguarded in both substantive and
procedural terms we will keep an advisory role in this respect a positive development was de volksbanks
decision to adopt asn banks sustainability policy complying with the request of de volksbanks board of
directors asn bank set up a sustainability centre of expertise to support the implementation of the sustainability
policy in all four of de volksbanks brands asn bank blg wonen regiobank and sns we recommended that the
centre of expertise be positioned such that recognition and support within de volksbank are guaranteed finally
we advised on communication to customers regarding the new legal structure


horizon
in 2016 saw the launch of project horizon entailing the repositioning of asn bank to a bank that provides
customer services of even higher quality being recognisable services of a sustainable nature that appeal to more
target groups we advised on the ease of recognition and ease of communication of the sustainable nature and on
the retention of our leading position in this area the bank is increasingly becoming a driving force in the financial
sector and we applaud this


longterm sustainability objectives
asn banks sustainability policy rests on three pillars climate change human rights and biodiversity for climate
change a longterm objective had already been formulated a climate neutral bank by 2030 for human rights an
objective was fleshed out in 2016 we recommended that choices be made in this very broad field in order to avoid
fragmentation of the banks efforts and achieve tangible results this resulted in a choice for the promotion of living
wages in the garment industry for which a programme was rolled out following our advice

in 2016 a goal for 2030 was also formulated as regards biodiversity no net negative impact as a result of
asn banks loans and investments we insisted on scientific validation of the measurement method used for this
purpose in addition we advised on how to give shape to asn banks role as a driver of biodiversity for other
financial institutions and finally we advised on communication to customers about this complex issue by
addressing two questions what is biodiversity and how does it relate to the bank


sustainability pillars in communication
asn bank used five sustainability issues child labour fair trade arms and security care and welfare renewable
energy and the three sustainability pillars climate change human rights and biodiversity we recommended
streamlining this multitude of issues thus creating a clearer focus in sustainability communication the three pillars
were assigned a more explicit central role




                                                                                                                                68

                                                                                                      asn bank report 2016

mortgages
in 2016 asn bank started developing its own mortgage product that promotes sustainable construction and
sustainable housing reflecting its wish that had been prevalent for some time the specific details were discussed
with us several times

we are confident about the collaboration within de volksbank the development of the sustainability policy and the
further elaboration of asn banks repositioning

responsibilities for the sustainability information
responsibilities of management and the supervisory board
management is responsible for the preparation of the sustainability information in accordance with the
sustainability reporting guidelines version g4 option core of gri and the supplemental applied reporting criteria
as disclosed on in chapter report of the annual report including the identification of stakeholders and the
definition of material matters the choices made by management regarding the scope of the sustainability
information and the reporting policy are summarized in the chapter report in the annual report

management is also responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
the sustainability information that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or errors

the supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the companys reporting process

our responsibilities
our responsibility is to plan and perform the review assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and
appropriate assurance evidence for our conclusion

we apply the nadere voorschriften accountantskantoren ter zake van assurance opdrachten ra and accordingly
maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding
compliance with ethical requirements professional standards and other applicable legal and regulatory
requirements

misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the sustainability
information the materiality affects the nature timing and extent of our review procedures and the evaluation of the
effect of identified misstatements on our conclusion

a review is aimed to obtain a limited level of assurance procedures performed to obtain a limited level of
assurance are aimed to determining the plausibility of information and are less extensive than a reasonable
assurance engagement the procedures performed consisted primarily of making inquiries of staff within the entity
and applying analytical procedures on the sustainability information the level of assurance obtained in review
engagements are therefore substantially less than the assurance obtained in an audit engagement

we have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the review in
accordance with the dutch standard 3810n ethical requirements and independence requirements

our main procedures consisted of

   performing an external environment analysis and obtaining insight into relevant social themes and issues and
    the characteristics of the organization
   evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting policy and its consistent application including the evaluation of
    the results of the stakeholders dialogue and the reasonableness of managements estimates
   evaluating the design and implementation of the reporting systems and processes related to the
    sustainability information
   inquiry of management and relevant staff at corporate and brand level responsible for the sustainability
    strategy policies and performance
   inquiry of relevant staff responsible for providing the information in the report carrying out internal control
    procedures on the data and consolidating the data in the sustainability information
   an analytical review of the data and trends
   evaluating whether the estimates made in the carbon neutral goal are reasonable including the assumptions
    on which the estimates were based which are included in the methodology of the carbon neutral balance
    sheet
   evaluating the suitability and plausibility of the external sources used in the calculations on which the carbon
    neutral goal data is based which are included in the methodology of the carbon neutral balance sheet
