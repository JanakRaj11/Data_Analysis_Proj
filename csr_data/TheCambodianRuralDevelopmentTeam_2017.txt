crdt continues to take the entrepreneurial approach in moving towards selfsustainability our two main
programs sustainable livelihood development and social enterprises have been part of a collective effort to
achieve crdts goals and a central part of crdts integrated implementation strategy

this year in addition to our continued focus on developing our social business institutions we have
emphasized the application of our single integrated implementation strategy first developed in 2015 what
makes crdt unique is the harmony of our various programs and subprograms each of which has a clear
function and determined approach to utilizing resources and staff expertise the complementary nature of our
various programs promotes synergy allowing for an improved means of addressing the problems at hand
this efficient way of executing project activities has led to an overall improvement for the beneficiaries at our
service

perhaps our most significant achievements of the year have been the formal acknowledgments of several of
crdts subsidiaries these notably include both the official registration of the shg finance plc with the ministry
of commerce and the recognition of le tonle as a vocational training center in tourism and hospitality with the
ministry of tourism

the registration of shg finance has given it the legitimacy and license to operate its credit delivery program
for beneficiaries paving the way for job creation and skill development through financial inclusion the
recognition of le tonle boosts the reputation of the enterprise thus enabling crdt to strengthen its
institutional development and enhance its capacity le tonle offers the opportunity to better the lives of
disadvantaged youth in northeastern cambodia addressing issues of economy and employment to alleviate
widespread poverty in the region next year le tonles restaurant and guesthouse will be expanded to double
its original size resulting in a twofold advantage there will be space to accommodate more guests as well as
additional open positions for apprenticeships

crdt has also enjoyed great success in strong partnership development partnerships with governmental
institutions other ngos and businesses with similar missions have been invaluable we have strengthened our
existing relationships while working on building new partnerships including with plan international cambodia
this year we reached a partnership agreement with plan committed to working on projects including
improved motherchild nutrition and income generation climate change resilience ccawash and crship
plans cooperation and shared commitment will ensure the continued success of the aforementioned
projects and we are eager for the opportunity to collaborate
                                                                                                                     1

we are also grateful to continue working closely with various governmental agencies including the provincial
departments of agriculture rural development tourism health education and womens affairs particularly
in kratie and stung treng

our work is not limited to that of crdt and its partners but expands to consultancy work with governments
ngos and private sector on various projects including agricultural value chains labored skill markets and
industry assessment studies and community development plans for elc projects

we here at crdt are constantly learning we learn from our actions reflecting on successes and failures alike
and we are committed to improvement we pride ourselves on an innovative exploratory approach to finding
solutions for our beneficiaries when implementing our annual strategies we engage in periodic reviews
adapting our plans to the changing situations

in 2016 we focused on water supplies and sustainable farming in our efforts to contain and prevent the harmful
impacts of climate change we centered our attention on building entrepreneurial strategies of water
management and cyclical farming this work in conjunction with the enhancement of our skill development
programs and the improvement of our social enterprise management ensures selfsufficiency and
sustainability through income diversity

our priorities moving forward include the expansion and enhancement of water supply systems implementing
sustainable farming strategies developing farming community groups into agricultural cooperatives and
improving villagers business skills and environmental education

communities we service

   sustainable bamboo enterprise 
     making changes in womens selfesteem

the koh ent chey community forestry lies along the mekong river in the sambo district kratie
province the main income sources for a total of 126 families in this community are from fishing
and nontimber forest products ntfps to be able to reach this community a boat is required
 and this method is time consuming and costly for villagers including when they wish to travel
   to the market however after the community was assessed it was felt that they had good
                         potential for developing bamboo enterprises

      to contribute to their income generation cambodian rural development team crdt
   partnering with the usaid sfb project through its bamboo livelihood development initiative
     facilitating the formation of a bamboo processing enterprise group this provided a set of
 trainings such as sustainable bamboo harvesting bamboo incense stick processing and market
linkage skills the result of this initiative is that there is now a profitable business ran by the local
             community which supplies highquality products to the cambodian market

before most women were free and spent time for relax and chitchat after the enterprise group
     is established there were changes in the womens selfesteem confidence and decision
 making now they can join in the enterprise group to produce incense sticks said ms van sen
     bamboo processing enterprise group leader the project not only provided the capacity
 strengthening but also coordinated the process of securing the bopha angkor company as an
  incense stick buyer additionally the project team supported the group to successfully set up
    an incense stick processing machine which helps them process a quantity of good quality
    incense sticks to supply the orders  the bamboo enterprise activity provides better jobs
                       especially for women in my group added ms van sen

 mr bin dim the livelihood project manager of crdt confirmed that whenever womens skills
are improved they gain better recognition rights and respect from the men in their own families
  and in the community as a whole we would like to see more women empowered and gain
   better life skills so they can build their confidence and earn more income for themselves
the bamboo processing enterprise group is very happy with the project support and is grateful
   for the funding of the american people for building their skills and helping make their lives
                                                 better
                                                                                                      11


                                case study
              water brings relief to
               indigenous bunong family
mrs poeun pheap lives in the pu char village of the sre preah commune with her husband
yen sok and their two yearold daughter the majority of villagers in pu char are poor and
vulnerable partly due to their lack of access to water and sanitation resources for several
 years pheap and her husband have been collecting water for daily usage from a stream
   over 2000 meters from their home the time and energy required for such a journey
 discouraged the family from planting vegetables during the dry season and made good
                     hygiene and sanitation practices nearly impossible

   backed by the support of the australian governments direct aid program dap crdt
    implemented a project promoting water systems for health and sanitation among the
indigenous people of pu char two water supply systems with storage capacities of 10 m3
were installed with pipes connecting the houses in the village this water storage capacity
is enough to supply 70 families including the mrs poeun pheap family with running water

 i use water from crdts water supply system i could never have imagined having water
running by pipe to my house because i live in a remote area of northeast cambodia where
the communities depend on water from natural streams mrs poeun pheap explained she
    uses an average of 5 m3 to 6 m3 monthly the price of water per 1 m3 is an affordable
        1000r and i now earn more money when i sell my vegetables in the market

     this change has allowed her the ability to take care of her family without getting
preoccupied about the lack of water for daily use and has given her the time to practice her
 method coaching from the crdt project staff on primary health the success of the water
  project system in pu char has inspired crdt to continue expanding its water project to
               other communities in target areas in more sustainable ways

le tonle brings joy and possibility
                   to stung treng family
stung treng native lon sivila is 23 years old and a student at le tonlé coming from
a poor family she was uncertain of her future upon finishing secondary school vila
    went to phnom penh in search of employment so that she could save up for
 university after a few months she fell ill and had to return home her parents were
   then forced to borrow money from both neighbors and the bank to pay for her
                                  medical treatment

  when vila recovered she was sent to work in malaysia for two years under harsh
 working conditions exacerbated by the cruelty of her superior and colleagues she
 was unhappy deciding to return home and gave the money to her parents so that
 they could repay their debts unfortunately living at home meant that finding work
                                    was difficult
 that all changed when le tonlé announced that they were accepting applications
from disadvantaged youths in northeast cambodia when vila received notice of her
                         acceptance she cried tears of joy

it has been the best change for me and my family after i finished my studies i hope
    to find a good job vila said expressing overwhelming gratitude for the work of
 crdt le tonle and all those who support their endeavors without their work vila
 would not be where she is today and they have made a true change possible in the
                              lives of vila and so many others

2017 developments
crdt faced several challenges in 2016 all of which have
influenced the strategic development plan for 2017

these challenges were both internal and external shortages of
staff staff capacity and delayed funding made executing the work
at hand more difficult the complications of licensing and financial
management slowed the pacing and lengthened the timeline of
certain projects water shortages and illegal income opportunities
discouraged trained farmers from adopting the new cultivation
and market techniques and the hardships associated with tasks
from communication to construction all took their toll on crdts
efforts
