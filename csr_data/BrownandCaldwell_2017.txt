            make a difference across the united states suddenly there
            was a push for more responsible methods for dealing with
            stormwater runoff more efficient ways to treat wastewater
            and innovative approaches to preventing pollution in
            estuaries lakes and rivers

     recycling back in the 1960s seem eerily prescient

the city of lake oswego needed an affordable longterm solution to ensure reliable sewer
service to its 37000 residents its original 1960s lake interceptor was undersized and corroding
