iwatani starts new supply business
responding to increasing demand for natural gas




overview of natural gas supply company koga energy




       natural gas supplier koga energy co ltd
       started full natural gas supply in may 2007
           natural gas has a much smaller environmental impact
       than oil reserves are huge and it is clean iwatani has so far
       supplied natural gas to large industrial customers and in
       order to meet a wider range of demands established a
       natural gas supply company koga energy co ltd koga
       city shiga prefecture jointly with kansai electric power         three lng tanks 100 kiloliters were installed in the satellite base and additional tanks will
       co inc and koga kyodo gas co ltd the company start           be built for more stable supply

       ed full natural gas supply in may 2007
           koga energy built necessary facilities including a satellite
       base and gas pipelines within its natural gas delivery area it
       will expand the use of natural gas in households shops and
       small factories by supplying natural gas to koga kyodo gas
       a general gas operator while directly delivering natural gas
       to large industrial consumers for stable and smooth supply
           this natural gas supply business model by koga energy
       is the first such attempt in the nation and has attracted atten
       tions as a new business model for converting regional energy
       sources to natural gas                                             lorries are a fundamental means of delivering lng iwatani already owns several dozen

natural gas koga energy suggested a new way of supplying                                             lowtemperature gases which is the key to the supply of
natural gas called satellite supply this has enabled us to be                                     natural gas in addition we already operate several dozen lor

 iwatanis measures to the environment         logistics
the transportation sector accounts for over 20 of total co2 emission in japan making it essential to reduce
their emissions iwatani also strives to reduce environmental burdens from logistics throughout the group



   target reduction setting for co2 emitted in the context of logistics

  iwatani has strived for improving the efficiency in freight transporta

ingabolishing existing logistics centers using transportation means with
less environmental burden and ecodriving the volume of freight trans
portation in fy 2006 as a specified consigner provided in the law con
