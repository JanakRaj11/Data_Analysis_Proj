dear stakeholders
2016 was a year of great progress in sustainability initiatives at ddr our employees
were hard at work exploring new avenues for efficiencies sustainable strategies and
community outreach opportunities

through the efforts of our sustainability team we began refining our processes to
grow our led lighting conversions installed additional lighting controls on a mass
scale installed cool roofing products on our buildings installed electric car charging
stations across the portfolio and continued to facilitate over 226 mw of solar
power on 15 properties

the results of these initiatives do not come easily and require tireless efforts
from many departments within the company the dedication collaboration and
partnerships required in the execution of these programs make every one of these
successes a true win for our programs and our employees

although we are a real estate company and our main focus is the physical buildings
that we own none of our successes would be possible without the support from the
communities we serve our employees are always trying to find ways to give back to
those communities and support those in need the amount of charitable giving that
took place during 2016 was nothing short of amazing through the efforts of our
employees we donated over 300000 in charitable contributions and took part in
150 charitable community events

additionally dozens of ddr employees and executives gave back to their local
communities on their own time by serving on the boards of nonprofit organizations
such as boys  girls clubs of cleveland the childrens museum of cleveland ymca
of greater cleveland and greater cleveland habitat for humanity

as we look forward to the coming year i am excited to lead the company through
the opportunities and challenges of the retail real estate industry i am also excited
about seeing the creativity and collaboration of our teams as we find new ways to
build a sustainable and responsible future
