 methodology document available on wwwemiratescomaboutenvironment
2 the metrics marked  are covered by pwcs assurance procedures see pwc assurance report on pages 5455

3 the methodology for calculating passenger fuel and co2 efficiency was amended for the 201415 environmental report to make it more

  accurate the passenger efficiency figures for 201314 have therefore been recalculated with the new methodology to enable comparison
  under the previouslyused methodology passenger fuel efficiency was 405 litres per 100 passenger kilometres and passenger co2
  efficiency was 1003 grams co2 per passenger kilometre for 201314
4 unlike the other fuel efficiency metrics we report the higher the ofef value the better the efficiency a positive percentage change

  therefore reflects improvement over time

occupying facilities around the world and operating a large fleet of ground
vehicles all of these operations inevitably produce a range of environmental
impacts varying in scope and scale


in this report we focus on major environmental aspects and have assessed each aspect         beyond the operational environmental aspects described above we recognise the clear

despite the new generations of aircraft being significantly quieter than their
predecessors noise also remains an issue around many airports we report here on the
performance of our fleet relative to the applicable international aircraft noise standards


on the ground we concentrate on our vehicle and equipment fuel use and emissions
electricity and water consumption and waste generation  as well as efforts to reduce
impacts in these areas

jet fuel and the resulting emissions are our most significant environmental
concern and the lower fuel prices have not altered our focus on fuel efficiency

fuel efficiency

as emirates primarily operates medium and longhaul flights fuel efficiency measures
can make a significant impact on our bottom line as well as helping to reduce emissions
this is why we cooperate with aviation authorities and air traffic control organisations
across the world to test and validate new fuelsaving flight procedures during the
year our flight operations specialists worked with agencies in countries as far afield
as the usa austria france malta the seychelles ethiopia kenya and pakistan  as
well as dubais neighbouring emirate of sharjah  to introduce or validate new
performancebased navigation pbn procedures which will help to both reduce fuel
consumption and enhance operational safety

we recorded a large fall in electricity and water consumption in dubai during the year       some parts of our reported electricity and water use are outside our direct control for
which can be attributed to several factors to begin with the new facilities occupied by     example a large proportion of our electricity consumption comes from the operation of
group business units during the year have been designed to optimise energy and                the terminals and other buildings occupied by the group at dubai international airport and
water efficiency                                                                             dwc the variation in meter reading dates at the airport facilities has an impact on final

lights are expected to save over 970 mwh of electricity a year meanwhile judicious use      have their own water meters skycargos move to dwc left their previouslyoccupied facility

double shutter doors on the loading docks help to keep in temperaturecontrolled air         operations again resulting in a reported fall in consumption


in the emirates group headquarters the emirates group facilities department                  we will be working to gain a more detailed understanding of group electricity and water
overhauled the air chillers which together with the use of automated mode settings to        consumption levels at our various facilities over the coming year
switch off unnecessary air conditioning in unoccupied areas after office hours resulted
in greatly improved energy efficiency

                                    called sarcoptic mange the condition results in unsightly and painful skin infections and
                                    ultimately can kill the affected animal this year we supported a new project that will enable
                                    anyone with a smartphone to participate in wombat conservation research and monitoring


                                    emirates airline and emirates oneonly wolgan valley jointly funded the development
                                    of the womsat app and website which were created by the university of western sydney


                                    the app allows anyone to use the inbuilt global positioning system gps of a
                                    smartphone to report wombat sightings and record the animals health the information
                                    is then uploaded to an online map which will help researchers identify and treat affected
                                    wombat populations


                                    on 1st february 2015 emirates began a new partnership with oneonly resorts a
                                    subsidiary of kerzner international holdings limited to manage the resort and expand the
                                    high quality wolgan valley experience emirates will continue to retain full ownership and
                                    the conservation and community principles that the resort began with will stay unchanged
