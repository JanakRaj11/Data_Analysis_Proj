         why nuclear power generation
         is necessary
          japan is not rich in energy resources
          the energy selfsufficiency rate of japan is only 6 and                   annual consumption of electricity
          the nation depends greatly on imports for energy                             by major countries 2013
          resources japan thus faces a range of risks regarding the                  ranking            country       consumption billions kwh

    q what measures are implemented to treat spent nuclear fuel and highlevel radioactive waste
           it is important to establish a cycle to treat spent nuclear fuel specifically to reprocess the uranium used as fuel at nuclear power plants
    a tohighlevel
           recover plutonium and uranium and make effective use of the recovered substances it is also necessary to tackle the issue of
                   radioactive waste generated from the reprocessing process of the spent fuel
        the japanese government formulated an action plan on the disposal of spent nuclear fuel in october 2015 and announced its commitment
   to accelerating the measures to expand the capacity to store spent fuel chubu electric power is planning to build a dry cask storage facility
   within the premises of the hamaoka nuclear power station and the nuclear regulation authority is now examining its safety the government
   is also examining sites that are scientifically suitable for the geological disposal of highlevel radioactive waste and aims to announce the
   candidates for the final repository of the waste by the end of 2016 chubu electric power will work to gain more public understanding about
   final disposal while continuing to support the activities of the nuclear waste management organization of japan numo

measures to increase the competitiveness of lngfired combined cycle
power generation facilities
chubu electric power is working to make its lngfired combined cycle
power generation facilities even more competitive
    on the facilities front gas turbines of the unit no 3 of the kawagoe
thermal power station are now being replaced with new models to




                                                                                                                                                     business activities under a new system
further improve thermal efficiency and minimize output loss in summer
these new types of turbines will also be introduced to the unit no 7 of
the shinnagoya thermal power station
    to operate our power stations more competitively we are working to
ensure power demand will be met even in the event of a sudden change
which may occur due to greater use of solar power generation with
varying power generation output depending on weather conditions
example measures include the efforts to shorten the time from suspending
lngfired combined cycle power generation facilities to resuming them

antitsunami measures at owasemita thermal power station
antitsunami measures are in place at the owasemita thermal power
station in preparation for a possible tsunami occurrence caused by an
anticipated nankai trough megaquake
     example measures for facilities include the installation of evacuation
places and stairs and emergency shutoff valves equipped with oil pipes
to prevent fuel from spilling from damaged parts likewise an
emergency undocking device and a quick release hook to evacuate a
tanker unloading fuel to offshore are also available
     as operational measures we have consolidated and removed
certain fuel tanks and oil types to prevent fuel tank spillages in the
event of a tsunami we also maintain a high level of fuel in tanks and
keep dormant tanks filled with water
     for prompt evacuation of workers on the deck from which fuel is being
unloaded from a tanker a lifeboat compliant with governmental tsunami
lifeboat guidelines has been installed at the deck since march 2016

launch of operation of all units of the tokuyama hydroelectric power station
after its construction work for six and a half years all the units of the
tokuyama hydroelectric power station started operation in march 2016
when the unit no1 1390 mw was put in operation following the
launch of the operation of the unit no 2 243 mw in may 2014
    this power station is the largest among our general hydroelectric
power stations excluding those using pumpedstorage hydroelectricity
    when the two units are in operation simultaneously the total output
of the power station will be 1619 mw which can supply electricity to
about 83000 households the annual reduction amount of co 2
emissions will be up to 150000 tco2

construction for preventing the galloping of the shinanotoshin
lines 275 kv
a power outage occurred on march 2 2015 due to the suspended
operation of shinanotoshin lines two circuits 275 kv affecting up to
380000 households in the wide areas in the northern eastern and
central part of nagano prefecture
    our investigation identified that the blackout was caused because the
transmission lines at the two circuits were simultaneously contacted
many times as a result of the socalled galloping  power lines we
accordingly performed the construction work to prevent the
reoccurrence and completed it on november 18 2015
    specifically we analyzed the facilities installation status and climate
conditions of all the shinanotoshin lines and identified 18 sections that
required improvement measures accordingly we installed 714 loose spacers
and 60 interphase spacers in those sections the former device is for
preventing the galloping phenomena and the latter is for preventing multiple

 galloping refers to a phenomenon where power lines with moist snow attached make violent vertical
  movements when they are blown continuously by the wind


support for recovery from massive blackout after serious earthquakes
in kumamoto
on april 16 2016 devastating earthquakes struck kumamoto prefecture
the quakes triggered a massive mudslide which took down transmission
lines that serve aso city takamori town and minami aso village
resulting in a wide power outage there in response to the request from
the local utility kyushu electric power we dispatched our power
generation vehicles and 511 employees to support the recovery efforts
    under very difficult conditions such as many aftershocks and heavy
rain our employees worked hard and contributed to the successful

             following the suspension of operations of the hamaoka nuclear power station in 2011 the co2 emission
             intensity of chubu electric power dramatically increased to reduce co2 emissions it is essential not only to
             introduce highefficiency thermal power generation and make greater use of renewable energy but also to
             use nuclear power with the highest priority placed on ensuring the safety and while earning the trust
             of local residents
                  chubu electric power will pursue an optimal energy mix promote energy conservation and
             thoroughly implement environmental management to build a lowcarbon society on a global scale
