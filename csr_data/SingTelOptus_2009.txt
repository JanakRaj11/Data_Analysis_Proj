                        connecting people it illustrates what we have and will continue to make
                        possible as the leading competitor in telecommunications to drive a fair
                        and competitive playing field for the benefit of all australians

indicator of corporate responsibility becoming just the way that
we do business

connecting people is what we do best and it plays a key role
in our approach to corporate responsibility over the past year
we have invested over a83 million in community programs
and activities with a focus on supporting those that build social
inclusion and help to reconnect disadvantaged youth

our technology was also employed in the fight against climate
change in antarctica our d1 satellite coverage of mcmurdo
enabled the collection and distribution of data to the scientific
community working in the region this data will soon include
detailed information that will lead to substantial improvements
in weather forecasts and monitoring allowing for a deeper
understanding of the climate changes occurring

with extreme weather events likely to increase as the result
of climate change we have been working to strengthen our
network infrastructure and our disaster response as we saw in
the bushfires that devastated many victorian communities in
february 2009 our network infrastructure is at risk thanks to
the remarkable commitment of our people and our innovative
technological capability we were able to reconnect over 3000
people within the first week after the bushfires we also
supported our customers and communities impacted by the
fires in the months that followed by zerobilling our customers
for up to three months and donating over 1000 prepaid mobiles
each with a1000 of call credits i also want to recognise the
commitment and generosity of our people who donated a140000
to the salvation army bushfire appeal this figure was matched
by optus with over a390000 in total being donated to help
those who had lost so much in this devastating event

i would like to take this opportunity to invite you to learn more
about our corporate responsibility efforts over the past year
i also thank all our people for a fantastic year  one in which
we have achieved some outstanding things together

  when it comes to communication
  anything is possible


   whale song
   in march 2009 we launched a major brand campaign
   featuring the whale song this bold and positive
   brand campaign was designed to illustrate the power
   of communication and the importance of optus role in
   connecting people

   the inspiration for the campaign was based on research
   conducted by the university of queensland the university
   of queensland had begun to decode whale communication
   using technology that was once used to detect submarines
   to show the power of language to connect with others

   the campaign shows the emotional heart of the optus
   brand and uses nature in an inspirational way our
   business is about connecting people enabling dialogue
   through the internet mobile phone teleconferencing text
   messages satellite and more

   the university of queenslands pioneering research
   illustrates what can be achieved with positive thinking
   and determination together with innovation optus is a
   proud supporter of the laboratory and is pleased to have
   contributed to the funding of this important research

the focus of our work this year was to reduce both type and
volume of packaging in a number of our mobile and broadband
products particularly for dvds and sim cards

this included

 actively working with our fixed broadband vendors to reduce
  package sizes and nonessential plastics one project
  with a supplier of networking and storage equipment to
  small business is hoped to reduce the use of nonessential
  plastics in packaging by up to 15 tonnes per year and
 the development of a sim pack that is 75 per cent smaller
  and as a result enabling us to ship more per delivery and
  reduce packaging requirements the ability to ship more
  per delivery also reduces the greenhouse gas emissions
  associated with travel
