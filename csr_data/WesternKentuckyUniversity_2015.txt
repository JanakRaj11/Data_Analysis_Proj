resulted in an increase in scope 3 emissions partly oﬀsetting reductions made in scope 1 and

in the garden                garden continued to
                              expand in 2015 under the
                              careful nurturing of the
project grow fellows as a result we were able to
provide fresh vegetables for the food pantry for much
of the growing season not only did we grow food we
grew relationships and knowledge

the garden has become a space for people to come
together for a common interest  getting in touch with
nature through gardening every friday volunteers from
diverse backgrounds and disciplines come to help
plant harvest water and care for the garden in other
ways they learn from each other and reap benefits
perhaps unexpected new friendships an added bonus
the fellows often prepare food fresh from the garden or
send volunteers home with fresh veggies

two of the seven fellows are conducting research
projects in the oos landscape alex hezik is turning the
front yard into an edible landscape as her honors
capstone project megan lafoon is conducting research on hugel gardening specifically on yield
comparison with other gardening


the project grow fellow
community is one of the only
places on campus where i feel
that i belong and have been
present and involved in building a
meaningful community
