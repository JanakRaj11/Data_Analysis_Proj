strategic role of corporate responsibility




letter from jay hooley chairman and ceo
joseph l hooley is chairman and
chief executive officer of state street corporation

at state street corporate responsibility cr is firmly ingrained in our culture and business strategy we know that
making a positive impact on the world is not only the right thing to do its smart business being a responsible
corporate citizen makes sense for all of our stakeholders  our employees our clients our shareholders and
society at large

environmental sustainability
protecting the environment while supporting sustainable development is a major priority for us in 2015 we
continued to make substantial progress toward our goal to reduce our greenhouse gas ghg emissions and water
use by 20 percent per person by 2020 compared to a 2012 baseline at the end of the year we had achieved a 17
percent reduction in both categories while also closing in on our goal of drastically reducing waste sent to
landfills

we continue to manage the environmental impact of our operations with 56 percent of our global square footage
of office space now certified to iso 14001 standards our investment in a wind power project near our new office in
gdansk poland helped offset 26000 metric tons of carbon impact an amount equivalent to our 2014 business
travel emissions we also acquired 202 million kilowatthours of renewable energy certificates recs
representing 110 percent of the electricity we purchased in the us in 2015

we are proud to be a leader in helping investors incorporate environmental social and governance esg factors
into their investment decisions we first started managing esg portfolios in 1986 and as of the end of 2015 had
more than 1684 billion in esg assets under management in december 2015 we launched an exchange traded
fund designed to help investors eliminate fossil fuel reserves from their portfolios while maintaining exposure to
the core of the sp 500 index

investing in our communities
the strength of our business is directly linked to the wellbeing of the communities in which we operate our state
street foundation provided 227 million to nonprofit organizations around the world in 2015 including matching
employee contributions of 415 million to 2222 charitable organizations we encourage our employees to be
active in our communities and more than a fifth of them participated in companysponsored volunteer activities
during the year devoting 116000 hours of their time to charitable causes




                                                                                     corporate responsibility        4

in june we launched the boston workforce investment network or boston wins a fouryear pilot program to
boost education and job readiness for urban youth in our headquarters city in an innovative approach to corporate
philanthropy our foundation pledged to donate 20 million to five nonprofit organizations over four years and hire
1000 young people who work with them to advance their education and job readiness all five of these partner
organizations have committed to working closely with each other and with state street to pursue our shared
objectives of providing education training and meaningful career opportunities for boston youth  and to regularly
measure assess and report our joint progress


diversity and inclusion

building a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment are essential elements of our culture for us diversity
represents the variety of backgrounds perspectives and experiences within our organization while inclusion is
about soliciting and respecting different perspectives to promote a culture of engagement innovation and
constructive debate and challenge

our workforce should mirror the clients and communities we serve and we want our employees to be able to see
themselves reflected in their leaders to this end we set a series of goals to increase the diversity of our middle
management and leadership ranks by the end of 2017 and we will measure progress on diversity and inclusion as
part of our annual performance reviews for all managers


risk management

our stakeholders expect us to serve them fairly and act appropriately in all we do and doing so is an essential
element of our values in 2015 we launched a companywide initiative to elevate risk excellence as a top priority
we strengthened our risk assessment and monitoring capabilities by investing in skilled people technology and
processes we also rolled out a newly revised standard of conduct and ethical decisionmaking framework to all
employees and stressed the importance of holding ourselves to the highest possible standards and challenging
ourselves and each other to make sound decisions


committed to cr

as a signatory to the united nations global compact were committed to advancing its 10 universal principles for
responsible business as well as the sustainable development goals sdgs the un issued in september 2015
these sdgs are aimed at addressing important esg challenges and several of them are closely aligned with our
goals were pleased with the progress weve made advancing our cr agenda but we recognize theres more to
do we will continue our work to be a responsible corporate citizen and make a more positive impact on the world




                                                                                     corporate responsibility        5

letter from pat centanni chairman of the executive corporate responsibility committee

pat centanni is an executive vice president and manager of state street global realty procurement  continuity
services he will retire in june 2016 after more than 25 years at state street

every year im excited to see how we can continue to weave corporate responsibility cr further into our strategy
from the 2020 environmental goals we set in 2012 to the investments we made this year in our boston wins job
readiness program were preserving our promise of building a sustainable future


where we are

as a solutionsfocused company we use the insights we gain from talking to our clients to develop solutions for
their business this includes helping them incorporate cr into their own business

but our commitment to cr is more than just the solutions we offer to clients its also how we engage our
employees to help them grow in their careers and stay connected to our goals our focus on cr helps employees
know they work at a company whose values align to theirs suppliers are another way we can make a difference
over the past few years weve taken a close look at our supply chain and have started implementing procurement
policies on social and environmental responsibility wherever we can we look to work with partners that
demonstrate socially responsible sourcing


where were going

as we look forward we want to zero in on the most relevant cr topics and make sure top management is
informed and can lead the charge we need to clearly articulate what matters to our business and all
stakeholders

in 2016 well continue to promote esg product and service opportunities through state street global advisors
ssga initiatives and by working with our global strategy team to develop a corporatewide approach when it
comes to the environment well look for additional opportunities to lower our carbon footprint water usage and
waste amount so that we can reach our 2020 goals

an important part of our way ahead is also setting new goals as signatories to the un global compact we want
to make sure our cr and community initiatives align with the uns sustainable development goals well identify
those most material to state street to establish metrics and report on our progress and while our human rights
statement has served us well since we first issued it in 2008 well be updating it this year for greater clarity
finally were also considering ways we can include cr in our employees annual goals i think this will truly help
strengthen the belief that everyone can contribute to our goals of building a sustainable future




                                                                                     corporate responsibility         6

material corporate responsibility topics
creating focused value

our corporate responsibility cr initiatives and this report focus on the most relevant topics for our company and
stakeholders we update our list of material cr topics every two years based on guidelines from the global
reporting initiative gri in 2015 our assessment which is supported by the cr consultancy sustainserv began
with a list of 32 cr topics these were compiled from gri the iso 26000 guidance on social responsibility the
sustainability accounting standards board sasb and cr reports of other financial services companies

a number of test questions helped us narrow this down to 15 topics that create the greatest value for our business
and stakeholders these questions addressed whether a topic presents significant risks or opportunities to our
company whether it is related to our values or whether it has been raised by external partners or employees as
impacting their interests


inviting feedback

to determine the topics most important to our company we engaged colleagues across business units and from
our north america europe middle east and africa emea and asiapacific apac operations they completed an
online survey based on our test questions and refined the results at an inperson workshop in boston and online
workshops in emea and apac to assess the topics in a holistic manner the survey also looked at relevant
impacts that could occur in our value chain

to identify the topics most relevant to our stakeholders we invited a select group of clients investors suppliers
nongovernmental organizations ngos and academics to complete an online survey supplemented with a few
followup interviews in addition we asked a small group of employees which topics they believed were most
important and included their feedback in our final assessments


ongoing observation

the chart below shows how relevant our 15 focus topics are for our business and stakeholders it also lists the
topics that fell outside of the materiality scope while were not specifically discussing these topics in this report
well continue to manage them appropriately and reassess their relevance for future reports

we decided that some topics were not material on their own but still contribute to our performance on other
topics that are material examples include the impact of energy efficiency as well as business travel and
commuting on our greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of human rights policies and training on our
responsible sourcing

our approach and performance on these material topics are discussed in this report and in our online gri report

europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific apac perspectives

to ensure our cr reporting includes perspectives from all our global regions we asked regional representatives
to help select our most relevant cr topics see pages 89 to avoid a north american bias we also asked senior
management from our regional teams for feedback on how we discuss the relevant topics in the report while the
different chapters throughout this report include regional considerations and examples we summarize
overarching comments from colleagues in emea and apac here


increasing demand for esg capabilities

esg demand from clients in emea was significant in 2015 expressed for example in requests for proposals rfps
to conduct business this aligns with findings from our global survey of 400 pension funds which revealed that 83
percent anticipate a moderate or high level of interest in esg investing over the next three years eighty percent of
those in emea reported they were more likely to consider hiring a manager that has esg capabilities compared
with one that doesnt nordic pension funds are particularly active on esg issues with norways government
pension fund global being one of the leaders in the field


strong expectations for governance

since the financial crisis many apac regulators have focused on corporate governance one expectation is for the
head of a local legal entity to be fully accountable for local business dealings and decision making this can have
significant impact for multinational banks such as state street that are vertically organized and have globally led
systems infrastructure and functional support for example we offshore a number of activities to centers of
excellence to increase efficiency and effectiveness we need to demonstrate to regulators that our local offices
have sufficient oversight and decision rights in these arrangements

also there is increased expectation from the european central bank as well as from the uks financial conduct
authority fca and prudential regulatory authority pra among others they want state street management in
emea to have local decisionmaking authority oversee local implementation of global strategy and have clear
accountability in the uk the senior managers regime smr expected to begin in early 2016 will result in far
higher levels of personal accountability for senior executives of the london branches all other ukregulated firms
are expected to be subject to similar requirements by 2018


data protection required by regulators and clients

data governance and data confidentiality are important issues in emea for example swiss banking laws limit our
ability to share client data across our corporation or systems also regulators across apac are increasingly
focused on customer data protection privacy and cybersecurity issues although rules and regulations vary from
market to market for example in applying our global marketing automation and client relationship tools we
found that in one jurisdiction data has to be stored locally while in another data encryption is required for data
transfer customizing our solutions allows us to ensure local compliance




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      10

increasing requirements on esg reporting

in the european union a directive is unfolding to make reporting on nonfinancial matters including human rights
employeerelated issues diversity and the environment mandatory for thousands of companies by 2018 there are
also local disclosure requirements on specific esg topics for example uk antislavery law requires employment
related disclosures and the uk government is currently proposing mandatory gender pay disclosure for firms with
more than 250 employees

recently there have been a number of new requirements and consultation processes on esg reporting in apac
for example the hong kong stock exchange conducted a consultation in 2015 which resulted in a requirement
that each issuer must disclose esg information annually the singapore stock exchange also held a consultation
on esg reporting in 2015 and published esg disclosure rules for consultation in early 2016 as a result australia
south korea malaysia taiwan and india have established or are developing requirements for disclosures
regarding esg issues




                                                                                   corporate responsibility     11

corporate strategy and corporate responsibility
aligning corporate strategy and responsibility

inspired by the guiding principles of the integrated reporting framework published by the international integrated
reporting council iirc our 2014 cr report took the first step to show how cr issues are part of our business
strategy by exploring how material cr topics align with different parts of our strategy we understood better how
cr supports our strategic goals


focusing on the future

the way ahead is our strategy and road map for the future designed to move our business forward its focused
on four strategic priorities that rest on a foundation of trust culture innovation and risk excellence

       build on our strong core by aligning solutions with client needs and continuing to innovate so that were in a
        stronger position to capture value and improve efficiency

       achieve a digital enterprise by automating processes and digitizing much of how we do business to benefit
        our employees clients and shareholders

       maintain our capital strength by prioritizing our strong capital position so that we can grow and deliver
        returns to our shareholders

       pursue new opportunities by focusing on prospects for growth that are informed by future trends




                                                              longterm
                                                           financial growth


                build                          achieve                        maintain                         pursue
                on our                         a digital                      our capital                      new
                strong core                    enterprise                     strength                         opportunities
                without a strong foundation   we need to build on what       our strong capital position      because were operating
                we have nothing to build on   we achieved with our it        is a differentiator for us       from a position of strength
                we need to align solutions     and operations program to      from a regulatory and            not only can we see changes
                with client needs continue    drive greater transformation   client standpoint it provides   in the market but we can
                to innovate capture value     that benefits our employees   us with flexibility to grow      also act on them we will
                and improve efficiency        our clients and our           and to deliver returns to        place a few significant
                                               shareholders                  our shareholders                longterm growth bets
                                                                                                               informed by future trends




                             talent culture innovation and risk excellence




                                                                                                                 corporate responsibility     12

determining areas of impact

as part of our cr materiality assessment see pages 89 and in cr working group meetings with global teams we
discussed how cr topics impact our strategy to fully capture the complex connections between responsibility and
business this year we recorded both the primary impacts of cr topics to our strategy as well as secondary but
still meaningful impacts

the results are clear all parts of our corporate strategy can be supported by our attention to relevant cr topics
two of our priorities  build on our strong core and pursue new opportunities  as well as the foundation of
talent culture innovation and risk excellence are particularly impacted by this focus

we have initiatives and incentives in place for many strategically important cr issues such as ethics risk
excellence and diversity and inclusion in addition well continue to explore how our cr programs support how we
execute our strategy clearly there are ample opportunities for valuable connections that will drive longterm
financial growth and help us continue to build trusted relationships with all stakeholders

compliance and business ethics
building trust

the financial crisis dramatically changed how clients shareholders employees and communities view corporate
organizations as a financial services provider its more important than ever that our stakeholders see us as a
trusted partner to earn and keep this trust we must hold ourselves to the highest possible standards all of our
business units are responsible for complying with rules and regulations and adhering to our ethical requirements
as a first line of defense our compliance teams and audit function are the second and third lines

as part of an agreement reached in 2015 with us and massachusetts banking regulators we were required to
implement enhancements to our antimoney laundering and bank secrecy act compliance programs

because our reputation rests on the behavior of every employee we revised our global standard of conduct to
focus even more on conduct and culture in 2015 we also introduced a new ethical decision making framework
and reinforced our managers roles as the first line of defense


adding staff and training

in 2015 we expanded our ethics office from 11 to 33 members by establishing new regional ethics leaders in
emea and apac and adding to the overall strength of our team weve enhanced our advice counsel and
monitoring activities companywide

the ethics team created and provided inperson ethical decision making training to 364 executive vice presidents
and senior vice presidents globally in 2015 these evps and svps then delivered inperson leaderled training in
ethical decision making to more than 7000 of our senior executives and more than 1400 assistant vice
presidents and above completed equivalent integrity at work trainings in emea


strengthening personal accountability

globally all staff received online training in antibribery conflict of interest and other standard of conduct
matters we increased the attention to ontime completion of training and in 2015 achieved 100 percent ontime
completion of the standard of conduct training  a strong statement of acceptance of personal responsibility




                                                                                    corporate responsibility       15

in 2015 we launched a program on risk excellence including an
emphasis on the importance of speaking up and dealing transparently
with issues risk excellence is separately evaluated as part of our
performance review process and weve created incentives for self
reporting failures to follow our compliance policies through the end of
2015 34 percent of all instances of noncompliance with ethics policies
per month have been selfreported this is just one way weve              david suetens

how to succeed in business
                                                                           manages regulatory compliance and
                                                                           oversees the tools we use to ensure
financial institutions traditionally see client service and business
                                                                           risk practices globally across the
performance as the key components of success we consider risk             organization
excellence an equally important part at a time when financial
institutions are dealing with increased regulatory scrutiny risk
excellence is a vital part of how well we support our clients             its our fundamental belief that over
                                                                           the long term financial institutions
                                                                           that operate ethically and successfully
adoption of a risk aware culture                                           manage risk excellence will
                                                                           distinguish themselves in the
maintaining an ethical culture demands strong governance and               marketplace those that dont could
leadership from top management and because everyone must                  face tremendous reputational risk
understand their role we introduced risk excellence goals for every       which may endanger their ability to
employee in 2015 the types of risks an employee might come                remain in business
across can vary quite a bit depending on their position so these
goals have been tailored to make sure theyre applicable and
achievable within the broader risk excellence framework


learning from our mistakes

in any servicebased business mistakes are made and incidents
occur we want to make sure we respond to these situations in a
transparent timely and effective way  every time we expect
personal accountability and reward employees who quickly identify
escalate and respond to incidents

to gain insight and avoid repeating mistakes we share lessons
learned from handling incidence cases through our risk excellence
governance this can be challenging as we often have to break
silos across business and geographic lines but the benefit is great
we improve our collective awareness of potential risks and solidify
our risk awareness this is essential for a business built on trust




                                                                                   corporate responsibility      16

creating value for clients and shareholders
lasting mutually beneficial relationships with both our clients and shareholders are at the foundation of our
success to meet our clients emerging challenges we continually look at how we support them and the solutions
we offer this includes financial products and services that embed environmental social and governance esg
features in their design when it comes to our shareholders we maintain close relationships to make sure they
understand our goals how we plan to get there and our progress along the way

client experience and feedback
staying in touch

our clients expect excellent service  every day to deliver on that promise weve worked for many years with
national quality review nqr tools to see what our clients think about the quality of our work and where we can
make improvements

these surveys differ by region in terms of approach areas measured and client feedback for example in emea
the results showed that we continue to maintain our strong level of overall satisfaction clients highlighted
regulatory change and tax reporting as areas where they would like to see even more insights from us

building lasting relationships

in 2014 we piloted a program with 10 of our largest global asset management clients who we support through our
global relationship management grm team in contrast to the nqr surveys which are focused on general
satisfaction levels we opted to use the net promoter system nps with these select clients the nps survey
addresses three areas commercial conditions state street as an organization and our service quality most
importantly it asks if the client  based on their experience of working with us  would be willing to act as an
advocate for our company the bar is high on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most positive only a rating of 9
or 10 is counted as a positive result

for clients who we surveyed for the second year using nps we saw clear improvements in overall scores in the
number of individual promoters more than doubling and the attributes we measured also more people
participated in the survey this year at each client nps can support our relationships with a wider group within a
clients organization often even engaging a clients entire csuite this helps us build lasting relationships and
also fits well with our increasing focus on relationship governance together with the client were in a stronger
position to pinpoint what they value most and create a continuous focus for dialogue and improvement in 2015 we
also included in the nps pilot a number of strategic clients headquartered in europe and asia

valuing thought leadership

weve learned that once service quality is addressed one of the next areas clients value is thought leadership in
surveys clients have told us that they cant find the critical insights we offer anywhere else

for example they can tap into our experience with disruptive technologies from state street global exchange
ssgx access to white papers on current industry challenges as well as future trends also gives our clients a
stronger understanding of the markets they operate in and with marketing automation and client relationship
tools we can see what information clients most actively use so that we can respond to their individual needs




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      17

where thought leadership is of interest to a client we can invite them to talk with the authors of our white papers
or to speak to other experts on our team we also share insights into what has worked for us and for other clients
regarding geographic expansion product development and topics such as technology regulation risk and
distribution also our strong engagement in community and environmental protection is compelling to many
clients who are developing their own responsibility programs weve even seen an increase on these topics in
rfps

ethical marketing and fair competition
building a foundation of trust

as a partner to some of the worlds leading institutions we must constantly earn their trust our commitment to
honest and transparent operations is not only in the work we do for our clients and shareholders its part of how
we market our services and communicate our mission to the public

our recently revised global standard of conduct clearly prohibits misrepresenting any material facts and requires
that employees understand and uphold the laws regarding crossselling and bundling of products and services

marketing ethically

in 2015 we launched a new multilevel compliance program we made marketing compliance a key area for
strengthening our risk excellence and provided additional resources for achieving this compliance the new
resources included a stronger compliance oversight program cop for ethical marketing and creating the new
role of a marketing risk and compliance program manager

as part of the training on our new global ethical decisionmaking framework we developed ethical dilemma
scenarios and added them to the ethics training library for all businesses also our new global marketing and
advertising committee helps us uphold our transparent disclosures on the products and services we offer

avoiding improper gifts

while modest gifts and entertainment can help personalize business relationships we strictly prohibit our
employees from giving or receiving anything of value in exchange for or the perception of a specific business
advantage

we have a strict annual limit of us250 for gifts given to an individual and any gift or entertainment offered to a
public employee or us union official requires prior approval we train employees across the company to make
sure they clearly understand their responsibility when entertaining clients or prospects

upholding fair competition

we want our clients to select their financial services providers in a transparent and efficient market environment
our standard of conduct clearly prohibits all employees from engaging in any unfair competitive actions or
misusing a clients confidential information

employees must get advance approval from our chief legal officer or general counsel before discussing pricing
strategies with any competitors or entering into agreements concerning market opportunities employees are
only allowed to acquire competitive information and market data from public sources and through lawful means




                                                                                     corporate responsibility          18

data protection and privacy
using smart data analytics to our advantage

our clients navigate large volumes of data to make informed investment decisions by capturing and analyzing
data in a meaningful way we help them assess risk and forecast performance to make sure were staying ahead
of the curve when it comes to gathering and protecting data we continue to evaluate and implement protection
technologies across the company


carefully managing data

with a business based on trust our clients must feel confident in our ability to keep data confidential and uphold
their privacy we have several programs in place to maintain strict protocols for how we handle data and manage
our it systems

to handle data appropriately our information security controls require data to be classified as highly confidential
personal sensitive confidential limited access company internal or general data in late 2015 we introduced a
pilot program with a new tool to automate this classification process reducing the potential for misclassification
and inadvertent data disclosure over the next two years we plan to roll out other data protection tools that will
deliver additional access management encryption and revocation features corresponding to the associated
classification levels


safeguarding data from external threats

our data loss protection program includes technical tools and business processes that monitor and mitigate the
risk of data leakage for example endpoint protection software provides threat detection and analysis of activity
and our shadow it program detects communication to external sites and controls undesirable activity and data
exfiltration




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      19

esg financial solutions

several parts of our business incorporate esg strategies in their
work we spoke with four executives from across the organization
about the opportunities esg financial solutions provide for our clients
and our company
                                                                          chris mcknett

                                                                          reflect their esg views in their
integrate esg factors into broader investment practices we also
                                                                          investments
provide insights to the marketplace for example we led the
industry collaborative project delphi that together with academic
partners uncovers esg impacts on investment portfolios the first
phase of the delphi project wrapped up in december 2015 and the
findings will be available in 2016

we have 17 esg products on the market right now we first started
managing esg portfolios in 1986 and introduced our first fund in
1996 we launched the latest  a fossil fuelfree exchange traded
fund etf based on the sp 500 fossil fuel free index  at the           jake rosenfeld
end of 2015                                                              is a senior vice president and senior tax
                                                                          counsel at state street and the head of
q why did you introduce the fossilfree fund
                                                                          taxadvantaged investments these
mcknett a year ago we launched a lowcarbon equity etf it was          investments made on behalf of state
the first of its kind in the market and met clear client needs but       street include lowincome housing and
some investors such as a number of university endowments                renewable energy projects

foundations and individuals that aim to divest from firms with fossil
fuel reserves want to go beyond low carbon

different investment styles work for different clients in esg
financial services negative screening to avoid unwanted exposure
has been around for a long time positive selection to gain exposure
to sustainability themes such as low carbon or green bonds was
added later there is also an increasing move toward using esg
factors to capture intangible offbalancesheet values in broader
investment strategies




                                                                                   corporate responsibility      20

q are there other pieces to the esg puzzle
batler in municipal finance our clients seek to fund infrastructure
projects including capital improvement plans cip directly with us
or via the public markets an increasing number of public issuers
cips include infrastructure projects that address environmental or
social issues for example the san francisco public utility               mark mcdivitt

commission has a cip that includes construction of green                   is a managing director and the head of
infrastructure projects in the city and county                            us hedge fund sales focused on foreign
                                                                           exchange fx at state street his
rosenfeld also our own taxadvantaged investments help finance           responsibilities include the execution of
social issues such as lowincome housing and environmental                 the companys renewable energy and
                                                                           carbon offset transactions
causes such as renewable energy energy is increasingly generated
by privately financed providers that sell to public utilities we can
provide project financing to these generators in addition to our
support for municipal utility clients this lets us bridge both sides of
the renewable energy equation

mcdivitt renewable energy certificates recs can also help we
provide trading solutions for recs that help clients monetize
environmental attributes of renewable electricity generation
separately from the electricity itself recs can be embedded into
                                                                           tim batler

q what do you see on the horizon                                         costeffective financing either in the
batler we need to check for new risk factors in municipal bonds          bank or municipal bond markets

this goes beyond credit ratings and includes for example
dependency on coal there are also upcoming mandates to source
certain amounts of the energy offered by some utilities from
renewables this will likely change which new energy facilities get
built and the market demand for recs or alternative energy




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      21

rosenfeld in december 2015 the us congress extended tax credits for wind and solar projects for several years
we believe this extension coupled with state renewables mandates and international initiatives such as the paris
climate change accord will help spur a significant growth in the renewable sector that will lead to a
corresponding need for financing in the coming years

mcdivitt across the company were starting to hear clients ask for better coordinated esg financial solutions i
would expect there to be more and more opportunities for our different groups to work together to meet their
needs

q if you could choose one thing youd like to do what would that be
mcdivitt it would be very powerful to bring all our disciplines that can support esg solutions together lets link
our capabilities on environmental asset administration portfolio risk analysis lowrisk trading and green
investment management to figure out how to help our clients solve esg issues

we have a big chance here and a huge potential commercial opportunity that being said we also have the risk of
missing the boat we could lose out to competitors who are aggressively focusing on esg capabilities if were
playing this too defensively

mcknett there are some questions on how esg can be best monetized because its a heterogeneous category
one area where we see clear emerging interest from clients is in viewing esg factors and sustainability themes as
longterm drivers of investment performance and a component of rigorous investment philosophy and process
provided we have strong support from senior management and our board were in an excellent position to offer
uniquely integrated esg solutions




                                                                                     corporate responsibility        22

asset stewardship
more than 400 billion flowed into usbased passive funds in 2015
unlike active managers who can sell companies when they
disagree with management passive managers represent near
permanent capital that cannot vote with its feet  as long as a
company is included in the index it remains in the portfolio thats

why we think passive managers have a clear responsibility to be
                                                                       head of corporate governance

shareholder value

in 2014 we introduced new esg portfolio screening tools to help
actively identify companies for engagement and enhance oversight
of esg risk at portfolio companies in 2015 we engaged a total of
636 global companies representing more than 45 percent of our
assets on esg issues

increasing transparency on esg efforts to clients

annually ssga develops a series of strategic priorities that drive
our engagement with portfolio companies based on developing
macroeconomic conditions emerging esg trends and client
feedback a significant challenge for all passive index managers
invested in thousands of listed companies globally is to provide
active oversight of the company a sector approach lets us take a
deep dive into two to three sectors a year and proactively monitor
and engage companies on matters such as longterm strategy
performance and esg issues




                                                                               corporate responsibility      25

reviewing global holdings within a sector lets us identify business and esg trends impacting our holdings and
puts us in a stronger position to advise boards and management teams when they seek feedback or direction from
large institutional investors we also share our insights with clients through presentations and report our findings
in our annual stewardship report


for 2015 ssgas stewardship priorities included a sector focus on pharmaceutical companies which have to
navigate structural change in their sector due to an increase in mergers and acquisitions and the consumer
discretionary sector where macroeconomic and exchangerate challenges impact business strategy we worked
with companies on board refreshment and diversity cybersecurity threats and climate change as priority topics in
addition we focused on us proxy access issues and worked on developing a stewardship program for our fixed
income assets


contributing to esg best practices

weve taken a leadership position in the market and share our lessons learned with the wider investment
community through white papers available on our ssga website our evolving approach to esg has contributed to
the development and broader acceptance of best practices


one example is board refreshment  a key aspect of effective governance in 2014 we were the first major
investor to adopt a policy to address these practices at us portfolio companies through this policy weve raised
awareness about the need for the orderly succession of directors and fresh skills and expertise




                                                                                    corporate responsibility         26

economic performance

to create value for our shareholders were focused on generating consistent revenue growth and maintaining
disciplined expenses the economic success of our business also determines our ability to serve all stakeholders
with this in mind we manage the risks inherent in our business with systems procedures and oversight to
maintain transparency and longterm sustainability


revenue increase despite lower global interest rates

our total revenue in 2015 increased by one percent over 2014 this was mainly due to increases in our fee revenue
partially offset by a decline in net interest revenue


servicing and management fees were approximately 76 percent of our total fee revenue the remainder was due to
trading services securities finance and processing and other fees in 2015 total fee revenue increased by three
percent compared to 2014 in contrast net interest revenue decreased by eight percent on a fully taxable
equivalent basis in 2015 compared to 2014 contributing factors were our efforts to optimize our capital position to
comply with evolving regulatory requirements on liquidity lower yields on interestearning assets and the effect of
the stronger us dollar


increasing expenses and new cost efficiency program

total expenses in 2015 increased by three percent compared to 2014 primarily driven by an increase in expenses
due to more than 400 million in legal accruals as well as higher information systems and communications costs
to support new business and other expenses from professional services this was partially offset by a 108 million
decrease in acquisition and restructuring costs and 251 million from the effect of the stronger us dollar


in october 2015 we announced the next phase of our multiyear transformation program which we refer to as
state street beacon we expect to deliver cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and
further digitize our processes and interfaces with clients we expect state street beacon which includes the
targeted staff reductions that we announced with our thirdquarter 2015 results to generate approximately 550
million in estimated annualized pretax expense savings over the next five years including approximately 75
million in 2016


dividend increase and stable return on equity

during 2015 we declared common stock dividends of 132 per share 2014 116 totaling approximately 536
million return on average common shareholders equity remained flat at 98 percent in 2015 compared to 2014
we purchased approximately 205 million shares of our common stock at an average pershare cost of 7407 and
an aggregate cost of approximately 152 billion

issues

talent recruitment and retention

as the business world grows companies are competing for the same skilled workers to attract and keep the best
candidates were developing a new recruitment branding campaign to refine our image and the message were
delivering to potential employees with this new campaign we explain how our more than 200yearold custodian
bank can offer opportunities that are interesting and rewarding

diversifying our talent

a diverse workforce inspires innovation and creates better business results in 2015 we hired 12 fulltime
employees  eight in north america two in emea and two in apac  to form a global diversity sourcing team to
bring diverse talent into higherlevel roles all of the team members completed specialized recruitment training
and received their diversity recruiting certification for more on our initiatives to foster diversity see pages 34

the role of recruitment programs

our employees help our company grow and stay innovative our hiring increased significantly in 2015 across
strategic business areas including regulatory compliance technology and analytics showing our commitment to

our future focus program in the us which began in 2014 increased the rigor of our entrylevel recruitment in its
first year it brought 26 highcaliber candidates into the company and in 2015 more than 120 were hired through
the program

we also expanded our internship programs in 2015 to more than 1100 participants in emea we offered a number
of internship opportunities to help undergraduates prepare for a career in financial services and to strengthen our
pipeline for future entrylevel roles in apac we offered university students from nanyang polytechnic in
singapore sixmonth internships polytechnic grants them academic credit for the experience which speaks to the
quality of our program




                                                                                      corporate responsibility       30

the gap between open jobs and the talent we need to fill them will continue to be a challenge for us programs like
future focus and our boston workforce investment network wins initiative which supports innercity youth in
education and job readiness see pages 4446 will help us close that gap continuing to craft our image as an
exciting and fulfilling place to work and sharing our story will give us an edge in the race


training and professional development

by offering numerous avenues for professional development our employees are able to deepen their skills our
clients receive even better service and our company continues to evolve


managers as students

in 2015 we analyzed where our managers needed more support as a result we piloted our first line leader
program for new managers in december 2015 and laid the groundwork to launch the program globally in 2016
we also updated our most popular management classes in 2015 data showed that employees who took these
classes had higher performance scores higher rates of promotions and were more internally mobile




                                                                                  corporate responsibility      31

                                                                        number of people i ever met within the
this year were planning a major update in 2017 to make our
                                                                        organization to request information or

                                                                        your comfort zone it stretches you the
encouraging collaboration                                               most

to encourage collaboration across the company we created a
crossenterprise learning council this year this council bridges
all the groups in the company that support employee learning so
they can coordinate efforts and improve our educational
opportunities we also redesigned an internal site  managing my
team to help managers tap into the information they need when
they need it use of the site skyrocketed by 90 percent after the
redesign




                                                                                corporate responsibility       32

wage equity and flexible work options
upholding wage equity and equal opportunity

the ratio of wages of our female employees compared to our male employees in the company is material to our
business and of interest to our stakeholders however we do not report a females basic salary as a percentage to
a males a simple acrosstheboard analysis of an organization of state streets size and multiple businessline
complexity would not accurately compare similar positions or capture all elements of a total compensation
program

successful companies actively ensure that the visible and invisible barriers to advancement are identified and
removed  including closing the gender wage gap to that end in 2013 we signed the boston womens compact
which strives to make greater boston the premier place for working women in america state street is executing the
objectives of the compact in several ways by setting organizational goals for diversity by mentoring women in
leadership roles engaging them in our employee networks and through our flexible work initiative


increasing engagement and productivity

highly skilled productive employees are vital to our success we believe that offering flexibility in how when and
where work gets done increases the engagement and productivity of our workforce flex work may include a
consolidated schedule as well as working remotely or at a satellite office and job share opportunities allow more
than one employee to share a position on an ongoing basis


providing support and guidance

benefits from flexible work can include enhanced worklife balance and time and cost savings from commuting
the flex work program is integrated with our business strategy and has developed into a proactive manager
initiated program supported by tools technologies and resources

our flexible work employee network is an inclusive collection of employees who voluntarily work together to
support our global workforce around state streets formal flex work program for example the network provides
career development guidance and support to flex community followers to help them in career advancement
internal mobility and becoming the voice of flex in their area in 2015 our flexible work employee network was
ranked no 7 on the top 25 employee resource groups by the association of employee resource groups and
diversity councils this affirms the networks commitment to best practices and organizational impact




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      33

diversity and inclusion
we spoke with julie haskell about the role diversity and inclusion play
in staying competitive and the strides were making to enhance this
aspect of our culture

q how do you define diversity in the workplace
diversity refers to the visible and invisible traits that make us all     julianne haskell
                                                                          managing director global
unique its about the variety of different backgrounds perspectives
                                                                          inclusion and diversity
experiences and worldviews within our organization its equally
important however to promote an understanding of inclusion             julie leads our initiatives on inclusion
                                                                          diversity and worklife balance as part
inclusion is created by a set of behaviors and how we feel at work
                                                                          of this role she oversees our employee
its the act of soliciting and respecting diverse perspectives to         resource groups employee surveys and
promote engagement innovation and constructive debate  all key          programs to meet our diversity and
                                                                          inclusion goals
to creating a risk excellence culture

diversity and inclusion are most valuable when present together
by itself a diverse workforce doesnt change culture providing
opportunities that let employees use their unique perspectives and
backgrounds is how we create real business value we want
employees to recognize and embrace all dimensions of diversity
and then work to create an inclusive environment where everyone
can perform at their best

q where do you see change
in the short time since we embraced this definition of diversity
weve already seen positive outcomes heres just one example we
know that in some asian cultures certain forms of diversity are not
usually expressed in public in the past very few of our asian
colleagues were willing to identify with the lesbian gay bisexual
and transgender lgbt community during the annual hong kong
pride parade last year however we were pleased to see more
than 20 employees participate in the parade the kickoff event of
hong kong pride and friends network attracted more than 70
attendees including senior management our message is being
heard




                                                                                   corporate responsibility      34

q what steps are being taken at state street to support an inclusive and diverse workplace
we want to create an environment where people of all backgrounds and experiences can succeed three key
components of our effort are to

       establish our leaders as champions of diversity and inclusion and give them the tools and resources to
        help convey the importance and business value of a diverse workforce
       ensure that were building a sustainable pipeline of diverse talent for leadership positions
       implement a clear standard to hold leaders accountable for creating a diverse workforce and behaving
        inclusively

one way we celebrate and support our differences is through employee networks open to all employees these
networks create volunteer career development and cultural opportunities state street supports 23 employee
established networks and affinity groups with more than 100 chapters globally

q what are your plans for maintaining diversity and inclusion over the long term
building a truly diverse and inclusive workforce is a journey for any company last year we took a big step by
introducing a threeyear strategy to educate employees shift behavior and embed these elements throughout the
company

weve already made progress in 2015 by setting new goals establishing an approach to report progress sourcing
diverse talent from within and improving leadership opportunities for internal talent well continue to analyze the
success of our diversity and inclusion efforts through our biennial employee opinion survey and by participating in
external surveys that allow us to benchmark ourselves against our peers




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      35

supplier assessment
identifying the best partners

our global procurement services gps team works tirelessly to identify highquality costeffective flexible
suppliers that help us operate and serve our clients efficiently in 2015 we spent about 39 billion globally on
products and services including financial it business and professional services and market data travel
management and office support

the team also sets procurement standards identifies suitable suppliers and negotiates favorable price and
contract terms it pinpoints the bestinclass processes technology and tools that will help us reach our
spending and risk management objectives in addition it selects suppliers that support our drive for social
responsibility


striving for responsibility

wherever possible we choose to work with suppliers who offer products and services that will reduce our overall
environmental footprint as part of our environmentally preferable purchasing program eppp in cases where
the ecofriendly solution is more costly however we have to manage tradeoffs between environmental and
economic goals

in 2015 we expanded our eppp goals related to our it purchases and disposals these goals include the
prioritization of purchasing energy starcertified devices and working with vendors that have a product
recycling or takeback program the eppp is currently focused on direct suppliers in north america and emea
and we hope to expand its scope in 2016 going forward we also want to explore including secondtier suppliers
used by our major vendors in addition we screen new suppliers in north america for environmental and ethical
aspects in our rfp process


exploring local sourcing

when scale and cost permit we use local suppliers whenever we can if our global business needs limit our
options for local sourcing we encourage our larger global suppliers to use local secondtier vendors if they can

starting in 2016 we plan to explore including local sourcing questions in our global procurements rfp process
in addition we plan to monitor which secondtier vendors our larger suppliers use well also explore how local
sourcing and our supplier diversity program  which measures and encourages sourcing from businesses owned
by minorities veterans and women  can support each other




                                                                                     corporate responsibility        37

supporting communities and the environment
actively engaging our global communities is one of our fundamental values and is one reason why our
commitment to social and environmental responsibility is a cornerstone of our longterm success since 2014
weve been a signatory to the united nations global compact  a global initiative uniting organizations to help
build prosperous societies these organizations believe responsible business practices create a stable equitable
and inclusive global market with the same rigor we apply to our business we use our resources  both human
and financial  to support our communities not only are we committed to using these resources responsibly to
protect the environment we know we can use them to attract and retain clients and employees and reduce costs


prosperity and financial security
at the center of the global economy

as of december 31 2015 we had 28 trillion of assets under custody and administration and 2 trillion of assets
under management our position at the center of the worlds financial markets comes with responsibility 
something we never take lightly

we help clients make the right connections bringing opportunities into focus and paving the way ahead whether
they are based in the most established markets or in those just emerging the e7 a group of seven emerging
economies will have close to 50 percent of global banking assets by 2050 it held less than 20 percent in 2013 to
meet the demand fueled by this globalization were committed to global expansion and further integration of our
products and services


enabling graceful retirement

our strong pension fund services help many people around the world retire gracefully pension funds have often
been expected to play a conservative role in the financial system as longterm investors as the current investment
climate leads them to consider new strategies to deliver value to their members we help them navigate the
challenges in the financial landscape and provide comprehensive investment management solutions such as
targetdate funds


creating local jobs

with more than 32000 employees globally we help to create job opportunities in the communities where we live
and work the new staff we hire comes mostly from the local community for example at the level of senior vice
president and above 31 of the 35 new hires in 2015 were local a significant number of local jobs will also become
available through our boston wins project see pages 4446 over the upcoming years




 assets under management include approximately 22 billion as of december 31 2015 for which state street global markets llc

stories from causes they support in 2015 stories came from more than 150 events organized by our corporate
citizenship team our community support program committees and our business teams these inspirational
events included collections for syrian refugees in ireland italy and germany chasing ice events to raise climate

will help prepare boston youth for sustainable employment

q what is boston wins and what led you to introduce this
program
we launched the boston workforce investment network wins         michael scannell
                                                                   senior vice president human
in june 2015 to support boston youth in education and
                                                                   resources
workforce preparation
                                                                   in addition to overseeing state streets
when i took on responsibility of corporate citizenship in early    corporate citizenship talent
                                                                   acquisition and global inclusion areas
2014 a new vision for the state street foundation our
                                                                   mike serves as the president of the
charitable arm for over 37 years was beginning to take shape     state street foundation our
our chairman and ceo jay hooley challenged us to think           charitable arm
differently about our approach to corporate philanthropy and to
reconsider how we could deliver the greatest impact for each
dollar invested so i went back to our foundation team and we
got to work we decided to focus our efforts on education and
preparing disadvantaged young people for employment

in a given year we used to contribute hundreds of grants
boston wins helped us narrow our focus its an opportunity to
be involved with our nonprofit partners over a longer term and
accelerate our impact on education and workforce development
the ultimate goal is to increase the number of careerready
youth in boston

q how is boston wins structured
five nonprofit organizations targeting innercity boston youth
are involved we selected these organizations  year up
bottom line boston pic uaspire and college advising corps 
after thorough due diligence we wanted to engage
organizations with strong leadership that shared our vision who
were willing to collaborate and could use our contributions in a
meaningful way




                                                                           corporate responsibility      44

with the right group of organizations we knew we could offer more substantial contributions and provide a
platform for improved collaboration that would offer greater value to the community the program involves three
main contributions from us we provide 20 million over the next four years to our group of partner organizations
we pledge to hire 1000 individuals served by these organizations over the same time and we commit to staying
involved this includes having state street leaders hold board of director positions encouraging our employees to
volunteer and offering a 2to1 match of employee donations to these organizations


q what would make boston wins a success story
we want to make a significant impact on education and career success for boston youth with this gamechanging
corporate philanthropy initiative to help us succeed were outlining our expectations and have engaged a network
partner to help facilitate meetings so we can all remain in alignment and track outcomes

as this program gets in full swing well learn from the experience for engagements beyond the boston area our
hope is to take those lessons learned and use the blueprint of boston wins to potentially introduce a similar
program in other parts of the world where we operate




                                                                                   corporate responsibility      45

reducing for the long term

as part of our responsibility to protect social wellbeing and our planet in 2013 we committed to reducing our
greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 20 percent per person by 2020 compared to a 2012 baseline in 2015 we
continued to make substantial progress toward our goal at the end of the year we had achieved a 17 percent
reduction in ghg emissions this reduction was primarily due to our increased occupancy of more efficient office
space a favorable change in emissions factors used in calculations and an increase in the overall number of
employees against which emissions are factored

our environmental data shows the main source of our ghg emissions is the energy we use in our operations
followed by emissions from employee commuting and business travel by focusing on our operations while
supporting sustainable commuting options and flexible work solutions that reduce commuting were creating
significant change that brings us ever closer to our goals to further mitigate the impact of our global business
travel our investment in a wind power project near our new office in gdansk poland offset 26000 metric tons of
carbon impact from our 2014 business travel


making progress creating challenges

weve made great progress in the last few years in our energy efficiency however this has brought its challenges
to make further progress well keep tabs on technology and infrastructure innovations to find new opportunities
to reduce emissions

our new global energy policy will support us as well as new certifications to the global iso 50001 energy
management standard in 2015 our offices in dublin edinburgh and london were certified to this standard as
part of our global expansion we opened a new office in gdansk poland in february 2016 we realize that using
larger premises will also increase emissions to mitigate the emissions from this additional office space we
chose an energyefficient leed platinum precertified building we also continued work on data center
virtualization to avoid emissions increases as it requirements grow in response to a regulatory requirement
defined in the european energy efficiency directive we also completed energy audits in seven eu office locations
operations in the uk were covered by our iso 50001 energy management certification

receiving recognition for our efforts

in 2015 the us environmental protection agency epa recognized us as one of the nations top 100 purchasers of
green power for our purchase of 211 million kilowatthours kwh of greene certified recs covering state
streets 2014 purchased electricity in the us to continue the program we purchased another 202 million kwh
representing 110 percent of purchased electricity in 2015

we were also recognized in 2015 by cdp a notforprofit organization supporting environmental impact
disclosures by major corporations for achieving its alevel of ghg emissions performance we were also included
in cdps leadership index for achieving a score of 99 out of 100 for our environmental disclosures




                                                                                   corporate responsibility      48

impacts of climate change
strengthening risk excellence

we focus on managing risk in everything we do as a signatory to the united nations global compact were
specifically committed to a precautionary approach to environmental challenges also our iso 14001 certification
at 17 of our largest operations globally requires us to evaluate environmental risks over the long term

in 2015 our office of environmental sustainability developed an environmental risk excellence matrix that
evaluated strategic and market risks regulatory risks reputational risks and physical risks while climate change
isnt a major risk to our operations right now we identified certain risks and mitigation strategies primarily
involving strategic and reputational risk well continue to diligently monitor and evaluate these and the other risks
we identified

turning strategic and market risks into opportunities

many market players see carbonrelated assets as an increasing risk factor for their investments for example
fossil fuel assets could become stranded if new regulations prohibit their extraction or if the cost of lowcarbon
substitutes declines it could impact share values of companies that own them clients may seek new ways to
protect themselves from such risks

our strong focus on environmental financial solutions turns these risks into opportunities products like our low
carbon exchange traded fund etf and our new fossil fuelfree etf together with esg screening strategies give
us a leading position in the market for more information on our esg financial solutions see pages 2024


mitigating regulatory and reputational risks

increasing global and regional climate regulations might require us to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions
even beyond our voluntary commitments and clients analysts and industry rankings may put more pressure on
us to demonstrate climate leadership

but were prepared were committed to our 20 percent carbon reduction goal see page 47 and continuously
monitor our progress our iso 14001 risk reviews and the work of our regulatory industry and government affairs
team keep us well informed on new regulations relevant to our business our public disclosures on corporate
responsibility including this report make sure we tell a clear story on our sustainability initiatives


maintaining business continuity

a business continuity event  big or small  can impact any business with physical operations climate change
can contribute to such physical risks for example through more frequent severe weather events or sea level rise
as financial services centers around the world are often by or near the coastline our peers and our own company
may be impacted by these risks

we assess and observe such risks in our iso 14001 risk reviews and risk register our global continuity services
team leads our efforts to ensure continuity of our operations in the event of a business interruption were
committed to protecting our clients from any service interruptions including those related to climate change in
addition to taking responsibility for mitigating our own climate impacts




                                                                                     corporate responsibility      49

        representing the following offices global human resources esg investing cbre real estate services
        for the ghg and environmental data corporate social responsibility procurement and compliance 
        ethics
       interviews with relevant staff to understand and evaluate the data management systems and processes
        including it systems and internal review processes used for collecting and reporting the selected data




                                                                                     corporate responsibility       54

         for the selected environmental data interviews with the external consultant cbre responsible for collecting
          and consolidating utility data across state streets operations as well as a review of the completeness and
          accuracy of the data including unit and emission conversion factors for energy use and ghg emissions the
          reasonableness of estimations and extrapolations and the accuracy of the consolidation
         a check of the consistency of the financial data with state streets 2015 10k submission for the relevant data
         for the selected information a review of the consistency of reporting in the cr report with the
          information in the 2015 gri g4 report
the limitations of our assurance engagement
for the financial data we have restricted our work to checking consistency with the audited state street annual
report on form 10k for the year ending december 31 2015 for the relevant data we have not assured personal
views expressed in the letters and interviews incorporated in the cr report our work was restricted to the 2015
reporting year so no assurance is given on prior year data or on future performance or expectations the
reliability of the assured data is subject to inherent uncertainties given the available methods for determining
calculating or estimating the underlying information
our conclusions
based on our activities nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the selected information in the state
street 2015 cr reporting as described under the scope above is not fairly presented in all material respects
with the reporting criteria

our observations
we have provided state street with a separate detailed management report without affecting the conclusions
presented above we have the following key observations
     state street has further developed its stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment during 2015 it
       has used these as a basis for building the cr report around the 15 material cr topics identified in these
       processes providing more focus for this years cr report however we note that the cr report does not
       always include disclosure of the management approach gri dma and the 2015 performance gri
       indicators for each material topic so users need to reference the information in the state street gri g4
       report to obtain a more comprehensive picture we therefore recommend that state street considers
       publishing a fully standalone cr report next year including the dma elements and key annual
       performance for each material topic in addition to insets with interviews or more qualitative information
     while state street has included more graphics in the cr report this year a number of key performance data
       are reported in the text and are for 2015 only rather than in comparison to the prior years performance we
       recommend the consistent use of multiyear graphs for the presentation of key performance indicators for
       each material topic in next years report to give the user a clear picture of performance over time
