    progress under the mediumterm management plan

in this section president kudo discusses progress towards curbing fluctuation risk and generating stable earnings
key tasks of the mediumterm management plan


1 curbing fluctuation risk
the nyk groups measures to curb fluctuation risk were successful
and improved profitability dramatically

unfortunately eliminating the containership supply             immediately after the start of the global recession
demand gapthe widest among all vessel types                 we moved towards a lightasset business model for
is liable to take several years because even now the          containerships which was the correct response to de
completion of new vessels is continuing containership        mand volatility further in the fiscal year under review
operators appear to have reacted by laying up surplus         we exploited it and other innovations to enable rigorous
vessels and introducing slowsteaming operations nev        cost reduction shrinking our deficit in the liner trade
ertheless even if vessels are laid up fixed costs remain   segment significantly from more than 400 billion to
and i think this is making balancing income and expen        94 billionan impressive achievement
diture challenging


2 generating stable earnings

the nyk group steadily accumulated longterm contracts

mainly through the lng transport business and the             natural gas extracted from gasrich shale in response the
shuttle tanker business which transports crude oil from      nyk group plans to add between 30 and 40 operating
offshore installations to onshore facilities we continu     lng carriers to its fleet in addition we became the first
ously secured longterm contracts amid the growing           japanese shipping company to acquire an equity
shale gas revolution in north america the lng transport      interest in a natural gas development project in june 2012
business is seeing a rise in the number of japanese           i feel this is a milestone not only because of the lng
companies interested in importing unconventional              transport opportunities it presents us but also because it

    1 strengthening balance sheet management                                         volatility when the exchange rate was less than 80 to the us
    i mentioned that the group raised funds in advance during the                     dollar changing these percentages significantly was difficult
    fiscal year under review however we did not just raise funds we                however the current exchange rate makes it an opportune time
    disposed of assets in particular responding to last years high                 to finally begin addressing this issue for most new vessel
    share prices we sold some investment securities which we had                    orders the group has already raised funds mainly in foreign
    not been selling a lot of due to slumping share prices to the                    currency denominations therefore we plan to shift payments
    extent that operations are not affected the group intends to                     towards foreign currency denominations primarily by refinancing
    continue such measures                                                           past investments

    at present the groups foreign currency denominated                              the group has almost finished building a central financing
    transactions are not balanced while approximately 90 of                         system in some cases we may raise funds for individual vessels
    revenues are foreign currency denominated only about 80 of                      but we are establishing a system that raises longterm funds when
    payments are foreign currency denominated by redressing this                     interest rates are advantageous as i mentioned and allocates
    imbalance we aim to become less susceptible to exchange rate                     funds to each vessel

okina in my view the group should enable each employee to be            shipping plays i feel employees should be more aware of this
more aware that its mainstay business benefits society shipping          value and emphasise it more to the outside world a lot of the nyk

fuel and food that are essential for everyday life international         the general public to get a real sense of shippings importance
shipping is designated as one of the industries that has to continue      however investors fully understand this point
even if there is a pandemic in japan this is how important a role

 q what is the importance of the nyk group mission statement also do you think the group has
   instilled it in employees sufficiently

okamoto i think the nyk group mission statement is exemplary            emphasis on supporting
however the group should keep in mind that even corporate                society by working for the
philosophies change due to social trends or business conditions          group is attractive
    inculcating the nyk group mission statement depends on                   when i speak with nyk
education in my view the group should further instil its vision in      group employees i am left
employees through inhouse training programs that said free             with an impression of strong

okina corporate philosophies play an important role in determin         statement with this in mind the group may need to innovate so

                                                   competitive new aircraft with japan unlikely to see significant increases

environmental accounting



the basic concept behind our environmental accounting is to correctly capture the expenses required for the protection
of the environment and repeatedly review our findings so that we can engage in appropriate environmental conservation
as a part of our business activities

    fiscal 2012 overview
as in fiscal 2011 the group focused efforts on developing innovative new technologies and advancing environmental protection activities however
costs decreased year on year because fewer vessels went into service in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 and installation costs for environmental
technologies that help prevent global warming and air pollution were lower
