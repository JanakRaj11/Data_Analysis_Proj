        to further ensure compliance with regulations and promote the adoption of good environmental
        practices among vendors third party legal and environmental audit of vendors has been started in the
        pantnagar waluj and chakan clusters also energy audit for one vendor in each cluster was
        undertaken in the presence of other vendors of the cluster this helped all of them identify best
        practices in energy efficiency and loss elimination as a result energy saving to the tune of 54 lakh
        units kwh was achieved in the year 201617

        enhancing the efficiency of processes has dual benefits it reduces their environmental impact while
        also effecting their cost efficiency in a positive way to reduce the cost of logistics bal focuses on the
        bill to ship to b2s2 initiative which has now been extended to the pantnagar cluster bal also

        due to its operations for this it works closely with its vendors who now supply more than 95 of the
        parts in reusable plastic bins and trollies by adopting the philosophy of continuous improvement the
        quantity of corrugated box material used for packaging has been reduced waste paint sludge
        generated in paint shops is burnt in incinerators to generate heat this simultaneously reduces the
        quantity of waste that needs to be disposed and the energy that needs to be procured
