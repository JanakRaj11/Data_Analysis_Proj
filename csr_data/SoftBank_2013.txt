     interview with the creator of the idea                        interview with store operations leader


   seeing my parents hardly ever                                 customer service from the
   using the ipad that i had given                               standpoint of seniors has
   them as a gift                                               gained favorable
   i came up with this idea                                     responses
                                                                 softbank mobile corp
  this all started with my parents i had given my
  parents an ipad as a gift but apparently they had not         yoshiaki sakuma
  been using it at all that struck me that the use of           senior vice president deputy head
  tablets and smartphones is a more challenging task for         head of sales operation division
                                                                 softbank mobile
  seniors than i had imagined i wondered what could
  be done to remove their psychological barrier and let
  them enjoy the use at ease  and that s when the idea          the senior crews in the ﬁeld are perceived well
  of senior crew came to me i ﬁgured that seniors               by customers and that is probably because they
  would feel hesitant to ask questions to younger                speak in the customers language for example
  people but would feel more comfortable asking the              smartphones jargon such as tap and pinch is
  same questions to crews of their own age the idea of          diﬃcult for seniors to understand the senior
  senior crew also appeared to be an interesting as it           crews explain these concepts using plain
  would lead to job creation for seniors so i entered it        language so senior customers feel like they are
              into the contest once the idea was                learning from an acquaintance and feel comfort
                selected we made a team of employees            able about communicating in fact the smart
                  who had come up with similar ideas             phone lectures that are conducted by the senior
                  and brushed up the concept to put it           crew are very popular and actually drive partici

                 idea i hope to see an increase in the          seeing mobile phones become an integrated part
