          recycling from global urban mines
         the roles and responsibilities of the mitsubishi materials group as we enter a
         new stage in resource recycling




          we hold stakeholders meetings in order to incorporate feedback from outside experts into our csr activities from a longterm perspective
          this year we held our sixth stakeholders meeting the meeting focused on recycling from urban mines as a key component in
          resource sustainability and reducing environmental impact this is one of our top priorities in terms of supporting recyclingoriented
          society as outlined in the vision behind our longterm management policy having invited experts with specialist knowledge in this
          field to attend the meeting started with a presentation on our home appliance and vehicle recycling operations focusing particularly
          on our core escrap recycling business we then received invaluable feedback and recommendations on subjects such as the role
          that we need to play and issues for the future
                                                                                scrap containing gold and silver consisting of crushed printed circuit boards from waste home appliances and electronic devices



                    points identified as important comments
                in terms of expanding recycling businesses it is important to provide national gov
                 ernments and official bodies with support to develop systems that will enable the
                 effective use of urban mines by providing information and policy recommendations
                 for instance it is also important to widely publicize the social value that such opera
                 tions provide using terms that are easy for consumers and members of the public
                 to understand

                                 as a company that is committed to resource recycling making the most of your wideranging business infrastructure
                                 from nonferrous smelting to cement mitsubishi materials is a hugely reassuring presence within the socalled venous
                                 industry this is a field in which you can make a real difference to tackling social issues above and beyond mere recycling
                                 activities by assisting with the adequate disposal of illegally dumped industrial waste in teshima kagawa prefecture
                                 for instance naoshima smelter  refinery or taking in waste left over from the great east japan earthquake as part of
                                 your cement operations id like to see you stepping up initiatives like that even further
                                    last year the ministry of the environment held a meeting for officials involved in the basel convention from countries
                                 throughout asia after the meeting officials went on a tour of your naoshima smelter  refinery and were able to see
facilities where escrap imported from asian countries is processed this was a crucial opportunity in terms of showcasing japanese initiatives as it
stands there are large volumes of waste home appliances and printed circuit boards being left unprocessed in countries across asia cfcs which are
used as a coolant are one of the causes of damage to the ozone layer and global warming but they are still not being adequately processed in some
parts of asia if you make the most of your existing technologies and processes i feel that there is real potential for you to expand your operations over
seas
    while it is impressive that you are aiming to secure a leading share of the world market for processing escrap looking further into the future it will
also be essential to support national governments and gain public understanding as part of that process it will be important to go about your business
activities in an open manner by providing information on negative aspects of your operations and risks rather than focusing solely on the positive as
well as sharing your initiatives and vision with a broad section of the public and lobbying the industry as a whole i hope that you will also do things
like create opportunities to discuss current issues and strengthen collaboration with governments and researchers


       viewing recycling operations from a global perspective and strengthening public information capabilities

                                 existing methods of waste disposal have certain limitations when it comes to tackling concerns regarding escrap being taken
                                 out of the country by inappropriate means nonetheless we are starting to see governments discussing compliance with the
                                 basel convention in relation to items such as waste electronic printed circuit boards
                                    even from an expert standpoint your escrap initiatives are fascinating and are having a real impact thats why it is impor
                                 tant to provide information on the role that your operations play within society as a whole in a manner that is easier for general
                                 consumers to understand maybe you could make a broader contribution to society by visiting schools or producing teaching
                                 materials for example or you could look into different forms of disclosure and step up publicity activities by showcasing the
                                 recycling process at your naoshima smelter  refinery on tv
    when we think about japanese society for the future i think its absolutely crucial that we reassess recycling from a global perspective taking into account
factors such as resource protection and nonproliferation given the significant differences between japan and the international community in terms of legisla
tion social systems and business practices not least in the eu it is important to keep a close eye on global trends at all times and to continue building
knowledge and expertise so that it can be fed back into your business strategy there is much discussion in the eu regarding benchmarks based on resource
efficiency re from the standpoint of sustainability and growth strategies if you want to promote your vision globally it would be beneficial to take factors
like that on board and explore possibilities for collaboration with manufacturers of end products


       it is crucial to set out an ideal vision for the future and to showcase your strengths and strategies

                                  i wonder whether many people actually know about the significant environmental effects of your recycling businesses and
                                  processes not least in terms of reducing co2 emissions it seems a shame not to tell as many consumers as possible about the
                                  value you offer from quantitative values such as processing volumes to qualitative values such as the efficiency and superior
                                  environmental credentials of the mitsubishi process
                                      i think you should also be engaging in more strategic communication activities with investors who are starting to take a
                                  real interest in esg environmental social and governance investment as well as your longterm vision you should be telling
                                  investors about unseen value and assets not included on your balance sheet such as your worldleading commitment to urban
                                  mines
    the need for a recyclingoriented society is going to keep on increasing in the future on a global scale the technique of backcasting has become common
place in the world of csr based on envisioning an ideal future and working back if you could set out a vision for your recycling businesses  such as we will
achieve a recycling rate of x by 2050 for instance  you could showcase your strengths and strategies on the way to achieving that i think that would make
your sustainable business strategy all the more persuasive
    i used to take part in the ministry of economy trade and industrys committee on revising the act on recycling of specified kinds of home appliances but
the importance of adequately recycling metal did not come up for discussion because it is already accepted as a given as you have such a wealth of expertise
in that respect i would hope to see you playing a leading role within the industry by actively lobbying government agencies and ministries regarding the social
significance of recycling metal

  selected materials that have been moved as a result of decontamination work to
  interim storage facilities we intend to continue developing technology for the
  treatment and disposal of contaminated soil and other such materials as well as

              als for our cement manufacturing facilities and vice versa
              we are also using this system which enables us to recycle escrap used home appliances and other waste products into

              bearing in mind our wideranging business activities here at the mitsubishi materials group we carry out environmental preservation
              activities in line with the nature of our operations and the characteristics of each area initiatives include preventing environmental
              contamination organizing drills to prevent contamination from spreading in the event of an accident and reducing waste

73   mitsubishi materials csr report 2015

    thirdparty assessment of the mitsubishi materials csr report 2015

having been given the opportunity to express my opinion once again id            als disclosing more specific details of strategies and initiatives in the future
like to say that this years report left me with a strong impression of being         another risk that the company needs to keep a close eye on is
a more strategic and balanced report than last year as a result of mitsubishi     management of closed mines these are essential behindthescenes
materials consolidating its material issues and reviewing priorities in line       activities requiring ongoing management in areas such as mine damage
with the companys core operations                                                and drainage despite the fact that mitsubishi materials has permanent
    from an outsiders perspective i would say that the most important            management staff at its 16 closed mines it has nonetheless reported on
material issue for mitsubishi materials is how to handle mineral resources      breaches and improvement measures relating to mine drainage at
    it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain resources from mines due to   osarizawa mine while it is important to reliably disclose negative
a whole host of issues such as the depletion of finite mineral resources          information like this to ensure trust we are seeing an increase in torrential
environmental destruction and human rights issues associated with mining           downpours strong winds and other abnormal weather conditions posing
as evidenced by conflict minerals and the rise of resource nationalism          even greater risks for closed mines not least pollution i would encourage
amongst resourceproducing countries at the same time however demand             mitsubishi materials to come up with new management ideas to prevent
for resources is on the increase due to globalization and economic growth in       any decline in morale amongst workers at closed mines
emerging and developing countries putting more and more pressure on                  business continuity depends on effective safety measures in highrisk
supply and demand there are social issues to address too including pollution     workplaces where workers are engaging in activities such as smelting using
from large volumes of used home appliances and other waste products               high temperature furnaces treating metals with chemicals or crushing
    with all that going on it is particularly impressive that this report         limestone by blasting the report mentions safety declaration day as a
emphasizes the strategic importance of resources and recycling from a              preventive measure following the explosion at the yokkaichi plant in
management standpoint the top interview mentions specific details about           january 2014 while it is deeply regrettable when a serious accident like this
recycling and reusing resources touching on the significance of the             occurs it is crucial to learn lessons and incorporate them into preventive
companys smelting and cement recycling system combining core                     measures and to reinforce safety awareness amongst all employees in
technologies in the fields of both smelting and cement manufacturing one          order to sustain business activities and honor those who lost their lives the
of the three core strategies under mitsubishi materials current                   report states that all employees stopped for a moment of silence at the time
mediumterm management plan is pursuing a recyclingoriented business             of the accident on safety declaration day one year on i hope that
model central to that are the companys urban mine initiatives the social       mitsubishi materials will maintain such a high level of safety awareness as
and corporate significance of which are covered in great detail in the             part of its companywide dna and not let initiatives such as this become
reports special feature                                                          mere formalities
    i have high hopes for the future in terms of seeing how this                     in terms of the companys diversity strategy meanwhile the report
recyclingoriented business model grows and develops over time both on            mentions that mitsubishi materials has set targets for promoting greater
a quantitative and qualitative basis and how the company advances its             roles for women and is working to harness foreign human resources in the
commitment to responsible procurement of raw materials responsibility            era of abenomics there is a sense that society is changing faster than
throughout the value chain with regard to the former approach it would         anyone could have expected mitsubishi materials will be in competition
perhaps be wise to refer to exchanges of opinions with various different           with other companies and industries to identify and recruit talented human
outside stakeholders rather than merely discussing options inhouse the           resources too so i hope to see further initiatives in this area in the future
companys first esg meeting for investors in july was a prime example with
regard to the latter approach mitsubishi materials will need to extend                                      mariko kawaguchi
