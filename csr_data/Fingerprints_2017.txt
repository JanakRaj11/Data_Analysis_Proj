taken for granted
the application of biometrics has already been proven on a large
scale in smartphones trust in the functionality creates
a platform for applications in more devices such as smart cards
in the pc in the car and as a natural part of our everyday lives
  the ecosystem for wireless payments is being established
rapidly this trend is primarily driven by demand for secure and

trends
adaptation to biometrics
users are increasingly becoming accustomed to
the use of biometrics and the number of users
will grow sharply



security and convenience
the need for strong authentication is increasing
in pace with digitalization at the same time
recognized that increased security should not
be a threshold for smooth use as convenience
is equally important



the cloud
storage of data and access to services via the
cloud is impacting the business models in
many operations and increasing the security
demands as more endusers are utilizing cloud
based services



online payments
transactions over the internet are continuing
to increase and are spreading to new users
security becomes a prerequisite to increase the
willingness of using online payment features



digitalization and internet
 more online devices
as online devices requiring logins increase so
does the need for a multitude of pin codes and
passwords

huawei mate 9 pro
the first smartphone launched with fingerprints sensor
under glass the touch sensor in huawei mate pro 9 is placed
on the front and used as the home button covered by glass
as an alternative the sensor can be hidden completely in the
mobiles display glass outside the active screen which allows
fingerprint scanning without a separate button

            everyone is keeping their
            eyes on the ball
            fingerprints algorithm team belongs to one of the four focus
            areas within the rd organization the team develops the
            algorithms and software that optimize image quality perform
            image processing and recognize fingerprints
              the team is led by niels mørch and its members are primarily
            located in copenhagen but also in gothenburg at the end
            of 2016 the team consisted of 40 highly skilled employees
            and consultants about 60 percent of them with phds from
            countries all over the world

            niels what is your view of fingerprints core values
            they are easy to relate to since they are a very good reflection
            of our culture and beliefs

            how would you describe the corporate culture
            our corporate culture is definitely one of our greatest strengths
            our working environment is very collaborative with everyone
            taking responsibility for achieving our common goals everyone
            understands the benefits of sharing information to use a
            soccer metaphor everyone is keeping their eyes on the ball
            not the player thats how you win the game

            how do you view your role as team leader
            leading the organization isnt the job of one person but rather
            a management team my role is to be a facilitator so that
            everyone can do their work

            youre still recruiting  what sort of candidates are you             is it hard to find people like that

            were looking for three things in a candidate first they            applications from all over the world people are
            need to have the theoretical knowledge ideally at phd level         prepared to move here to the nordic region in
            second they need the ability to utilize their scientific skills as   order to work for us they have the skills and the
            engineers and last but not least they need to have the right        decisive element in our recruitment is the attitude
            attitude the ability to look at the big picture and a genuine
            willingness to collaborate
