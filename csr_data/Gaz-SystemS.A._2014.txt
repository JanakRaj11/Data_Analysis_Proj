was the use of ultrasonic clampon flow meters to determine
flow disturbances in measuring systems a scientific study
concerning the optimisation of energy management in

out the study had the form of an energy audit combined
with a prefeasibility study of projects to improve energy
management at the hołowczyce and jarosław compressor
stations the hołowczyce compressor station was further
examined to identify opportunities for energy savings and
operating cost reduction
