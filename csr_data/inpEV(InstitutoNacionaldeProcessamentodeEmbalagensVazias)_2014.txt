the campo limpo system is a successful
program based on the fact that brazil disposes
of 94 of the total packages that the industry
commercializes in guatemala the rate is
67 and in argentina 31 this process is
advancing in all latin american countries at an
average yearly rate of 10 regarding indicators
in other words there is a lot of work ahead for
them to reach the level of the brazilian system
but the trend is improving year after year

the lack of coresponsibility laws involving all
agents of the value chain industrydistribution
producers  different from what happens in
brazil limits the progress but we continue
to be committed to work with authorities and
the industry with the purpose of reaching a
common objective
