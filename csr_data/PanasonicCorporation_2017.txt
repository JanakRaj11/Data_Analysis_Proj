fundamental stance
panasonics founder konosuke matsushita coined numerous aphorisms which are still used at the company hardship
now pleasure later the source of our failures is within us there are signs before all things and small things can
create big problems one must be alert to signs of change and act accordingly among many others using these ideas as
a cornerstone in its thinking the company conducts groupwide risk management activities covering its operations around
the world with the aim of taking preemptive actions to eliminate sources of failurethat is any factors that could impede
the accomplishment of business goals

company believes that by combining these two functions it is better positioned to accomplish its business objectives and
to increase its corporate value furthermore by disclosing appropriate information concerning risks to the public improving
the transparency of its management and reducing risks through preemptive measures the company gives its customers
and other stakeholdersas well as local communities and the public as a wholegreater confidence in its organization

basic framework
panasonic has three levels of management cycles for risk management the gg risk management committee four
panasonic companies and business divisions each year an assessment of the impact of risks that could affect the
business management of companies and affiliated business divisions is undertaken using a single global set of standards
incorporating the potential impact on business operations probability of risk occurring and other factors steps are then
taken to identify major company risks and to ensure that appropriate countermeasures are implemented taking into
consideration these major company risks the gg risk management committee considers and identifies those major
risks that require attention from a groupwide perspective the gg risk management committee also monitors progress
made concerning countermeasures as a means to improve and strengthen groupwide risk management

increasing risk sensitivity
the gg risk management committee systematically educates and raises awareness among panasonic group
employees to ensure the thorough dissemination of knowledge of basic policies on risk management and for these to be
put into practice in addition to disseminating information to all employees through internal communications on its activities
selected corporate major risks and the progress of measures for handling those risks the gg risk management
committee provides annual seminars on risk assessment for managers in charge of risk management promotion the
committee aims to increase the level of skills for the effective conducting of risk assessments by explaining panasonics
basic policy on risk management the risk management guidelines

in addition to prevent risks from becoming even more severe when they have manifested and responses have been
insufficient the committee issues guidelines for business unit directors on responding to risk occurence to the
business unit directors and ensures that these guidelines are put in place thoroughly the committee improves the ability
to handle risks on the ground overseas by providing training on the essentials of risk management how to respond when
risks have manifested and related matters for newly appointed presidents of overseas affiliates and for employees who are
about to be posted overseas

the committee has organized hotlines as a mechanism for employees to report latent risks regarding matters such as
compliance violations various forms of workplace harassment and improprieties in procurement processes employees
and suppliers are able to report any perceived problem independently and at any time the company has also established
a mechanism by which all employees can independently report latent compliancerelated risks in the workplace through
annually conducted compliance awareness surveys feedback concerning reported risks is provided to each workplace
and these risks are dealt with


initiatives relating to business continuity management bcm
as a public entity of society panasonic has established as part of its management philosophy that it will contribute to the
advancement of world culture by working to improve the quality of life of society through the products that it produces and
sells since 2005 the company has been keenly aware of the necessity of activities relating to business continuityone of
the companys duties to society the company thus engages in business continuity management bcm whose goal is to
prevent a halt to the supply of products or the provision of services when contingencies such as disasters have occurred
or in the rare event that service has halted to restart operations as quickly as possible

specifically if disasters or other incidents were to occur within our supply chain they would impact the production or sales
of our group companies in the case of btob this impact would also affect the production and sales of companies to which
we deliver this is why panasonic believes it is critical to have bcm that includes our supply chain

for this reason we have conducted a hazard survey of various risks posed by natural disasters in countries around the
worldearthquakes floods tropical depressions tsunamis naturally occurring fires landslides tornadoes and volcanic
eruptions we have also shared these findings with each of the four companies and have put priorityranked measures
in place both within our own group and in our supply chain we also work hard to obtain information on disasters
and incidents and to respond swiftly in real time both in order to confirm the safety of our employees and to provide
uninterrupted supply to customer companies

forecasts indicate a high probability of a major earthquake in japan directly under the tokyo metropolitan area or in the
nankai trough within the next 30 years in response to these predictions panasonic has established a crosscompany
task force which is promoting earthquake resistance and disaster responses based on the latest government damage
predictions the task force conducts annual groupwide disasterpreparedness training drills it has established emergency
response headquarters at every level of the group within the four companies and within business divisions these
headquarters are intended to maintain and improve panasonics initial response capabilitiesincluding confirmation of the
safety of employees and reporting among different emergency response headquarters on the degree of damage

in terms of procurement activities we also manage the securing of replacement sourcing and the building up of inventory
for emergencies based on evaluations of the criticality and interchangeability of procured parts

concerning fires the task force conducts periodic fire risk assessments independent fire prevention checks and fire
prevention audits and strives to prevent similar accidents from occurring again by sharing case studies of dealing with fire
related accidents

                                                                            10

environment panasonic environment vision 2050

panasonic environment vision 2050
the management philosophy of panasonic is based on the belief of our founder konosuke matsushita who said since a
company runs its business by borrowing people things money land and so forth from the society a company is a public
entity of society he also said that the role of a company which is a public entity of society is to contribute to the society
and therefore if the companys activities destroy nature and take away peoples happiness it would be like putting the cart
before the horse

panasonic currently focuses on four business areas consumer electronics housing automotive and b2b under the brand
slogan a better life a better world a better world means to face various social challenges including environment
energy and safety aiming to contribute to realizing a sustainable society by resolving such challenges

to date panasonic has executed the environmental action plan green plan 2018 see pages 1417 and has shown
steady progress to achieve its targets meanwhile with environmental andor energy issues becoming more serious at a
global level the concern for such issues is increasingly growing in the international society as can be proven by the paris
agreement or sdgs sustainable development goals by the united nations

under these circumstances we wish to help build a society with clean energy to realize both a better life and a
sustainable society by making full use of our technologies in all of our business areas the reasons why we focus on clean
energy are because 1 use of clean energy is developing at a global level 2 this is an area where panasonic can greatly
contribute to with its businesses and 3 many of our products consume power over a long period and our businesses
create the most environmental impact in this area

with such background in 2017 panasonic formulated the panasonic environment vision 2050 environment vision
2050 as a longterm vision for environmentally sustainable management



                                               panasonic environment vision 2050



                                   to achieve a better life and a sustainable global environment

                                                       panasonic will work towards
                                        creation and more efficient utilization of energy
                                           which exceeds the amount of energy used
                                 aiming for a society with clean energy and a more comfortable lifestyle




                                     energy used  energy created


the environment vision 2050 means to work towards creation and more efficient utilization of energy which exceeds the
amount of energy used aiming for a society with clean energy and a more comfortable lifestyle

currently relative to the amount of energy used energy used in our business activities such as during production and
energy used by products in the hands of our customers the amount of energy created clean energy that is created
andor made available by products and services by panasonic such as photovoltaic power generation systems storage
batteries and energy solutions is merely onetenth from now on for the energy used we will develop technologies for
improving energysaving performances of products and innovate manufacturing processes to reduce the amount of energy
consumption for the energy created we will expand energycreation and storage businesses as well as contribute to new
social systems such as a hydrogen society to increase the amount of clean energy

through these efforts panasonic will endeavor to make the energy created exceed the energy used toward the year 2050

                                                                             11

activities for achieving the environment vision 2050
one of the initiatives to realize the environment vision 2050 is creating a safe and secure society with clean energy to be
specific we will work to provide ecoconscious and smart living spaces as well as contribute to ecoconscious and smart
travel and transport

another initiative is promoting businesses aiming for a sustainable society we will work to promote effective utilization of
resources as well as promote the creation of factories with zero co2 emissions

1 panasonic will create a safe and secure society with clean energy
the ecoconscious and smart living spaces that panasonic strives to provide means living spaces that create clean energy
from electricity andor hydrogen and then storingtransporting the created energy such living spaces offer a safe and
secure life with clean energy enabled through appropriate energy management for energysaving equipment and buildings
with high insulation performances here living spaces refer to not only homes of individuals but also working or learning
spaces and spaces for living or leisure it refers to all spaces relating to peoples lives

in order to realize this panasonic will work on development of environmental technologies from the four viewpoints of
energy creation energy saving energy storage and energy management

as for energy creation in particular we will develop fuel cell technologies that use nextgeneration solar cells or hydrogen
derived from clean energy as energy sources at the same time for energy storage we will work on technologies relating
to storing andor supplying hydrogen and storage batteries these will expand the possibilities of utilizing clean energy
anywhere in the society

we will also work on developing environmental technologies to realize ecoconscious and smart travel and transport with
further development in technology of storage battery systems for ecocars such as electric vehicles we will contribute
to promoting the shift from fossil fuels to clean energy additionally for a safe mobility society we will work on further
development of support systems for autonomous driving and utilize our iot technology etc to realize nextgeneration
logisticstransport solutions that help arteries in the society flow more smoothly

2 panasonic will promote businesses aiming for a sustainable society
as efforts to promote effective utilization of resources panasonic will aim for sustainable use of resources through the
reuse of parts and materials and product recycling

to create factories with zero co2 emissions we are switching the lighting to led and plan to complete this transition
by the end of fiscal 20191 we will also expand the utilization of advanced energymanagement systems such as fems2
and smart manufacturing in addition we will complete the adoption of photovoltaic power generation systems in all our
business sites by 20201 as an initiative to increase energy creation

on this the green plan 2018 was revised in 2013 followed by the newlyestablished environmental action guideline
furthermore in response to rising demand by the society for co2 reductions following the 21st session of the conference
of the parties cop21 of the united nations conference on climate change and to the need to make changes to our
business structure including growth in the automotive and b2b businesses the plan was revised again in 2016

additionally we formulated the environment vision 2050 in 2017 to achieve a better life and a sustainable global
environment aiming for a society with clean energy and a more comfortable lifestyle under the vision through the
development of products technologies and solutions relating to energy creation storage saving and management
panasonic will work towards creation and more efficient utilization of energy which exceeds the amount of energy used

          we will expand our environmental contributions with our partner companies
          we will deepen communications with local communities and work as a team to address environmental challenges




                                                        environmental action plan



we strive to grow and develop our business through the creation of environmental value for customers with our technical
strengths while each and every employee follows the environmental policy to address environmental challenges therefore
collaboration with stakeholders including our partners is essential we will continue to sincerely work on environmental
sustainability management through further collaboration with stakeholders


environmental action plan green plan 2018
the green plan 2018 is focused on maximizing the size of our contribution in reducing co2 emissions through products
and services see pages 3334 which is an indicator that represents our efforts for co2 reduction as well as on steady
and continual reduction in co2 emissions from our factories to contribute to making net co2 emissions from the entire
community peak and decline thereafter at an earlier timing

panasonic has introduced its own indicator called the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions to strengthen co2
reduction efforts through products and services the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions had been disclosed
from the fiscal 2011 results to represent the volume of our direct contribution to co2 emissions reduction by cutting down
power consumption during product use through energysaving designs for our key consumer products now we are also
engaged in business development in the areas of housing automotive and b2b accordingly more of our products are
being integrated into finished goods and services of other companies contributing to their energysaving performances
for this reason we have defined the co2 emissions reduction effect in these business areas as the size of indirect
contribution to reduction and disclosed the figures from the fiscal 2015 results in addition the revised green plan 2018
clearly stated the target amount of co2 reduction to clarify our contribution in these areas

furthermore we define our products and services that accelerate the transition to a sustainable society such as energy
saving performances as strategic green products gps of these we call the products that deliver the industrys top class

                                                                            14

environmental performance super gps and are actively working for business expansion and wider use

in production activities exhaustive energysaving measures have been implemented in all factories worldwide pushing
for further co2 emissions reduction in our production activities as for resources recycling we promote higher recycled
resource utilization ratio and factory waste recycling rate as well as create more resources recyclingoriented products to
materialize recyclingoriented manufacturing

in addition the revised green plan 2018 has set new targets such as 100 completion of water risk assessments for our
factories it also clearly states zero violation of laws and regulations related to environmental pollution by factories and
products

in the area of ecoconscious products and businesses we have expanded the scope of our activities to products services
and solutions in our b2b business while applying our strengths in home appliances the concrete numerical targets
established in line with the revisions to the green plan 2018 are aimed at creating environmental value for our customers
panasonic will deepen the collaboration with various partners across the supply chain and accelerate environmental
initiatives to extend better impacts on the society

we will steadily execute this environmental action plan towards achieving our fiscal 2019 targets

climate change resources water etc

panasonic group formulates its annual environmental management policy in accordance with the group management
policy the environment vision 2050 environmental action guideline and the environmental action plan green plan
2018 the annual environmental policy is shared across the entire organization through the operation policy meeting led
by the executive officer in charge of environmental affairs who has the authority delegated from the president companies
business divisions and regional headquarters outside japan establish their own environmental policies and targets based
on this group policy and plan and promote their activities accordingly

annual performance data is given internally and disclosed externally after review onsite audits and independent assurance
by a thirdparty moreover reviews and feedback from stakeholders are utilized in subsequent measures to ensure further

environment environmental risk management

groupwide systems to manage environmental risks
as a tool to continuously reduce environmental risks panasonic has established an environmental risk management
system specific to each company in accordance with the basic risk management policy for all companies see page 8
we promote 1 identification of environmental risks and groupwide risk management each year and 2 ensuring quick
responses to reported environmental risks

to identify environmental risks and implement the management system environmental risks are identified for each
company and for each region in the world each year from these risks environmental risks on a groupwide level are
selected the risks that show a high level of frequency or seriously impact business management are designated as major
risks and prioritized in planning and executing riskreducing measures these measures are implemented for each major
risk and progress is monitored and followed up on a quarterly basis in the pdca cycle

when an environmental risk is found the relevant company related job functions and regional headquarters collaborate
to promptly implement emergency measures and recurrence prevention measures adapted to the risk level also the
management flow in case of risk discovery is standardized to prevent the occurrence of secondary risks as a result of
confusion

assessment at the design completion stage and 4 conduct final assessment at the mass production decisionmaking
stage additionally acceptance inspections are being conducted on a regular basis for purchased components to ensure
compliance with the rohs regulations which regulates the content of six hazardous substances see page 61 chemical
substances management

notwithstanding there was one violation of regulations relating to chemical substance management in fiscal 2017
going forward we will conduct reviews at a stricter level for potential presence of regulated substances and strengthen
compliance management


measures against soil and groundwater contamination
in the latter half of the 1980s soil and groundwater contamination due to chlorinated organic solvents was detected at
some panasonic sites in response we have conducted anticontamination activities across the company specifically
in 1991 we created the manual for preventing contamination of soil and groundwater and began conducting necessary
surveys and measures in 1995 we discontinued the use of chlorinated organic solvents and in 1999 created guidelines
on the prevention of environmental pollution to ensure there would be no recurrence of similar problems at our sites in
fiscal 2003 we began enhancing our surveys and measures to comply with relevant laws and regulations including the
soil contamination countermeasures act which was enforced in japan in 2003 and in fiscal 2004 started implementing
measures to place all our bases across the globe under management supervision with regard to soil and groundwater

specifically we conduct onsite inspections and interviews at the bases in addition to surveying their use of vocs and
heavy metals furthermore we implement surface soil surveys within the premises for the sites where contamination was
detected beyond the regulatory pollution standards we conduct detailed borehole surveys to identify the boundaries of the
contaminated areas and take remedial measures

as a result of these efforts we were able to place all our bases under management supervision in 2008 furthermore in
fiscal 2011 the management supervision scheme was purposespecifically reorganized and reinforced to establish a new
management supervision scheme with the highest priority given to preventing dispersion of pollution beyond our premises
this new scheme is implemented across all operating sites to further improve the level of measures against contamination
in fiscal 2017 we reviewed the new management supervision guidelines in response to the amended soil contamination
countermeasures act in japan

to adapt to the wide range of products including automotive
equipment in step with the expansion of our businesses as
well as to comply with laws and regulations that have grown in complexity in coordination with product design databases

also we aim to cut down co2 emissions during product use by improving the energysaving performance of our products
for this reason the eco system product is used to globally assess the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions by
linking product performance data such as annual power consumption for each product category with other data such as
sales volume and co2 emission factors in each region

environment ecoconscious products and factories

initiatives for ecoconscious products green products
panasonic uses a product assessment system that evaluates the environmental impacts of our products and services
starting at the planning and design stages based on our criteria we accredit our products and services that achieved high
environmental performance as green products gps

in the gp accreditation criteria we assess the performance of our products in terms of prevention of global warming
effective utilization of resources and management of chemical substances by comparing not only among our own products
but also with competitors products in fiscal 2012 we took steps to further enhance our accreditation criteria by adding
biodiversity and water conservation to existing items this has in turn enabled the creation of a wider range of gps

starting in fiscal 2014 the existing superior gps1 have been enhanced to designate products and services that accelerate
the transition to a sustainable society as strategic gps of these products products that particularly create new consumer
trends are certified as super gps

2 life cycle assessment method of quantitatively assessing the environmental impact of products at each life cycle stage



expanding the scope of strategic gps
panasonic has been devoting much of its energies into the creation of no 1 ecoconscious products superior gps until
fiscal 2013 in the course of business reorganizations such as expansion of b2b businesses panasonic has decided not
only to pursue environmental performance of consumer products but also to work on further expansion of products and
services that lead to the mitigation of environmental impact starting in fiscal 2014 the concept of strategic gps has been
introduced for the creation of such products and services in addition to alleviating impact on the global environment with
toplevel environmental performance we aim to accelerate the drive to shift to a sustainable society through a variety of
business operations including those that are expected to reduce impacts through wider dissemination and those directly
cutting impact in specified regions

the ratio of strategic gps rose from approx 21 in fiscal 2016 to 23 in fiscal 2017 additionally in our green plan 2018
we have set the fiscal 2019 target as 120 of expansion of sales in ecoconscious b2b strategic gps compared with
fiscal 2016 the result of fiscal 2017 was 103 compared to fiscal 2015 panasonic will work to further push up the ratio
of strategic gps in the future

initiatives for ecoconscious factories green factories
panasonic is working on green factories gf activities in its efforts to cut down environmental impact caused by
manufacturing specifically based on legal compliance each factory develops a variety of plans for reducing environmental
impact in production activities focusing on co2 emissions total waste generation water consumption and chemical
substance releases and transfers progress control is implemented and improved through total emissions reduction and
specific unit management to achieve both environmental impact reduction and business management

the gf assessment system was introduced in fiscal 2011 aiming for further advancement by visualizing the activity levels
at factories under the system the factories evaluate themselves on a onetofive scale across 19 environmental activity
items classified into six basic groups emissions reduction environmental performance enhancement reduction activities
risk reduction human resource development and management comparing the progress with other sites and implementing
relative assessment enables the factory to identify issues and voluntarily reviewpromote measures for improvement in
fiscal 2014 the system was upgraded to enable the addition of further assessment items to the existing 19 based on the
companys needs for example at companies where additional items have been introduced in the area of compliance
with environmental regulations and management methods assessment questions such as whether voluntary standards on

air and water quality of the facilitiesair conditioners have been set at a level higher than what is required by law have been
included to strengthen risk management at respective factories

additionally information on global activities for environmental impact reduction legislation and social trends are shared
through the manufacturing environmental information sharing group in europe southeast asia china and latin
america where our factories are located regional information exchanges and competitions on best practices to reduce
environmental impact presentation of awards for best practices and activities for groupwide expansion are held as
needed we are promoting gf activities suited to the issues of each region to boost and accelerate efforts and actions

furthermore the best practices regarding co2 emissions waste chemical substances water etc at respective factories
are registered and shared in the beforeafter ba chart search system accessible on a global scale to enable utilization
in other factories in fiscal 2017 a large number of past cases that have accumulated were reviewed in detail at the same
time the system was improved to enable easier access to appropriate practices and case studies by adding items such
as reduction volumes economic benefits and number of years required for investment recovery and we are working to
widely promote management knowhow etc across the group

in order to support these gf activities respective regional headquarters companies and related divisions in each region
are working on human resource development programs every year in their respective regions training programs are
being organized including those on energy conservation management of chemical substances and waste management
which are in great demand in china and southeast asia where panasonic has many sites special training programs on
environmental laws and regulations are being held especially in china to ensure compliance with the legislation being
strengthened at great speed

environment co2 reduction

size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions
the paris agreement that went into effect in november 2016 sets out a target to limit global temperature increases to less
than 2c above preindustrial levels and a more ambitious target to keep global temperature increases to less than 15c
above preindustrial levels as well as sets the goal for co2 and other greenhouse gas emission levels for the second half
of this century to be virtually zero to achieve these targets it is essential to cut co2 emissions to the greatest extent
possible and companies are required to make further contributions to reducing co2 emissions

panasonic has introduced a unique indicator size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions to accelerate emissions
reduction targeting our products for energy saving and energy creation the size of contribution in reducing co2
emissions is defined as the amount achieved by deducting the actual emissions from the amount that would have been
emitted without the improvements by the energysaving performance of our products and productivity from fiscal 2006
and this amount is combined with the emission reduction resulting from power generation by energycreating products
in other words it reflects the continuous efforts being made to reduce co2 emissions

panasonic will continue to maximize the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions

we will improve the energysaving performance of our products to reduce the energy consumed in using the products
the more energysaving products are introduced and promoted the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions will
further increase

meanwhile since fiscal 2014 panasonic has been reinforcing its housing automotive and b2b businesses and is
disclosing the co2 reduction effect results in these areas from fiscal 2015 specifically the data represents air conditioning
load reduction effects from improved insulation performance in panasonic housing energysaving effects from products
by other companies equipped with panasonic energysaving compressors and motors and improved fuel economy
effects from electric vehicles equipped with panasonic automotive batteries starting with the results for fiscal 2016 the
energysaving effect of products by other manufacturers using panasonic vacuum insulation materials is calculated and
disclosed from the results for fiscal 2017 co2 reduction effects as a result of energy saving such as less travelling made
possible through the use of hd visual communication systems are also calculated and disclosed

we regard such contribution in reducing co2 emissions as indirect contribution to reducing co2 emissions to distinguish
them from the direct contribution from products under the panasonic brand such as home appliances this indicates that
panasonic products support the co2 reduction effects for products by other manufacturers

our size contribution in reducing co2 emissions through products and services amounted to 5269 million tons in fiscal
2017 of this direct contributions amounted to 3958 million tons and indirect contributions to 1311 million tons

      the 2c limit cannot be achieved unless dramatic cuts are made to co2 emissions immediately
      it is possible to keep to the 2c limit if reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are started in 2015 but a 5year
       delay in commencement is expected to cause the temperature to rise by 25c a 10year delay is predicted to
       cause the temperature to rise by over 3c far exceeding the 2c limit
      even if emission reductions were implemented right away actual reductions must be achieved at a great speed
       that would accomplish carbon positive by 2080

     it is imperative to reduce as must as possible the amount of energy consumed during the use of electrical appliances
     designed to be used for a long period this is all the more essential in view of the fact that we cannot rely on nuclear
     power panasonic has supplied energysaving products and energycreating products to the market at an early
     stage thereby contributing to reducing co2 emissions in the entire society panasonics size of contribution in
     reducing co2 emissions in fiscal 2017 was 5269 million tons which is equivalent to roughly 4 of the total amount
     of emissions in japanthis is a significantly major effect the steady increase in the size of contribution since fiscal
     2011 demonstrates the companys continuing efforts for innovation in its environmental activities

     panasonics efforts to mitigate climate change are indeed diverse covering not only its endproducts but also
     its supply of intermediate products and business solutions with high energy efficiency in addition its active
     implementation of measures to adapt to climate change including the 100000 solar lanterns project10 and the
     coastal monitoring system11 is worth recognition i look forward to panasonics continued execution of powerful
     initiatives as a leading global company working to address climate change from all directions


10 panasonic is promoting a corporate citizenship activity of donating 100000 solar lanterns to communities without electricity in asia and africa by
    2018 the 100th anniversary of its founding we contribute to resolve various social issues of the people living in communities without electricity

energysaving products
the size of direct contribution in reducing co2 emissions through our energysaving products in fiscal 2017 was 3570
million tons due to steady sales of home appliances and led lighting particularly in japan in the breakdown of the size of
contribution in reducing co2 emissions by global product category 73 was from air conditioners lighting equipment and
tvs by region japan southeast asia  oceania china  northeast asia made up approx 81 co2 emissions from the
use of our major products2 in fiscal 2017 is estimated to be approx 6350 million tons1 we will continue to further reduce
the co2 emissions from the use of major products by making energysaving products even more widely available

also improvement in energy efficiency of major consumer electronics by 35 compared to the fiscal 2006 level is our
numerical target for fiscal 2019 under our green plan 2018 the results for fiscal 2017 marked 41 due to an increase in
sales of high energysaving performance models the green plan 2018 also includes a numerical target for fiscal 2019 to
achieve a 75 sales ratio for led lighting residential and nonresidential buildings and the fiscal 2017 results marked 73

energycreating products
we actively develop our energy creation business to maximize the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions by
delivering photovoltaic power generation systems and household fuel cell cogeneration systems as means to create
necessary electricity with few co2 emissions we reduce co2 emissions in society

the size of direct contribution in reducing co2 emissions through energycreating products in fiscal 2017 was 388
million tons due to the stagnant solar market for housing in japan by region japan accounts for approx 80

other fiscal 2019 targets under the green plan 2018 include achieving 440000 mwh of total power generation from
dissemination of household fuel cells fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2019 and 5 million mwh of total power generation from
dissemination of photovoltaic power generation systems fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2019 the results of total power generation
up to fiscal 2017 were 299000 mwh from household fuel cells and 378 million mwh from photovoltaic power generation
systems

initiatives for energystoring products
energystoring products such as lithiumion batteries can be used in various situations for electric power storage and
contribute to co2 reduction through installation in offices homes etc in addition our automotive lithiumion batteries
are one of the key devices that help promote the popularization of ecoconscious cars panasonic is actively engaged in
the development of energystoring products

under our green plan 2018 we have set the target as 200 for battery supply demand for increase in automotive battery
supply compared to the fiscal 2015 level the results up to fiscal 2017 were 125

environment global warming mitigation and adaptation

global warming mitigation
while people seek for affluent lifestyles the acceleration of global warming caused by the increase in co2 emissions
from peoples daily lives and corporate activities is becoming a concern panasonic promotes measures to mitigate the
progress of climate change and to minimize the impact by reducing the greenhouse gases emitted from its products and
services as well as production activities

as measures to mitigate the impact of our products and services we offer energymanagement products and solutions
that link and control a range of energysavingcreatingstoring products

in promoting our netzero energy house zeh we defined a numerical target for the zeh ratio for all detached houses
under green plan 2018 however the promotion did not progress as planned with a slump in the rate of installation of
photovoltaic power generation systems essential for zeh as a result of the decline in the surplus energy purchase price
the figure for fiscal 2017 was 17 compared to our initial fiscal 2019 target of 68 this has led us to redefine the zeh
ratio targets to 17 for fiscal 2018 22 for fiscal 2019 and 50 for fiscal 2021 to achieve these targets we plan to
accelerate the dissemination of zeh by making effective use of government policies and by providing a comprehensive
proposal for ecoconscious and smart living spaces

in addition to these energy management solutions in the housing area the panasonic group is also promoting smart
town projects in fujisawa city and yokohama city in kanagawa prefecture under green plan 2018 we are aiming to
start constructionsales at three locations 870 lots from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2019 the results up to fiscal 2017
were three locations 424 lots

more details on reducing co2 emissions at our factories can be found on pages 4043 for details on reducing co2
emissions in logistics see pages 4446
examples of solutions for global warming mitigation are also introduced on the following website

global warming adaptation
panasonic is also making efforts for adaptation to address unavoidable impacts on the
global environment that cannot be addressed by mitigation measures such adaptation
is based on the matters indicated by the intergovernmental panel on climate change
ipcc etc focusing on the impact of climate change on the ecosystem society and the
economy further we understand that it is important for the measures to take account of
regional characteristics as impacts of climate change vary according to the region

our measures are currently implemented from the viewpoints of the following two aspects
                                                                                                                            coastal tsunami monitoring

environment global warming prevention at factories

reducing co2 emissions through production activities
panasonic is working to reduce co2 emissions in factories with the aim of contributing to climate change mitigation as well
as improving production efficiency in factories and reducing energy costs

since fiscal 2011 we have been using our unique indicator the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions to improve
our energy management capabilities and reduce the co2 emissions per basic unit working to maximize the size of
contribution in reducing co2 emissions in production activities in revising green plan 2018 our environmental action plan
we changed the indicator for co2 reductions in our production activities to co2 basic unit with the target for fiscal 2019
to exceed the fiscal 2014 level by at least 5

in addition to individual efforts implemented in each factory energysaving and co2 emission reduction measures including
horizontal introduction of good examples across the company specialist training and co2 itakona initiatives1 are
promoted we are also promoting the introduction of photovoltaic power generation to achieve our fiscal 2019 target of at
least 10000 mwh of inhouse renewable energy adoption our investment in co2 emissions reduction in fiscal 2017 was 28
billion yen2

as a result the co2 basic unit in fiscal 2017 reduced by 8 compared to fiscal 2014 not only the basic unit but also the
total amount of energy consumption is reducing steadily

furthermore we are shifting the lighting to led at our factories offices showrooms and other buildings we plan to
complete this transition on a global scale by the end of fiscal 20193

panasonic is a member of keidanrens commitment to a low carbon society a voluntary action program for global
warming prevention across the entire electric and electronic industry with the targets set aiming at 2030 specifically we
are steadily implementing energysaving measures in factories and offices in order to achieve the goals set by the industry
in japan aiming improvement in energy consumption rate in factories and large offices at an annual rate of 1 on average
towards 2030
1 itakona is a term unique to panasonic which refers to a process by which we review stages prior to production to study raw materials to
  ensure waste is minimized and quality is maintained we apply a similar review process for our co2 emissions reduction efforts and call these our
  co2 itakona initiatives the activity is aimed at discovering energy conservation measures from a new viewpoint through continuous display of
  energy consumption levels energy consumption per basic unit and analyzing the factors that influence the variables in each basic unit

4 calculated using the weighted average of improvement rates compared to the fiscal 2014 in co2 emissions per basic unit which is calculated
  by dividing co2 emissions by the volume of activity closely related to co2 emissions including production amounts and volumes etc of each
  factory basic unit of fiscal 2014 was converted into an index as 100
5 the factors related to fuels are based on the guidelines for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions version 22 published by the japanese
  ministry of the environment the co2 emission factor kgco2kwh for electricity purchased in japan in each fiscal year is fixed at 0410 to
  accurately reflect efforts for co2 emissions reduction if the factors set for each fiscal year are used instead 0570 for fiscal 2014 0554 for fiscal
  2015 2016 and 2017 total co2 emissions will be 319 million tons for fiscal 2014 277 million tons for fiscal 2015 261 million tons for fiscal
  2016 and 258 million tons for fiscal 2017 the factors above are also used for electricity purchased from power producers and suppliers pps

promoting co2 reduction activities in our factories
to ensure the reduction of co2 emissions at our factories                                concept of the co2 itakona initiative
it is important to track the energy consumption of each

                                                                                                                                            under study to minimize energy
measures to visualize reduction effects to date we have                                                                                   consumption per basic unit

introduced more than 40000 measurement systems and
factory energy management systems fems at all of
our global manufacturing sites and we have continued to
promote our co2 metageji 6 initiative

based on this scheme the co2 itakona initiative has
been implemented since fiscal 2011 the activity is aimed                                                                               minimum energy consumption per basic unit
at discovering energy conservation measures from a
new viewpoint through continuous display of energy                                                                                                                                 time
consumption per basic unit of production and analyzing
the factors that influence the variables in each basic unit

in order to accelerate action under the co2 itakona initiative we developed the senavi software that displays energy
and production data simultaneously and analyze energy consumption per basic unit the energysaving navigation
function of this software quantitatively extracts energy loss per device as well as loss per factor based on the automatic
energy loss analysis results through co2 itakona analysis with this function energysaving efforts prioritizing processes
with large energy loss have been made easier

conventionally energy consumption and other data had been analyzed manually by specialists in order to develop energy
conservation measures this function automatically analyzes data and enables users to consider energy conservation
measures based on the energysaving measure database not only did this contribute to a reduction in working time but
also to the identification of energysaving measures without the assistance of specialists

to continuously study mechanisms for co2 reduction the factory co2 reduction working group was set up in fiscal
2017 as a corporatewide program one of the working groups activities is the exhaustive use of measuring instruments
and fems previously introduced to bring greater results of co2 reduction in model plants measurement of physical
data of main processes such as temperature humidity and differential pressure was added to enable multifaceted data
analysis and to bring further depth to our energy saving efforts

at panasonic energy wuxi co ltd in china attention was focused on heat source facilities with much exhaust gas
and work data including heat volume flow rate as well as points for quality control including dew point were visualized
in addition to energy data measurement the introduction of a standby mode which enables reduction of emissions
while keeping the internal temperature of furnace from dropping when not in
production and automatic switching to standby mode when temporarily not in
production has led to an annual co2 reduction of 115 tons

at automotive  industrial systems companys uji factory in kyoto
temperature humidity and differential pressure in and outside the
manufacturing processes were incorporated into existing fems for data
analysis this led to the discovery of a production floor with excessive intake of
external air an annual co2 reduction of 80 tons was achieved by discontinuing
this external air intake and changing to internal air circulation                                         factory co2 reduction working group



utilization of renewable energy
in order to reduce co2 emissions panasonic actively and globally promotes the
adoption of renewable energy suitable to the characteristics of the region such
as photovoltaic power generation

an example of a largescale implementation in fiscal 2017 is the 10 mw
photovoltaic power generation system installed at our factory in singapore that
supplies roughly 20 of its electric power demand at its peak in europe where
wind power generation is more advanced a 20 mw wind power generation
system has been introduced at our factory in belgium supplying roughly                                    photovoltaic power generation system in
                                                                                                           singapore
25 of its peak electric power demand in addition wood scraps and wood
dust generated in the manufacturing process and wooden pallets used for
distribution are being used for biomass power generation in gunma prefecture
and in the uk respectively

as a result of such efforts our inhouse renewable energy adoption across the
entire company7 reached 12000 mwh8 in fiscal 2017 and we have achieved
our target under the green plan 2018 our environmental action plan revised in
fiscal 2017 which was to reach 10000 mwh in the use of inhouse renewable
energy by fiscal 2019                                                                                     wind power generation system in belgium

adoption of photovoltaic power generation systems is also underway at respective
sites on a global scale in addition to those mentioned above and we aim for
completion at all sites considered feasible for adoption by the end of fiscal 2021
we will continue our efforts to achieve further reductions in co2 emissions

environment green logistics

reducing co2 emissions in logistics
to contribute to the prevention of global warming as well as to improve transportation efficiency while reducing costs
panasonic is working to reduce co2 emissions in logistics when we revised green plan 2018 our environmental action
plan in 2016 we set the targets of reducing co2 emissions per basic unit1 by at least 1 yearonyear and by 5 from the
fiscal 2014 level by fiscal 2019 focusing on modal shift introduction of lowemission vehicles and biodiesel fuel reduction in
transportation distances and improvement in load factor

in fiscal 2017 our global co2 emissions from logistics activities came to 082 million tons across the world of which
international transportation was 033 million tons 41 and domestic transportation within japan was 0133 million tons
16 co2 emissions per basic unit of transportation within japan reduced by 58 from the fiscal 2014 level
1 co2 emissions per transportation weight

modal shift2 initiative in collaboration with logistics partners
panasonic promotes modal shift in transportation from trucks to railroad in order to reduce co2 emissions

since fiscal 2016 panasonic has taken the initiative in modal shift collaborating with our logistics partners including
mitsuisoko logistics co ltd japan freight railway company and nippon express co ltd

conventionally we delivered cold chain equipment from gunma prefecture to
fukuoka prefecture by truck based on requests from customers in 2015 we
established the kyushu stock point sp to achieve stable product supply and
optimize stocks of popular products this enabled us to shift the means of
delivery from road to railway the co2 emissions reduction effects from this shift
are equivalent to 304 tons per year 113 compared to the previous year

as a result our railway transportation in japan in fiscal 2017 reached 9770 five
ton containers reducing 4968 tons of co2 emissions
                                                                                                            rail freight transportation
2 switch from truck and air transport to railroad and sea vessel transport that has less
  environmental impact



adoption of new natural gas heavyduty trucks
from february 2017 we started using a new type of heavyduty trucks that utilize natural gas3 for product deliveries
between osaka and tokyo this is the first heavy truck to be introduced under the project to accelerate usage of advanced
ecofriendly trucks and buses which commenced in fiscal 2017 led by the ministry of the environment in collaboration with
the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism and the ministry of economy trade and industry

panasonic participated in japans first longdistance trial of naturalgas heavyduty trucks in fiscal 2010 since then we
have been taking part in field tests and promotional activities by public and private sectors towards practical utilization of
naturalgas heavyduty trucks the truck adopted at this time can reduce
co2 emissions by more than 10 compared with diesel trucks in the same
classification that conform with the fiscal 2016 fuel economy standards
on february 27 2017 the first day of truck operation the operator of the
truckeco truck co ltd kadoma city osaka prefectureheld a launch
ceremony sponsored by the kinki smart ecologi council4

in addition to adopting natural gas trucks we will continue to promote a
range of efforts to reduce environmental impact such as by further modal
shifts as well as reducing waste from logistic materials

use of biodiesel fuel japan
panasonic promotes transforming waste cooking oil collected from its business sites into biodiesel fuel and utilizing it for
vehicles used in production procurement and marketing activities since fiscal 2010 we have been using 100 biodiesel
fuel for the joint transportation with the asahi shimbun company in the tokai and tokyo metropolitan areas to enhance
further usage of biodiesel fuel

however due to the decrease in vehicles compatible with biofuel and also because of vehicles that shifted to diesel as a
result of discontinuation of production by biofuel suppliers usage of biofuel in fiscal 2017 fell to 29632 liters 49 of the
previous year

recycling of stretching film used in transportation
as an effort to reduce logistics waste we jointly                                stretch film recycling scheme with nozoe
entered into a full recycling scheme for used stretch
film with nozoe industry inc nozoe in fiscal 2015
                                                                                                   nozoe collects used stretch film
and are continuing the initiative in fiscal 2017 the
stretch film used for our transport was previously
discarded but is now recycled by nozoe as a material
for plastic garbage bags which we then purchase
                                                                                     nozoe                                      panasonic
a total of 182 tons of stretching film was recycled
in fiscal 2017 117 compared to fiscal 2016 as a                                                purchases garbage bags etc

result of expanding our initiatives from sites centered
in the kansai area to the kanto area which was made
possible through the opening of a new recycling factory
in saitama prefecture by nozoe we plan to further
                                                                                                  purchases stretch film and
expand this scheme to the north kanto and chubu                                                    uses it for transportation
areas in fiscal 2018 we will continue to make effective
use of used stretch film and reduce logistics waste


landing shipments at a port close to the target sales area
aiming for higher efficiency in transporting products panasonic is expanding its our efforts to land imported products at
a port close to the target sales area in japan conventionally landing of products was centralized to a port near the west
japan global logistics center glc in amagasaki city in hyogo prefecture stored at the west japan glc and then
transported to respective locations as required landing the products at ports closer to the target sales areas can reduce
the distance required for land transport within japan thereby contributing to reducing not only co2 emissions but also
inbound and outbound deliveries between sites as well as distribution costs this effort has reduced co2 emissions by 1107
tons per year

we will further refine projection of sales demand in various regions and optimize stock amounts held in those areas and
expand landing products at ports near target sales areas

environment resources recycling

recyclingoriented manufacturing
with swift economic growth advancing worldwide and bringing heightened attention to concerns over resources the
sourcing of new resources and materials not only significantly impact the environment but mineral resource depletion and
material pricing runup have also become issues

to address these concerns and as a responsibility of a manufacturer that uses a large volume of resources panasonic
has been propelling recyclingoriented manufacturing under the theme of recycling resources since 2010 placing it as an
important issue along with co2 emissions reduction under the green plan 2018 which was revised in 2016 increase in
the usage amount of recycled resin and higher factory waste recycling rates continue to be promoted and realization of
recyclingoriented manufacturing is being further implemented through efforts such as expanding the creation of recycling
oriented products recycled resin in particular is being promoted with a target figure to ensure increase in usage

recyclingoriented manufacturing has three aspects under this concept which are to minimize the amount of total
resources used and maximize the amount of recycled resources aim towards zero waste emissions by reducing our
landfill disposal of waste from production activities and recycle used products

we have been working on the weight reduction and downsizing of products to minimize the total resources used and are
continuing to increase resource collection through introduction of new recycling technologies and systems to expand the
usage of recycled resources

furthermore by reducing the amount of factory waste and thoroughly recycling resources from waste we are working to
eliminate the amount of waste treated in landfills to as close to zero

in addition to utilizing the resources that were previously wasted across the entire production process we have established
a process where resources are recovered from used products recycled into products and further delivered to customers
to realize sustainable business activities throughout the product life cycle

we use many kinds of resources including iron 27 of total resources used and plastic 10 of total resources used
due to our wide range of products and businesses from home appliances components such as semiconductors and
batteries to housing in recyclingoriented manufacturing it is important to promote the reduction of total resources used
and at the same time develop a recycling process according to the specific characteristics of each resource for expansion
of our usage of recycled resources

furthermore we clarify recycled resource utilization issues by identifying the volume of each type of resource used across
the panasonic group for example in the case of recycled resin we used approx 15900 tons of recycled resin in our
products in fiscal 2017 by identifying the characteristics required in the materials to be used securing a stable supply
researching how to recycle it in production and developing new recycling technologies total usage of recycled resin since
fiscal 2015 has reached approx 50600 tons although we have achieved the target under the green plan 2018 we will
continue to work on further reducing total resources used and maximizing utilization of recycled resources to maintain and
improve our recycled resource utilization ratio

in addition as for the recycling rate of waste at factories we had traditionally set different targets for japan and countries
outside japan according to the relevant local infrastructures however with the awareness of the importance of zero
waste emission activities we have set a globally standardized target since fiscal 2011 and are taking steps to improve the
standard level of waste recycling across the entire group the factory waste recycling rate1 was 990 for fiscal 2017
against the target of 99 or more in fiscal 2019 see page 57

environment reduction in resources used

reducing product mass
to minimize the use of resources for production we continuously look to reduce the weight of our products through
the product environmental assessment see page 29 panasonic has been promoting resource saving from the product
planning and design stage such as using less resources making our products lighter and smaller and using less
components we also implement various measures from the standpoint of resource recycling throughout the product life
cycle such as component reuse longer durability use of recycled resources easier battery removal and labels necessary
for collectionrecycling

examples of weight reduction and recyclable product design are also introduced in the following website

environment product recycling

global initiatives for used product recycling
aiming toward the effective use of natural resources and the prevention of environmental pollution a growing number of
recycling laws have been enacted in various countries throughout the world examples include the law for recycling of
specified kinds of home appliances home appliance recycling law and the act on the promotion of effective utilization
of resources in japan the weee directive in the european union and recycling laws in many states in the united
states in china as well a similar law has taken effect in addition to complying with the basel convention which controls
the transfer of hazardous waste to nonoecd countries as well as with related laws in respective countries we strive
to establish the most efficient recycling system in each country in view of its local recycling infrastructure including the
utilization of thirdparties

product recycling results in fiscal 2017 are as shown below because the collected products are becoming more compact
and lighter due to less volume of collection and recycling of crt tvs and more flat screen tvs and because the volume
of collection and recycling has decreased due to reforms of business areas in respective countries the weight is in a flat or
downward trend


fy2017 results
    japan           processed approx 138620 tons of four kinds of home appliances

product recycling initiatives in japan
in response to the home appliance recycling law of 2001 which covers four specified
kinds of home appliances we established ecology net co ltd jointly with toshiba
corporation which manages a geographically dispersed recycling network through
the effective use of existing recycling facilities nationwide the recycling management
company operates all the recyclingrelated services which includes supervising 343
designated collection sites shared with groups a and b and 30 recycling facilities on
behalf of the group a manufacturers 18 companies including panasonic our recycling

make recycling fees clearer and lower as well as to improve recycling rates3 as a result
the statutory recycling rate4 was revised in april 2015

panasonic recycling factories are working to further enhance resource recycling by improving the productivity and recycling
rates through efforts of applying different recycling methods according to the characteristics and materials of products

peteck has developed and put into practical use a spacesaving lowcost compact crushing and sorting system aiming
to efficiently sort air conditioner heat exchangers into single materials the system can crush heat exchangers in indoor
and outdoor air conditioner units as they are and removes grease with centrifugal force from highspeed rotating blades
on the crushing machine aluminum copper and iron are sorted by gravity and blower copper can be recovered at a high
purity of 99

in addition petec has introduced crushing and sorting lines for copper pipes and mixed metals in these lines copper
pipes cut and recovered from the air conditioner line as well as mixed metals mixture of copper and aluminum obtained
after removing iron and plastic from crushed refrigerators are crushed again and sorted to increase the resource values of
copper and aluminum

recycling efforts in the europe  cis region
in fiscal 2017 we collected approx 30000 tons5 of used products covered by the weee directive across europe

producers with online sales in germany and warehouse facility space of more than 400 m² have to offer their online
customers a weee takeback free of charge this is not just as before via the municipal collection but also via so called
nearby local shipping points panasonic germany took necessary action in this regards and ensured legal compliance
through offering a proper takeback solution to its online customers from july 2016 onwards

the russian waste law has been amended several times the most recent amendment came into force in january 2015
comprehensive law

a new decree sets environmental fee rates given the low collection targets the effective rates producers have to pay are
low in 20167 producers and importers must manage waste from their product and packaging waste either through self
compliance or a collective organization or pay an environmental fee the reporting requirements for self and collective
compliers producers and importers opting to not pay the environmental fee are laid out the fee rates allow attracting
significant investment in waste management infrastructure and establishing the russian recycling industry 14 members
including panasonic are registered as members of the newly formed collective organization epr ewaste recycling
panasonic is working on further developing appropriate regulations through the industry association ratek

promoting recycling activities in north america
panasonic continues its leadership role in establishing and operating a recycling system for waste batteries and consumer
electronic products in north america following the startup of a state recycling law in minnesota in july 2007 we
established the electronic manufacturers recycling management company llc mrm jointly with toshiba corporation
and sharp corporation in september of the same year and began recycling tvs pcs and other electronic equipment

with collaborative ties to several recycling companies mrm operates collection programs on behalf of 40 companies
across 20 states mrm has collected approximately 340592 tons since its inception in 2007 with the changes in
panasonics business strategies in the us in 2016 our remaining collection obligations are deminimis mrm will continue
operating its collection programs on behalf of the manufacturers it serves

as for waste batteries we established call2recycle in 1994 jointly with other battery manufacturers and now provide
recycling programs for rechargeable batteries throughout the us and canada call2recycle provides collection programs
and a robust retail collection network for over 300 companies and collected approx 6386 tons of rechargeable batteries
in the us and canada

recycling endoflife products in canada started in 2004 with the alberta government extended producer responsibility
epr regulation since then a total of 10 provinces and two territories have legislated weee each with their own
unique parameters and requirements in an effort to harmonize these programs panasonic canada takes active role in
the governance of the electronic product recycling association a notforprofit management organization which was
established with the mandate to standardize operations and bring about economies of scale on a national basis through
2200 collection sites they are now responsible for managing all the provincial programs with the exception of alberta and
the two territories as these three programs are under the direct jurisdictions of their governments and not industry the
currently active provincial epr programs have proven to be very effective in diverting ewaste as reflected in last years
totals where 127122 tons were collected and resulted in an average of 357 kg per capita in canada

initiatives in china
in china through the executive committee of foreign investment companies ecfic and other organizations we are
engaging in activities to clarify the definition of products covered by the second catalog published in february 2015 of the
regulation for the management of recycling and disposal of waste electrical and electronic products published in may
2012 and enforced in july of the same year as well as to gather information or submit comments on the establishment of
a fund unit price toward early disclosure of information by the chinese government including ministry of environmental
protection and the ministry of finance

we are also carrying out an assessment of developments in the plan on promoting extended producer responsibility
announced by the chinese government in january 2017 and reviewing our response

the australian government has announced a review of the product stewardship act in 2017 and panasonic australia will
engage in this review through industry group representation in addition panasonic australia is part of the battery industry
working group with the queensland government and other stakeholders to investigate the viability to establish voluntary
recycling for handheld batteries

regulators in malaysia thailand and singapore are also gearing towards the global trend of mandating responsible end
oflife product recycling discussions with regulators and industry bodies are in progress such examples include malaysia
department of environmentjapan international cooperation agency jica ewaste management mechanism development
project and thailand local industry association

through such engagements between the government and industry bodies panasonic hopes to contribute to the

panasonic has also been taking part in the consumer electronics and appliances manufacturers association ceama to
help develop the white paper containing reports on an analysis of current recycling activities in india and a longterm plan
for waste problem solutions the white paper with respect to ewaste channelization and eol of products was submitted
to the moefcc in october 2016

we are having various dialogues with the indian government jointly with ceama about the epr target and eol definition
for recycling management

we are also actively engaged in different active associations including the federation of indian chambers of commerce
and industry ficci and confederation of indian industry cii to establish an even more efficient and robust recycling
system and to submit industry comments to the indian government for a better governance system


recycling initiatives in latin america
as the trend of reinforcing environmental laws progresses in latin american countries discussions on establishment of
recycling laws and actual enforcement are being conducted

we are having dialogues with the brazilian government jointly with an industry association and retailers about
the establishment of local recycling systems through associação brasileira de reciclagem de eletroeletrônicos e
eletrodomésticos abree we are participating in the reverse logistics improvement project to which the japan
international cooperation agency jica has been extending technological cooperation for three years at the request of the
brazilian government and working on building an effective system in the test recovery program under the project we have
started for the first time in brazil to collect used appliances from customers homes after they purchase a large household
appliance in addition to collecting used appliances at the store based on collaboration with retailers and recyclers

under the recycling law that came into force in peru in 2016 we joined a nonprofit organization asociación peruana de
actores para la gestión de residuos aspager as a leading member and started a used products recovery program
through discussions with the government

in costa rica we have started collecting used products through unidad de cumplimiento para la gestión integral de
residuos electrónicos asegire a compliance organization for integrated management of waste electronics and a similar
program is underway in mexico under the governmentapproved recycling and management plan in colombia we formed
a recycling management organization under and alliance of manufacturers liaising with governmental organizations and
industrial groups and started collecting refrigerators from 2014 aiming to resolve ozone depletion issues

the legislation process has also been accelerated in chile and preparations are underway through continuous discussions
with the government to create a collection program in argentina we are participating in the latin american battery

an important role in enhancing recycled resin utilization by developing recycling
technologies such as a more efficient method for improving the purity of recycled resins recycled resin is generally weaker
in strength and has a shorter life than new resin this is why its chemical properties have to be recovered to the level of new
resin to make them usable as materials and components in new products the properties required by our customers vary
depending on the resin we have established techniques that make full use of the properties optimal to each resin such as
pp abs and ps which include adding antioxidants or mixing recycled and new resins

in fiscal 2017 development of highperformance materials started including the recycling of flame retardant ps from the
back covers of tv sets and flame retardant pp from nonwoven fabric a recycling method was also developed for ppgf pp
containing short glass fibers from drumtype washing machines that had not been recycled in the past into talcfilled pp with

building a recycling scheme for scrap iron
jointly with tokyo steel co ltd we started a recycling scheme for scrap iron in july 2013 in this scheme we recover the
scrap iron from used home appliances and tokyo steel makes it into steel sheets we then purchase the sheets back as a
material for our products supplying scrap iron for recycling and repurchasing the recycled iron is the first scheme of its kind
in the japanese electrical manufacturing industry

specifically scrap iron from home appliances collected and treated at petec is supplied to tokyo steels okayama plant
where the scrap iron is processed into electric steel plates1 panasonic procures the recycled steel plates and utilizes
them in products discussions with tokyo steel commenced in 2010 and we have worked together since then to improve
the quality of recycled iron to a level sufficient for production use as well as developing the technology to improve the
applicability of the recycled iron from this we identified the optimum application of the electric steel plates and refined
its specific features eg shape strength and weldability to meet applicationspecific requirements use of thin electric
steel plates in our products was first made possible in 2011 through this close collaboration we materialized this recycling
scheme in 2013 a scheme where a home appliance recycling company that we own supplies scrap iron to be used to
make electric steel plates

the amount of scrap iron we initially supplied to tokyo steel was about 50 tons per month in fiscal 2017 it reached over
2600 tons and the recycled steel is being used in our products including washing machines and ceiling materials for
housing

the increase in electric steel plate usage leads to an increase in the usage of scrap iron which is one of the most important
resources in japan in addition producing steel plates from scrap iron emits much less co2 compared with producing
steel plates from scratch this scheme also stabilizes the procurement price because the price of scrap iron supplied from
petec and the price of electric steel plates procured from tokyo steel are determined by the scrap iron fluctuation rate
agreed between the two companies we will further expand this recycling scheme for more efficient resource utilization

environment factory waste management  zero waste emissions

improving factory waste recycling rate
from the viewpoint of effective usage of resources we believe that generation of waste and revenuegenerating waste at
factories must be minimized even if such waste could be sold as valuable commodities based on this belief we identify
the amount of generated waste including both revenuegenerating waste and factory generated waste and classify it
into 1 recyclable waste including those that can be sold and those which can be transferred free of charge or by paying
a fee 2 waste that can be reduced by incineration or dehydration and 3 landfill waste with no option other than being
sent to landfills

we reduce the emission of waste by boosting yield in our production process and increasing the recycling rate of our
waste materials accordingly we strive globally toward achieving our zero waste emissions from factories1 goal by
reducing the amount of landfill to nearly zero we have reinforced such efforts particularly in china and other asian
countries where many of our factories are located we will continue our initiatives to achieve the factory waste recycling
rate target of 99 by fiscal 2019

as a means to reduce the generation of waste we are fostering resourcesaving product design in our production
activities we are engaging in resource loss reduction employing our own unique material flow analysis methods we
consider materials that do not become products and excessive use of consumables as resource losses and make the
material flow and lost values for each process visible in order to resolve the issues with close collaboration with the
design manufacturing and other relevant business divisions in the future we will promote further reductions in resource
losses through the resource loss navigation our original system developed to automatically display information to help
reduce resource losses

as measures to reduce the amount of landfill of waste and revenuegenerating waste we constrain the amount of waste
materials that are particularly difficult to recycle such as thermosetting resin we are also strictly adhering to waste
sorting practices in production processes to further expand the reuse of resources

because waste recycling rates in our overseas factories lag behind those in japan we have worked to improve the
average level of recycling activities by sharing information within and between regions outside japan specifically
in addition to accelerating the information sharing on waste recycling issues between our local factories and group
companies in japan we also promote the sharing of excellent examples and knowhow among our factories across
regions by utilizing ba charts2 prepared by each region following our longstanding approach toward co2 reduction

environment water resource conservation

approaches to water resource conservation
it is said that available fresh water is only about 001 of the earths total water resources in addition the world economic
forum host of the davos meetings has stated in its annual report on global risks that the water crisis continues to be one
of the top risks with global impact in view of the increase in water consumption to be caused by future economic growth
and population increases

with water shortages becoming an increasingly grave social problem panasonic is working to conserve water resources
both in its products and production activities in order to fulfill its social responsibility and to reduce management risks our
environmental policy page 14 stipulates that we make efforts to conserve water resources by using water efficiently and
preventing pollution in green plan 2018 our environmental action plan toward fiscal 2019 we aim to expand the range of
products that contribute to saving and recycling water at the same time we will work on reducing the volume of water we
consume and using more recycled water in our production processes in order to conserve water resources throughout our
business activities in risk management we are aiming to complete our water risk assessments for all our production sites
by fiscal 2019

concrete action that we have taken for this includes an evaluation of the scale of water risks in all regions where our
production sites are located in order to identify and mitigate the impact of our production activities on our use of water

in the evaluation we employ evaluation tools such as the mapping tool aqueduct by the world resources institute wri
and the water risk filter by the world wide fund for nature wwf which can not only assess the physical risks of water
shortages but also examine the risks in waterrelated regulations as well as reputation risks in each region we are also
making use of public databases available from respective national governments furthermore in areas with higher water
risks we are working to collect information through public local information as well as through interviews with relevant
organizations etc by conducting detailed analyses and close examination of such local information and production site data
including water use volume we will specifically identify the impacts on our production activities this water risk assessment
process aimed for completion in fiscal 2019 has progressed by roughly 50 so far although no obvious water risk that may
impact our business activities has been found at this point we will continue our evaluations at the same time we will work
to conserve water resources and reduce business risks in regions where water risks are determined to be high by focusing
on promotions to reduce water consumption and expand water recycling

to promote such activities we have established an environmental sustainability management system page 18 for these
activities including water management under the executive officer in charge of environmental affairs yoshiyuki miyabe
senior managing executive officer as of august 2017 and are aiming to raise the environmental management level by
implementing the pdca cycle

in addition we have established an environmental risk management system to continuously reduce risks and 1 identify
environmental risks and promote companywide risk management every fiscal year and 2 promptly respond to occurrence
of environmental risks see page 21 we will continue to manage our environmental risks through these activities

we are also a member of the water project a publicprivate collaborative project aimed at boosting awareness organized
under the initiative of japans ministry of the environment in 2014 its objective is to maintain a sound water cycle and
promote its recovery and presents waterrelated activities by business corporations as well as communicates information
on the importance of water as its activities we will work in cooperation with the japanese government and other
companies to conserve water resources


water resource conservation through products
by thoroughly analyzing the use of water through our products we have developed functionalities that allow a considerable
amount of water conservation by utilizing water at a maximum level through improvement of water flow control and cyclic
use in fiscal 2012 we enhanced one of the criteria water conservation in our green product accreditation criteria see
page 2830 and are speeding up the development of industryleading products that contribute to water saving

initiatives for water resource conservation through production activities
by collecting and reusing wastewater from our manufacturing                         water consumption in production activities and water
processes and air conditioning systems we reduce the                               consumption per basic unit

minimizes their impact on human health and the environment by 2020 in support of the precautionary approach proposed
in the rio declaration made at the earth summit in 1992 we have been manufacturing products in line with our basic policy
of reducing the use of chemical substances that might adversely affect human health and the environment throughout their
lifecycles as specific initiatives we aim to reduce the environmental impact of our products by 1 identifying hazardous
substances contained in our products 2 evaluating these substances on their environmental impact and 3 voluntarily
reducing or discontinuing their use in case of any environmental risks

to promote our initiatives clearly we set forth our chemical substances management rank guidelines which prohibit or
specify certain substances for management in terms of our products and factory activities companies in the panasonic
group are requested to follow the guidelines and suppliers are also requested for support as necessary in fiscal 2013
we added level 3 to the chemical substances management rank guidelines for products to review the timing for the
prohibition of further substances that may adversely affect humans and the environment in addition to the current and
forthcoming prohibitions

management of chemical substances in products
to minimize the environmental impact of chemical substances contained in products we endeavor to identify chemical
substances used in the components and materials of our products in addition for substances that are prohibited in
products in major developed countries due to legislation such as the european rohs directive we specify prohibited
substances to globally ensure that they are not used or contained in our products except in certain cases where
substitution of the substances is infeasible we will also conduct environmental impact assessments for managed
substances contained in our products take steps to reduce the use of substances where the impact on human health and
the environment cannot be ignored and plan to eventually prohibit the use


identifying chemical substances in products
to contribute to the achievement of the global goals set at the wssd it is important for us to disclose and communicate
information on the chemical substances used in our products across the supply chain for which we must promote cross
industrial initiatives to establish and disseminate an effective system we are a member of the joint article management
promotion consortium jamp together with about 440 major companies from various industries such as chemical
component and equipment manufacturers we are proactively formulating utilizing and disseminating chemical substance
management standards and systems through this organization since fiscal 2005 we have been using a product chemical
substance management system to gather data concerning the chemical substances contained in the components and
materials for our products from our suppliers in july 2009 we asked our suppliers to submit the data in a common format
by jamp and approx 10000 suppliers are currently using this format

meanwhile in japan alone burden on companies grew as a number of hazardous substance inspections were carried out
throughout the supply chain using formats unique to each company that were not standardized such as the jamp format
for information communication the ministry of economy trade and industry recognized this issue and presented a new
scheme chemsherpa for sharing and exchanging information about chemicals contained in components and products
throughout the supply chain because chemsherpa follows the standardized jamp format to communicate information
panasonic has joined the scheme and adopted the use as the informationgathering format in its system we plan to
replace the current jamp mechanism with chemsherpa by june 2018 when the jamp support and maintenance period
will discontinue excluding communication of information on automotive equipment for the automobile sector for which the
industrys standard information sharing system is already established

in addition with the supply chain expanding to a global scale it is particularly important for overseas suppliers to deepen
their understanding on the handling of hazardous chemical substances towards a full changeover to the chemsherpa
format we will continue to promote the use to our suppliers through collaboration with jamp and jamp counterparts in
respective countries

companies that procure electronic components may need to have a full understanding of the substances contained in the
components at the point of selection or usage in order to adhere to the eu rohs directive and reach regulation
particularly as the reach substances of very high concern svhc list is updated every six months those companies
expect their suppliers to provide the latest substance data to demonstrate compliance with the list

also as a company supplying electronic components to other companies we have published a table of rohs and reach
compliance status on our website since november 2012 so that our clients can obtain relevant chemical substance
information from us quickly and efficiently the table covers our rohs directive compliance information and the substances
designated in the rohs  reach confirmation report for all our major generic electronic components

in june 2015 the act on preventing environmental pollution of mercury was established to implement measures agreed
in the minamata convention on mercury the act requires manufacturers of products containing mercury to provide
information such as labelling so that such products are appropriately sorted and discharged when being disposed of we
have established a new webpage information based on the act on the preventing environmental pollution of mercury in
may 2017 to communicate information concerning the mercury used in our products to customers

assessing the impact of chemical substances
scientifically identifying the impact on human health and the environment of products containing chemical substances is vital
to the development of products with low environmental impact we are engaging in activities designed to assess the levels
to which customers are exposed to substances of very high concern svhc as well as safety at the time of product use

to date we have undertaken assessments on the impact of ceramic fibers used in certain models of commercial microwave
ovens as part of our efforts to comply with the eu reach regulation which requires preparing information for the safe
use of products containing a certain amount of svhc we have created and disclosed a safety assessment document the
exposure was considered to be nominal with little concern for any impact on human health furthermore usage of ceramic
fibers in our products was discontinued in december 2010

reduction in usage and emissions of chemical substances
fluorocarbons used as a heat insulator and a refrigerant
for freezers and air conditioners can damage the ozone
layer and cause global warming we developed the
technology to utilize co2 which has much smaller
impact than fluorocarbons as a refrigerant and have
been supplying a home boiler using co2 refrigerant
since 2001 although the co2 refrigerant is suitable for
heating purposes it was difficult to apply to refrigerators
and freezers especially in large professional equipment
due to insufficient cooling efficiency and size problems
                                                                 ocucr2001mvf a fluorocarbon     fpwev085 a display case
however with support from the new energy and industrial
                                                                 free freezer using co2 refrigerant compatible with a fluorocarbon
technology development organization nedo we                                                      free freezer
developed a refrigeration system using co2 refrigerant
and started supplying these fluorocarbonfree freezers and refrigerator display cases to supermarkets and convenience
stores in japan from 2010 by the end of march 2017 we delivered roughly 5800 units to approx 2200 stores

making the best use of our expertise in the japanese market in may 2017 we also started sales of fluorocarbonfree
co2 freezers designed for small stores and prefabricated refrigeratorfreezers for the european market where fgas
regulations and other environmental regulations are in place we released the product in norway denmark sweden and
belgium aiming to sell more than 300 units in the first year we plan to expand the market to other countries including
germany and holland


in addition as measures against ozone depletion caused by hcfcs a refrigerant called r410 that does not deplete
the ozone layer was used in compact air conditioners but this substance has a very high global warming potential
gwp panasonic then developed a model that uses a new refrigerant r32 which has a lower gwp and introduced it
to the market in 2013 furthermore pt panasonic manufacturing indonesia which owns the factory for manufacturing
compact air conditioners in indonesia redesigned its production facility that used an ozonedepleting hcfc refrigerant
r22 to one using r32 in fiscal 2015 and commenced supplying new r32based air conditioners panasonic contributed
to the indonesian governments initiative to eliminate the use of hcfcs

mercury lamps are currently widely used as the light source for projectors because they provide high luminosity easily
however mercury can have a serious impact on human health and the environment if not treated properly and the short
life of the lamps causes high consumption of resources as well as high environmental
impact for these reasons panasonic is developing products that adopt laser light
sources the ptrz31k series are projectors for professional use that provide high
luminosity by employing a highoutput semiconductor laser light source module
and a heatresistant phosphor wheel in addition the casing material does not use
halogenated flame retardant making the projector an ecoconscious product that
contributes to reducing the use of hazardous substances                                                               ptrz31k series a laser

reducing the use of pvc resin
polyvinyl chloride pvc is a material of concerns to the generation of hazardous substances from inappropriate disposal
as well as the harmful effects of certain additive agents phthalates used to render pvc more pliable in light of the
significant potential for inappropriate disposal of the pvc resin used in the internal wiring of products due mainly to
difficulties associated with the sorting of this resin from used products we have switched our new products launched from
april 2011 to nonpvc

we specified these substances as level 2 prohibited substances in our chemical substances management rank
guidelines ver 10 for products issued in june 2016 and delivery of such substances will be prohibited from july 22
2018 we have specified other phthalates as level 3 prohibited substances and are promoting substitution

as for the four phthalates we are currently working on creating an analysis and assessment system to ensure substitution

since phthalates have a migration characteristic where a substance from another article migrates through contact
materials may be contaminated by migration from production equipment as well as process equipment containing the four
phthalates specified as level 2 prohibited substances accordingly we are also discussing management of preventive
measures against contamination through contact

management of chemical substances at factories
panasonic is working to minimize environmental impact by identifying the hazardous substances used in our products
assessing the impact of such use and voluntarily discontinuing the use or reducing the release of such substances since
1999 we have been conducting the 3350 reduction activity to materialize reduction by 33 in three years and by 50 in
six years in japan we started promoting cutbacks in the use release and transfer of chemical substances at our factories
in fiscal 2000 against the target in our voluntary action plan a reduction by 50 from the fiscal 1999 level we achieved
a 75 reduction in chemical substance use and a 62 reduction in release and transfer in fiscal 2005 since then we
have been continuing the activity focusing on substances with particularly large amounts of release and transfer setting
a voluntary action target of reduction by 30 compared to the fiscal 2006 level as a result we achieved a 46 reduction
in the amounts of release and transfer of specified key reductiontarget substances across all factories worldwide in fiscal
2011

reflecting international trends in chemical substance management our reduction measures have focused increasingly on
particularly hazardous substances from fiscal 2011 our chemical substances management rank guidelines for factories
was established in 1999 as a guideline to help manage the above chemical substance reduction activities in version 1
the guidelines specified a list of chemical substances to be managed mainly focusing on carcinogenic substances the
guidelines were later updated to version 2 in 2000 to include rules concerning the japan prtr law version 3 introduced
in 2004 additionally covered a list of substances specified by chemical substances management legislation in japan the
chemical substances covered by version 4 and later from 2009 are those specified in legislation on human health and
environmental impact in japan the us and europe as well as those specified under international treaties

under our chemical substances management rank guidelines for factories we have focused our management on
select chemical substances that are hazardous to human health and the environment further we have created a unique
indicator the human environment impact6 which is used globally in all our factories conventionally the chemical
substances were managed by quantity such as usage amount or emissionsrelease however such quantitybased
management has a problem in that some highly hazardous substances do not become subject to reduction or management
if the usage amount was small and therefore would fall out of the scope of impact assessments in addition the toxicity
criteria varied according to substance types and regional legislation which made standardized management across the
group difficult to address this issue panasonic worked together with experts from both within and outside the company
reclassified chemical substances based on an overall assessment of their hazardousness and specified a hazardousness
factor for each classification specifically we set a hazard classification to each substance by utilizing carcinogen risk
assessments issued by international organizations together with publically available hazard information and lists of ozone
depleting substances for substances that have multiple hazard information items the item ranked with the highest hazard
risk is used for classification we utilize this internal indicator as the human environmental impact indicator to promote
efforts to ensure reduction of highly hazardous substances with greater environmental impacts such as carcinogens and
ozone depleting substances according to the risk level the panasonic group chemical substances management rank
guidelines is also available on the website on our green procurement activities to promote collaboration with our suppliers
encouraging them to offer materials that do not contain hazardous substances

in fiscal 2017 we were able to reduce human environmental impact by 48 compared to fiscal 2011 by substituting
highly hazardous substances in paints improving yields promoting recycling introducing substances with lowsolvents
and hazards and improving processes including reviewing the amount of paint or the number of washing cycles as well
as improving the efficiency of removaldeodorization equipment we will continue our initiatives to minimize the amount of
substances with environmental impact released through our production activities

environment biodiversity conservation

approaches to biodiversity
business management and human life in our society is founded on the ecosystem servicesa multitude of natures
blessings provided by our natural capital including soil air water and animals and plants it is important to preserve
biodiversity to sustain the benefits derived from this natural capital towards the future however this biodiversity is
experiencing significant damage at an unprecedented speed

the 13th meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity cop13 was held in december
2016 at the meeting business entities were urged to incorporate conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity
mainstreaming of biodiversity promote activities to achieve the 2020 aichi biodiversity targets and consider the
sustainable development goals sdgs adopted by the united nations

we are committed to properly understanding the impact of our business activities on biodiversity and contributing to
conservation to this end we are promoting initiatives in cooperation with local governments environmental conservation
ngos and specialized agencies we focus on the three key areas of land use procurement and products in order
to promote biodiversity conservation as an initiative incorporated into our businesses in promoting the key areas we
formulate a biodiversity action plan bap which is the basic concept of article 6 of the convention on biological diversity
and implement measures check the achievement progress and improve the initiatives


initiatives in land use
green areas in our business sites can potentially contribute to conserving biodiversity in that area in particular hardly
any natural environments where wild animals can live and breed remain in urban areas therefore even small areas of
green in corporate premises can become a precious environment for a variety of living organisms if they retain indigenous
vegetation and a watery environment

in terms of biodiversity such green areas take on the roles of reinforcing the ecological network including connections with
green areas and parks dotted around the neighborhood as well as protecting rare fauna and flora in the area


preservation of biotopes in collaboration with governments and experts
an ecological network refers to the organic relationship between ecological spaces such as the greenery and waters
where a variety of creatures lives and breeds the greenery in our sites helps expand the overall space where wild animals
including birds butterflies and dragonflies live as they can fly from one green area to another dotted in the area in
addition protecting wild fauna and flora in local areas is an activity in collaboration with governments and with help and
advice of experts to preserve endangered species designated by the ministry of the environment or local government that
are deemed to be disappearing from that area the kusatsu factory of the panasonic appliances company in kusatsu
city shiga prefecture promotes this activity its kyozonnomori forest forest of coexistence underwent assessment
during its development in 2009 and continues to undergo monitoring by experts other examples include the biotope at the
eco solutions company in kadoma city osaka prefecture that concluded the osaka biodiversity partnership agreement
with the government of osaka prefecture osaka prefecture university and the research institute of environment
agriculture and fisheries as well as tsunagari no hiroba at panahome corporation that was set up with the participation
as part of osaka prefectures project to create green wind streets and conclusion of the aforementioned agreement with
osaka prefecture toyonaka city osaka prefecture university and the research institute of environment agriculture and
fisheries

environment that encourages habitation for local wildlife                        deadwood planted in forests

since then the formulation of the factory green space
management policy was combined with diligent conservation efforts such as changing lawn into sawgrass placing of
deadwood and replacing trees of foreign origin resulting in an increase in reproduction levels for birds and butterflies
confirmation of these concrete results led to an upgrade in the evaluation ranking to level a in september 2015 which
was the year for certification renewal the upgrade in ranking not only recognizes our biodiversity conservation effect
objectively but also holds great significance for further development of our efforts

initiatives in products
together with the ngo birdlife international we have established a thirdparty assessment system to provide customers
with information about product contributions to biodiversity through this system we have assessed products which are
closely linked to biodiversity

we have also enhanced our green product accreditation criteria see pages 2830 by adding biodiversity to the existing
items we define products that contribute to biodiversity conservation as those that use biodiversityconscious materials in
their major components and those that include functions to help biodiversity conservation

in fiscal 2014 panasonic environmental systems  engineering co ltd developed atpsbluesys a ballast water
management system bwms to reduce disturbance from maritime transportation of the marine ecology of local sea
areas ballast water is sea water used to retain the balance of a freight vessel at sea when it is not carrying shipment
because the ship travels across the sea taking sea water from one port and then draining the water into another port the
impact of foreign organisms such as plankton and bacteria on the local ecology environment and resources is becoming
an increasingly serious problem atpsbluesys treats microorganisms in the water with inline electrolysis without using
filters which is the first in japan the system can treat the water to a level lower than the standards by the international
maritime organization imo and successfully acquired the imo g9 basic approval g9ba marketing of this system will
be launched in fiscal 2018 as it acquired equivalent designation by system atpsbluesys received type approval from
the japanese ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism in march 2017

environment collaboration across the supply chain
collaboration with suppliers and transportation partners
as a company backed by a number of suppliers we must consider the environmental impacts of our entire supply chain
and not just of our own operations through our coordination efforts with suppliers and transportation partners who
form an integral part of our business operations we strive to minimize our environmental impact across the entire supply
chain focusing on the reduction of co2 emissions resource recycling chemical substance management and biodiversity
conservation


activities for green procurement
since the publication of the green procurement standards in 1999 we have been promoting the manufacture of eco
conscious products in partnership with our suppliers furthermore in the green procurement standards we set out
the establishment of a group of suppliers who support our environmental policy in supplying products and goods in
order to materialize the targets in supplier collaboration in our green plan 2018 in addition to cooperation in reducing
environmental impact in supplier business operations and sharing achievements through collaboration we are asking
our suppliers to seek the cooperation of upstream business partners to expand the scope of activities of reducing
environmental impact throughout the entire supply chain

also based on the green procurement standards we have been conducting the green procurement survey where we
monitor the implementation status of our suppliers regarding our requests to promote environmental impact reduction
activities more effectively with our suppliers in fiscal 2013 we conducted a trial survey targeted at our major global
suppliers we received responses from 415 companies and were able to confirm the level of activity in areas such as
environmental management system development thorough implementation of chemical substance management reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions promotion of resource recycling and biodiversity conservation from fiscal 2014 we have
replaced surveys conducted on a groupwide scale with surveys at a site level as a means of communication with our
suppliers

in china seminars on our csr procurement policy and chinese environmental regulations were held in september 2016
for more than 400 suppliers in guangzhou dalian and shanghai by calling for exhaustive implementation of csr through
the supply chain by using the csr selfassessment checklist as well as sharing chinas latest environmental regulations
we are making efforts to grasp the risks and reduce environmental impacts across the supply chain

in response to the enhancement of regulations such as eu rohs directive we have been engaging in continual
environmental quality assurance audits of our suppliers since 2005 to improve the management level throughout the entire
supply chain in fiscal 2017 we assessed the environmental quality assurance systems of some 1400 suppliers and have
supported their efforts to upgrade their management levels

estimation of environmental impacts in business activities by suppliers
in order to assess greenhouse gas ghg emissions across the entire supply chain scope 31 we made our original
calculations based on the greenhouse gas protocol the international accounting standard for ghg emissions since fiscal
2012 we have conducted assessment surveys on four occasions with the cooperation of 185 suppliers in the areas of raw
materials electrical and electronic components and processed parts

from fiscal 2012 we started estimating our overall ghg emissions in the upstream range by multiplying the volume of
materials purchased with the resourcespecific ghg emissions per basic unit based on the inputoutput table published
by the japanese government the estimation results based on fiscal 2016 data is 1291 million tons roughly five times the
ghg emissions of our own production activities
1 other indirect emissions excluding scope 1 direct emissions from facilities owned and controlled by panasonic and scope 2 emissions from
  production of energy consumed at facilities owned and controlled by panasonic

sharing achievements through collaboration
since fiscal 2010 we have been implementing the ecovc2 activity with our suppliers this program is a collaboration
between panasonic and our suppliers aimed to both reduce environmental impact as well as reinforce product
capability and achieve further rationalization for our products and our suppliers in fiscal 2010 the target for reducing
environmental impact was limited to energy saving co2 emission reduction however this was extended in fiscal 2011 to
recyclingoriented manufacturing aiming at saving resources and using recycled materials the geographical range of our
activities has also extended initially centered in japan actions accelerated to china and other parts of asia in fiscal 2013
and later extended to a global scale in fiscal 2015

ecovc activities are stored in a database for effective use within the panasonic group furthermore exemplary activities
are recognized through awards at the eco vc presentation of awardsreception meeting these activity presentations are
also shown at the meeting venue to be shared with suppliers for use and application in future activities

although the number of cases presented by suppliers in fiscal 2017 fell from the previous year to 622 many excellent
proposals were presented one of the outstanding practiced recognized and selected was reduction of electric power
consumption with automotive infotainment system mcu by renesas electronics this achieves vc of reducing co2
emissions of the entire system by 60 while dramatically improving both the performance and system costs with an
rh850 system mcu in the automotive infotainment system

going forward we will expand ecovc activities with as many suppliers as possible through greater application of value
engineering ve methodologies by reducing environmental impacts and reinforcing product capability and with further
rationalization we will strengthen partnerships with our suppliers

environment human resource development

encouraging all employees to become practitioners of environmental activities
we believe that the development of human resources is important in laying the foundations and promoting environmental
sustainability management to put this into action a training curriculum is in place for each specialty and position general
programs are organized for all employees to acquire environmental knowledge as well as learn about our environmental
policy and activities specialized programs are designed to bring employees environmental skills to an advanced level

general programs are held every year at each business site for employees to acquire a wide range of knowledge such
as energy problems trends in global society and environmental activities by panasonic additionally training catered to
the distinctive features of each operation is organized to provide information directly linked to business and operational
activities other creative initiatives that we continue include environmental sustainability education to new employees and
engineeringrelated employees using exclusive textbooks specific to their respective job experiences and skills to enable
them to practice environmental action in their job activities

in fiscal 2017 twelve courses were held in the specialized programs such as iso 14001 internal environmental auditor
training environmental legislation chemical substance management and factory energy conservation diagnosis and a
total of 139 people took the courses

the programs are not limited to employees in environmentrelated job functions and allow attendance of those in related
divisions to expand the scope of practitioners of environmental activities


fostering environmental awareness and skills through global competitions
and onsite training
the eco mind skills competition and energy conservation diagnosis skills
competition are held as environmentrelated events in the panasonic group
manufacturing skills competition held annually for panasonic employees
worldwide aimed at training employees to acquire advanced skills and become
top runners in panasonic manufacturing we hope that these events will bring
greater environmental awareness and continuous environmental activities among

technology working group and it has strengthened standards relating to major safety issues such as longterm use
flameretarding measures and fall prevention in fiscal 2017 it prioritized preventing lithiumion batteries from catching fire
by establishing standards that should be followed for applicable products that use such batteries

group created the panasonic system safety standards psss which cover energy management and other systems to
ensure the safety of panasonics personal care robots the working group established the panasonic personal care robot
safety standards prss

fundamental stance is thus to provide customers with trust peace of mind and satisfaction


  the fundamental concept of customer satisfaction the pursuit of customer satisfaction
  the only way for those of us engaged in business to earn trust is to have everyone regardless of whether they are
  working in the manufacturing division or the sales division cater completely to the demands of the customers on
  all points and work strictly under the basic rule of producing or selling not even one product that cannot perform its
  function well

 perfection can be reached only by paying careful attention not only to the manufacturing details but also to where our
 products are going and making efforts to completely satisfy the customers and provide flawless service

                                                                                                                   konosuke matsushita

  service philosophy true service
  the customers satisfaction is our satisfaction
  true service resides in mutual satisfaction
  service is an integral part of any business a business that does not provide service is no business at all service
  therefore is the duty and obligation of any business person but theres nothing more aggravating than service provided
  only out of a sense of duty customers can sense it

  service means satisfying customers and when we satisfy our customers we in turn find satisfaction in a job well done

  satisfied customers and satisfied employees this is what constitutes true service

customer inquiry response system
in japan panasonic deals with inquiries from customers before they purchase products as well as with their concerns
about how to use them after purchase through the customer care center the customer care center is open from 900
am to 800 pm 365 days per year there are separate phone numbers for each product customers rarely spend a long
time on hold the customer care center is organized to provide accurate and rapid service

when customers make inquiries on the panasonic website by typing in a question the site displays multiple relevant faqs
thus the company strives to provide quick responses to questions

regarding the content of its faq pages the company analyzes the search keywords that bring customers to faqs as well
as the number of times that the questions are viewed to increase the precision of the faqs so that the information that
customers require is accurate and displayed quickly

in recent years the company has also been undertaking initiatives to use facebook and other social media outlets to post
various types of useful information in a timely manner such as when the seasons change and to entice customers to visit
relevant faq pages

because these faqs are organized so that customers problems can be solved without the customer needing to contact
the customer care center the number of inquiries at the center is trending downward

panasonic operates call centers in each countryregion outside of japan as well handling all types of inquiries as well as
intake for repairs

the website for each country includes faqs and we are working on building ways to allow customers to resolve their own
issues as they are able to in japan

fair operating practices performance evaluation

to monitor the understanding of compliance policies the effectiveness of measures and the degree of adherence once
each year we conduct checks on the status of observance and practice of the panasonic code of conduct in all our
business locations around the world

more specifically at each group member company a director  executive officer is appointed to be in charge of ensuring
adherence to the code of conduct education and training are conducted regarding the code of conduct written pledges
regarding the observance of the code of conduct are obtained and checks are made regarding the status of these items
our auditor conducts an audit of internal control


once each year employees fill out compliance awareness surveys these surveys include topics that are common
globally such as compliance and information security and also other topics that are specific to particular companies
places of business and regions there were around 126000 respondents globally in fiscal 2017 the survey results are
analyzed from a variety of perspectives  region company employee rank and so on  and are used in a wide variety of
functions such as the formulation of policies and measures regarding compliance and responses to specific issues

for example there are uneven levels of legislation depending on the country within asiawhich panasonic considers
a strategic overseas region this region poses considerable risks in regard to panasonics efforts to combat corruption
in this business environment in order to develop fair and powerful solution business  including btob and btog  we
were able to identify issues through this survey such as 1 the need for ongoing efforts to instill compliance awareness
2 the need for repetition of compliance education and 3 the national differences in compliance awareness based on
these results various elements were incorporated in the midterm action plan to practice in the daily business activities
including 1 the formulation of action guidelines and education campaigns at the level of the regional headquarter 2 the
strengthening of elearning and training programs in each national language and 3 the fortification of alliances involving
legal departments in each region and the raising of the level of compliance through auditing


grave violations and corrective measures
in fiscal 2017 panasonic paid fines for violations of eu competition law relating to its cathode ray tube and secondary
battery businesses having taken this development seriously panasonic has continued to work to ensure that through
complete and thorough management such issues do not arise again for information about panasonics policies for
preventing cartels refer to the chapter on fair operating practices fair trade

in the rare event that panasonic becomes aware of any serious ethical or legal violations we stop the violating behavior
immediately and in addition to reporting to executive management we will consider countermeasures after verifying facts
and analyzing the causes of the violation in relevant divisions we report on such matters to the board of directors as
necessary and correct the violations swiftly and crosssectionally groupwide based on the resolution of the board

fair operating practices fair trade

panasonic believes that cartels and bribery of government officials can have critical effects on management throughout the
entire group and it acts to combat these phenomena as a group in more specific terms within the control environment
prevention detection and response framework discussed below each company and regional headquarters establish
an annual compliance program such as the one shown below based on the understanding of the risks that it faces with
its business and in its region at the end of the fiscal year company president or regional head is required to certify the
effective functioning of the program to the panasonic president supervisory organizations relating to these practices have
been established in departments at the panasonic headquarters and these organizations provide oversight and support for
initiatives in companies and regional headquarters

 control environment particularly during compliance awareness month the president company presidents and regional
  heads issue compliance messages targeting employees in each company compliance workshop among the business
  division directors is held helping to foster a culture of compliance in all business divisions
 prevention elearning is provided in eight languages for the people responsible within the organizations of relevant
  departments in fiscal 2017 around 31600 people underwent this training in fiscal 2016 and 2017 group study sessions
  were conducted with management from overseas companies in total around 7800 people attended to improve the
  effectiveness of panasonics anticartel and antibribery of government officials regimes each location conducts self
  checks to examine the operation status of cartel prevention measures including the functioning of company rules and
  offering of education and each company or regional headquarters reviews or audits these selfchecks
 detection hotlines have been established at the group headquarters in companies and at regional headquarters these
  hotlines are publicized through educational activities
 internal investigations are conducted immediately when behavior suspected of constituting a violation is discovered
  through auditing or a hotline tipoff
 response if internal investigations have confirmed that violations occurred the violation is immediately halted the true
  cause is pursued measures to prevent reoffense are implemented and the people involved are disciplined


preventing cartels
we at panasonic are taking the fact that our company has been implicated in multiple international cartel incidents
seriously and we have positioned the prevention of cartels as a critical groupwide issue if panasonic were to become
involved in the creation of a cartel we would not only lose the trust of our customers but also be required to pay high
penalties and compensation for damages as well as lose our designation in public procurement we take very serious and
detailed care to prevent any such involvement because it would have a variety of negative impacts on our business


basic policies
we have put the following basic policies in place in an effort to prevent cartels collusive bidding and other such violations

 contact with competitors is allowed only in absolutely necessary cases and subject to prior approval
 agreements and exchanges of information with competitors regarding prices quantity and other competitionrelated
  matters are strictly prohibited
 one who encounters behaviors that may give rise to suspicions of cartel must make an objection leave the room and file
  an internal report
 the company establishes whistleblowing systems and internal leniency systems to improve its ability to selfregulate and
  conduct appropriate monitoring based on risk assessment whereby maintains an effective anticartel system


rules concerning activity and relationship with competitors
in 2008 we established the rules concerning activity and relationship with competitors for the purpose of preventing
behaviors that could lead to cartels or bid rigging or cause suspicion of same which apply to all group employees these
rules include items such as the following

 prior approval system under which contact with competitors requires prior approval of the head of the business group
  and the person in charge of legal affairs
 responses to inappropriate activities
 duty of reporting possible violations
 measures taken in response to violations
 internal leniency system

in the device business where the risk of cartels is particularly high we are promoting global initiatives meant to prevent
cartels through activities including making sure once again that these policies are fully understood by executives at
company management conferences and managing directors conferences at overseas subsidiaries cartel prevention
training for all employees identifying suspicious behaviors submitting written pledges conducting cartel audits and
speeding up personnel rotations


preventing corruption
prevention of bribery of government officials
even as the authorities in different countries continue to bear down harder on corruption along with the expansion of
business in developing countries and solutions business comes a higher risk of bribery of public officials panasonic
continues to engage in efforts to prevent bribery of government officials through means such as issuing bribery prevention
policies from senior executives establishing standards and approval processes for spending on meals and the like with
public officials managing business partners and ensuring that training and awarenessraising activities for executives and
employees are thoroughly carried out especially for business sites located in countries and regions which are considered
to have a high level of corruption


rules on dealing with government officials
in 2010 we established the rules on dealing with government officials for the purpose of preventing bribery of
government officials or actions that my raise suspicions of such unlawful behavior

these rules stipulate that no employee may offer give pay for promise to pay for or authorize the payment or the grant of
any benefit to any government officials in connection with obtaining or retaining business

an approval process and specific standards were established such as for meals with government officials these are
intended to prevent the direct offering of benefit to government officials and also the indirect offering of benefit through
consultants distributors lobbyists or other business partners careful screening and designation of business partners
must be conducted and contracts must include provisions prohibiting bribery

in cases of violations of these rules swift steps must be taken to redress the situation and strict measures must be taken
against the violation

in addition regarding expenses for social interactions or gifts prior approval is required and detailed reports must be filed
there is also a process for ensuring that no government officials are involved in an effort to preclude corrupt acts


ensuring transparency with political contribution funds
the japan business federation says of political donations in order to maintain democratic politics in a proper
manner matching costs are required and it is important for businesses to make political donations as part of their
social contribution panasonic abides by this policy and makes political donations as a part of its corporate social
responsibilities

when making donations panasonic complies with the political funds control act all other relevant legislation and with its
own strict rules

in japan the legal duty of disclosing political fund income and expenditures falls on political groups these disclosures are
publicly available from the official gazette or from official prefectural bulletins

respect for human rights performance evaluation

as a company doing business in countries around the world panasonic strives to respect human rights and considers it a
precondition for all its behavior to abide by international standards the laws and regulations of each country or region and
the panasonic code of conduct

further to these efforts since 2007 the company has been conducting overseas human resources and labor
assessments intended to identify comprehend and resolve issues in personnel management and labor management
overseas the checklist used in the survey contains around 300 items including those concerning proper implementation
of labor management compliance with local labor laws employment systems and business practices and discovery of
bad influences on business and of latent laborrelated risks that could cause problems

after the local affiliate has conducted a selfassessment based on the checklist an assessor who belongs to a company
or business division in japan performs an audit with the support of the regional headquarters efforts to resolve problems
discovered via assessments are undertaken primarily by assessorleaders mainly managers in charge of human
resources who strive to raise the level of labor management panasonic periodically runs assessor seminars to
systematically promote the education of assessors and to raise the levels of their checking skills

in fiscal 2017 assessments were conducted at a total of 6 sites consisting of 2 sites in china and 4 sites elsewhere in
asia panasonic will continue to strive to improve labor management capabilities through close partnerships between its
japanese and overseas locations thereby to improve the companys ability to respect human rights in all its businesses

furthermore since fiscal 2015 panasonic has implemented risk assessment and improvement efforts based on a
selfassessment checklist relating to human rights and labor that was established that year we have expanded the
implementation of these to manufacturing sites within japan in fiscal 2017 engaging in efforts toward selfassessments as
well as corrections and improvements at 98 sites worldwide

because issues with working hours management have been observed at some companies through selfassessments we
have proposed improvement plans that include revisions to the organization of personnel work management methods and
equipment automation and are moving forward in our efforts to correct these issues


in addition panasonic receives audits from the clients that we supply we were audited 17 times in fiscal 2017 and we are
engaged in correcting and improving the areas that our clients have indicated may be problematic in terms of human rights
and labor standards these efforts include reviewing our work regulations and management methods




                                                                           106

to collect any fees and are not retaining workers passports or identification documents as well as ensuring that they
are providing workers with employment contracts including terms of employment in those workers native languages

irrespective of differences such as race sex age nationality beliefs religion social status disability sexual orientation and
gender identity and can work in a lively and active manner in a supportive environment with consideration of the laws and
regulations of each country

managing working hours
based on labor standards legislation in the respective countries and on labor agreements panasonic has established in its
work regulations provisions relating to appropriate working hours break times overtime work holidays leave and so forth

to abide by these provisions the company operates a workinghours management system and is also engaged in
comprehensive employee health management

with a work management system panasonic has implemented a variety of measures with an eye to employees health
including a mechanism by which warnings are issued and other steps are taken at the point when a certain length of
overtime has been reached optimal placement of personnel so that overtime is not overly imposed on only certain
employees and additional health checks performed in the rare event that an employee has worked excessively long hours


managing wages
based on labor standards legislation in the respective countries and on labor agreements panasonic has established in its
employee wage regulations provisions for adequate wages allowances for commuting and other expenses bonuses other
compensation paid on occasional bases retirement allowance and so forth

the company has implemented a role  grade system that determines compensation based on the work or role in which
employees are currently engaged there are no genderbased inequalities in this compensation system

in japan to ascertain whether employees wages are being paid correctly labor unions conduct annual surveys of wage
conditions among their members and check whether those members are being properly paid the salaries resulting from
wage negotiations decided between labor and management

overseas panasonic establishes by country company regulations that comply with all wagerelated laws and regulations
pertaining to matters such as the minimum wage statutory benefits and overtime the company conducts its operations
based on these regulations andfor the specified period of payment and at the specified time of paymentnotifies its
employees through pay statements and electronic data and pays them directly

in cases where the laws of the country or region in question do not prohibit monetary disciplinary action panasonic
recognized such disciplinary action as a possibility and does not prohibit it however this is all predicated on the
procedures for such actions as well as the monetary amounts involved being established within legal limits with
consideration given to the impact on the recipients life as well as such measures being codified in internal regulations and
made well known to employees japanese law does not prohibit monetary discipline but panasonics disciplinary rules
within japan do not include monetary disciplinary measures


the freedom of association and respect for the right to collective bargaining
panasonic believes that the freedom of association combined with the right to collective bargaining is one of the
fundamental human rights that companies should respect

in countries and regions that permit the formation of labor unionsfor instance in japanpanasonic and the panasonic
group workers union association have stipulated in their labor agreement that unions retain the rights to organize to
collectively bargain and to strike

in addition even in countries and regions where the formation of labor unions is not permitted because of legislation
regulations or conventional labor practices the panasonic code of conduct stipulates the de facto promotion of issue
resolution through labormanagement dialogues which are the goals of the principles of the freedom of association and
the right to collective bargaining in addition the company expressly lists these dialogues as one of the conditions for doing
business with suppliers in its standard purchase agreement and demands suppliers comply with this condition

standard purchase agreements excerpts
demand on suppliers to respect human rights

the supplier shall not engage in forced or child labor illegal employment of foreign workers or other illegal or illegitimate
employment practices employment conditions including wages and shift lengths shall be based on the laws and
regulations of the respective countries and regions in which the supplier does business

training
we conduct training for all new permanent staff on our basic business philosophy and code of conduct this includes
training on compliance with local laws and a respect for basic human rights with emphasis on not employing persons
against their will and on compliance with local employment laws

recruitment
when recruiting employees panasonic adopts a perspective of protecting fundamental human rights and engages
in recruitment activities that comply with the laws and regulations of the respective countries in which we operate
panasonic also prohibits forced labour including child labour in order to prevent child labour we have included age
verification in the selfassessment checklist which is used when individuals join the company the risk of child labour
is thought to be especially high in china and elsewhere in asia and panasonic is implementing age verification in these
regions the company does not allow employees under the age of 18 to engage in overtime work and heavy labour and
offers them consideration and support so that they have opportunities to receive education

supplier csr meetings and csr selfassessments
we have been conducting csr meetings with our suppliers and conducting csr selfassessments the selfassessment
questionnaire fully covers issues related to modern slavery in fiscal 2017 we held supplier csr meetings in china and
asian countries where we circulated the selfassessment questionnaires to around 5000 suppliers where concern is
raised in the responses obtained further contact is made with some investigations conducted through site visits identified
risks are discussed with the supplier and panasonic assists in formulating a corrective action plan where required in fiscal
2017 we examined conditions on the ground at 12 of our suppliers we identified issues in areas such as human rights
health and safety and we requested that these issues be rectified

confidential whistleblowing
we protect whistle blowers by providing an anonymous whistleblowing hotline for employees employees are regularly
reminded of the whistleblowing hotline and are encouraged to use it if they suspect any potentially illegal behaviour or
practice


plans for the future and continuous improvement
we are aware that there are serious human rights and labourrelated risks in some part of the supply chains notably in high
risk areas with the complexity of the supply chains it takes time and effort to ensure all our suppliers are substantially free
from modern slavery we therefore endeavour to tackle modern slavery issues as a continuous process

we have expressed our commitment towards better understanding our supply chains and working towards greater
transparency and responsibility towards people working in them we will continue to work with our suppliers to encourage
commitment to and compliance with our csr policies and legislation we plan to act in accordance with the following over
the coming years
   supplier csr meetings and csr selfassessments  we will continue to conduct supplier csr meetings
    and csr selfassessments with our suppliers to help ensure compliance and evaluate their compliance with our
    csr policies this will allow us to assess how we can achieve continuous improvement in the coming years the self
    assessment questionnaire includes checking whether we are confirming ages in order to prevent child labour not

     allowing temporary agencies to collect fees or retain workers passports or identification documents and providing
     workers with employment contracts including terms of employment in those workers native languages panasonic
     recruits employees and accepts temporary workers based on the laws and regulations of the respective countries so
     that none of them are made to work against their will or are unduly subjected to disadvantageous working conditions
     we will continue to conduct supplier csr meetings and circulate the selfassessment questionnaires to suppliers in
     fiscal 2018 china asean countries europe us and central and south america are specifically planned for this work

   followup of the csr selfassessments  after receiving the selfassessment questionnaires from suppliers
    we analyse the results and if we find any points of concern we visit the suppliers on site for further investigation
    this includes questioning the suppliers in more detail to identify any underlying issues the process we now follow is
    based on advice we have received from a human rights and labour specialist as appropriate this results in an agreed
    corrective action plan being put into effect

   hotlines for workers employed by suppilers we are going to introduce hotlines for workers employed by
    suppliers in fiscal 2018 these new hotlines will be assisted by an external organization so that workers will feel more
    comfortable using it this hotline will first be introduced in malaysia

   employ an external information service  finding risks is the first step of tackling modern slavery issues
    however it is highly challenging for a large organisation with many suppliers like us to monitor all suppliers to overcome
    the difficulty panasonic corporation will start employing an external information service this will ensure that we are kept
    updated with human rights and labour information about our suppliers and take measures to address any issues

policy
to deliver products and services that contribute to the lives of customers around the world and to develop panasonics
business it is essential for the company to step up its efforts to develop human talent that can participate actively and
grow in the global business environment it is also essential that the company creates an organizational culture in which
all individual employees can fully deploy their talents regardless of age gender or nationality thus panasonic regards
the promotion of diversity as a crucial part of its business strategy and hence provides a broad range of opportunities for
anyone with ability and ambition and actively strives to create a workfriendly environment

in fiscal 2011 panasonic compiled this thinking into a global diversity policy since then this policy has been implemented
globally

   electronic business areas related to our daily lives with an aim to contribute to progress in society and to enrich
   peoples lives through manufacturing every employee plays a leading role in their job and promoting business

   panasonic is a collection of people with various backgrounds such as in terms of region culture and history who
   possess diverse capabilities as well as diverse traits in terms of various factors including gender age race belief
   religion nationality sexual orientation and gender identity each person has various different ideas and by sharing
   these ideas across countries and business areas we can create more innovative values thus panasonic will
   continue to be a group which always gathers wisdom and spurs innovation with the concerned efforts of all we have
   a strong hope that using our diverse mindsets and viewpoints we can deliver products and services like no other in
   the world to our customers

   in order to achieve this it is important to give a chance for success to motivated people of all countries and regions
   regardless of their gender nationality or any other characteristics we have expanded our diversity activities to make
   the best of the individuality and abilities of each employee and to support their success towards the group on a global
   basis we will continue to take up the challenge of becoming no1 in diversity promoting activities in each country
   and region

organization in charge of promoting diversity
in 1999 panasonic began its equal partnership initiative and since this time it has promoted the creation of an open
and fair work environmentone that does not discriminate based on gender age nationality or similar factorsthrough
initiatives such as the establishment of the panasonic positive action program special training programs for female
employees and the naming of equal employment opportunity officers

soon thereafter in 2001 efforts to appoint women to positions of responsibilitypreviously largely the purview of
the human resources departmentwere more forcefully recognized as drivers of diversity for the entire organization
accordingly as part of the management policies to change the corporate climate by facilitating the participation of women
in management the corporate equal partnership division was established directly under the office of the president

in 2006 the division was further developed as an organization and became the corporate diversity promotion division
with an expanded mandate that included a focus on diversity of age and nationality in addition to gender currently
engagement  diversity promotion office is established in the human resources  industrial relations department
endeavoring to create an organizational culture in which diversity thrives and supporting active participation by female
employees


performance evaluations
panasonic believes individuals and organizations that continue to evolve to be an engine of growth and that it is crucial
to combine the individual strength of each employeewho all are eager to work and to challenge themselvesin order to
fully realize the potential of the organization therefore panasonic believes it is essential to create an organization that is

employing workers post retirement
in 1982 panasonic created the senior partner system allowing workers past retirement age to enter into employment
contracts under new conditions in 2001 we introduced our next stage program renewing our position as an industry
leader in formulating policies for the employment of older workers in japan

the next stage program is a system that consists mainly of the next stage partner program which allows workers who
wish to continue working after mandatory retirement at age 60 to do so until age 65 in april 2008 we relaunched this as
the new next stage program our basic thinking here is an emphasis on personal autonomy the new system is easier to
understand more flexible and easier to use than ever before in 2015 we updated this system once again based on new
ideas of longerterm careers aimed at encouraging each employee to map out his or her own career from an early stage
our new system offers a broader range of measures to meet the diverse needs of older workers more specifically across
the entire company we are developing and promoting training seminars on career design and life design for various stages
of peoples lives as increasing numbers of people desire to continue working into their later years social attitudes are
changing this has economic ramifications in terms of retirement and pension benefitsspecifically the need for many
employees to continue to work during the gap between when they officially retire and when they start to receive pension
payoutsas well as ramifications in terms of the emergence of older workers as a potential resource we are striving to
ensure that everyone who wishes to continue working beyond the age of 60 has the opportunity to do so and we are fine
tuning the conditions of our next stage partner system to accommodate this change

                                                                           123

occupational health and safety

management system
the purpose of the panasonic groups occupational health and safety management is to promote a comfortable
safe workplace based on the most advanced and best practices its aim is to contribute to the welfare of the groups
employees and the development of panasonics business in addition the group has established in its regulations that it
will give careful consideration to the health and safety of the subcontractors employees who work fulltime on panasonic
premises

to maintain our efforts regarding occupational health and safetyand to improve them continuouslypanasonic has
implemented an occupational health and safety management system at nearly all its manufacturing locations globally some
of which are now under construction the systems implemented at company locations consist primarily of the panasonic
occupational safety and health management system which encompasses the ohsas18001 standard supplemented by
the companys unique perspective panasonic also acquires external ohsas18001 certification in locations outside japan
where it has been requested to do so by customers

panasonic uses this system to give all employees clear roles and responsibilities and to promote their engagement in
health and safetyrelated activities by setting clear targets the system also involves periodic reviews by the directors of
business sites thus allowing the company to revise these activities as needed panasonic periodicallyat least annually
conducts risk assessments to uncover any remaining risks of workplace accidents or illnesses and to reduce these risks
which it does decisively and in order of severity furthermore when a workplace accident happens within the company
panasonic shares it as a case study through its corporate intranet so that it can implement steps to prevent recurrences at
all business sites

at all business sites in japan health and safety committees composed of employees and managers investigate and
debate issues of health and safety that could affect employees moreover to achieve a similar level of protection for
employees of partner companies including contractors operating on our premises panasonic has established occupational
health and safety councils which are involved in a variety of activities including formulating occupational health and safety
policy as well as various forms of information sharing

panasonic group staff in charge of health and safety participate in an annual employee health and occupational health
and safety forum where together they study case studies of efforts at different business sites attend lectures by visiting
instructors and engage in other activities to increase their knowledge so they can put it into practice at each business site

in addition sites that have had no accidents for a certain period of time receive awards as do those that have initiated
activities relating to safety health or the promotion of healthy lifestyles among employees these initiatives can stand as
models of behavior for other sites in fiscal 2017 we worked to expand this program globally by for example announcing
praiseworthy cases from outside japan

initiatives relating to health issues
initiatives for preventing damage to health
with regard to the stress check system which became codified into law in december 2015 panasonic carries out checks
in conjunction with its regular health screenings and follows measures at each business site to ensure that all group
employees receive these checks results of stress checks are used to make employees aware of their stress levels and are
combined with feedback analyzing workplace conditions this information is used in measures to preempt mental health
issues by bringing vitality to workplaces

employees who work more hours or whose regular health screening results suggest a need for monitoring their safety
receive consultation based on panasonics own criteria from an occupational physician while measures are taken to
prevent damage to the employees health by addressing working conditions etc

furthermore under healthy panasonic 2018 which is run by the panasonic labor union the health insurance association
and panasonic corporation employees have taken part since 2011 in a ball toss game as a measure for promoting
better employee health when the company started promoting the game a decline in physical and muscular strength due
to aging had been identified as one cause of the sharp rise in occupational accidents from falls while walking or going
up or down stairs the ball game is a means for employees to become aware of their state of physical fitness and to
communicate more with one another since the game helps make personal exercise a habit and improves communication
in the workplace from 2015 we have held a companywide tournament with more than 32000 employees participating
annually

1 data in japan only

   ltd and sanyo electric co ltd from 2012
3 total time lost of victims due to labor accidents
4 proportion of time lost per 1000 hours of total working hours

at business sites where workplace accidents have occurred panasonic investigates the causes behind the incidents
implements measures to prevent recurrences and shares accident case studies groupwide so that all business sites may
implement preventive measures to avoid the same kinds of accidents themselves

to our deep regret one workplace death occurred in september 2016 when an employee was crushed by heavy
machinery panasonic takes this event extremely seriously the production engineering division and human resources
division worked together to immediately implement emergency inspections at business sites inside and outside japan in
order to prevent a recurrence while countermeasures have been enacted to address hazardous areas furthermore with
regard to the employee death that occurred at the toyama plant in june 2016 we solemnly accept the february 2017
official recognition of this as an occupational accident due to too many working hours and we are making efforts group
wide to prevent a recurrence

for special tasks such as handling heavy materials or chemical substances the company conducts work inspections
based on safety data sheet sdss and provides employees with appropriate personal protective equipment making
every effort to minimize the required amount of such work panasonic also reexamines the chemicals in question in
order to comply with the june 2016 compulsory regulations on chemical substance risk assessments additional health
screenings and monitoring for employees engaged in such work are also conducted to prevent negative impacts on health
in accordance with laws and regulations

protecting the global environment and information security panasonic concludes standard purchase agreements that
include csr requirements with the suppliers that it has confirmed fulfill its requirements

csr selfassessments of existing suppliers are also conducted as required by the results of evaluations panasonic
provides guidance or raises awareness with the aim of improving the situation

ensuring fair business
because panasonic believes that a company is a public entity of society it engages in fair transactions with its global
suppliers there is a need for a more stringent sense of moderation and ethics in relationships with suppliers in 2004
panasonic made the clean procurement declaration and since then has followed a code of conduct in its procurement
activities regretfully in fiscal 2017 there were cases of employees working in procurement for panasonic in china who
violated these principles panasonic considers this a serious issue to prevent a reoccurrence panasonic has instituted
thorough measures to remind all employees in charge of procurement of their responsibilities

 prohibition of receiving money valuables and anything else that is improper from suppliers prohibition of
  benefiting in the form of hospitality entertainment or meals
  panasonic has established rules on entertainment and gifts from suppliers which lays out strict rules that prohibit
  receiving any entertainment or meals money goods or property obtaining any advantages or receiving other payoffs
  from any business partners from which panasonic purchases goods or obtains services or who may become such
  business partners these rules also both encourage reporting to or consultation with superiors in the workplace hr or
  legal departments or the internal hotline established for when a violation has been discovered and lay out disciplinary
  actions for those who violate these rules

 establishing of a purchasing ombudsperson fair business hotline
  panasonic promotes fair and equal procurement activities based on our clean procurement declaration
  we have created the fair business hotline a fair and objective organization as a means for reporting in the event that
  any of our procurement staff have violated any laws or regulations agreements with suppliers the panasonic code of
  conduct or other procurement rules or is suspected to be about to do so in the near future

responsible supply chain enforcement of csr for suppliers

enforcement of the panasonic supply chain csr promotion guidelines
in march 2016 the panasonic group issued the csr requirements we have created in order to convey our stance on csr
procurement that we want our suppliers to adhere to known as the panasonic supply chain csr promotion guidelines
hereafter procurement guidelines with reference to international standards and standard approaches in industry

these procurement guidelines have been created in japanese english chinese thai vietnamese and indonesian and
we are working on distributing them to all our suppliers via email and ensuring that they have been notified in addition to
posting them on our website

requests to our suppliers for csr selfassessments
in fiscal 2016 we began requesting that our suppliers begin conducting csr selfassessments concerning the state of
their initiatives related to human rights health and safety the environment and ethics

in fiscal 2017 we requested csr selfassessments from roughly 5000 suppliers mostly in china southeast asia and
india

based on the selfassessments we visit suppliers check conditions on the ground and hold interviews whenever
necessary in fiscal 2017 we checked conditions on the ground at 12 suppliers we identified three issues in areas such as
human rights health and safety and we requested that corrections be made we will continue to request selfassessments
of our suppliers and to communicate with them about csr we will work to take swift corrective action in the event that we
find any issues and to build up a solid healthy supply chain

responsible supply chain response regarding conflict minerals

basic stance on conflict minerals
the issues of conflict minerals are considered important by panasonic these minerals are mined in the democratic
republic of congo drc and neighboring countries hereinafter the covered countries and their extraction funds
organizations that violate human rights cause serious harm to the environment perpetrate corruption and are otherwise
involved in illegal activity

to fulfill our social responsibilities in our procurement activities our policy prohibits the usage of illegally obtained conflict
minerals as raw materials

in the rare event that such use is discovered efforts aimed at to terminate any usage must be made without delay

to this end a notice was issued in december 2010 to the entire group requiring a thorough approach to nonuse in
february 2011 efforts began to require checks of our major suppliers sources for procuring minerals

however in the covered countries there are also companies and individuals engaged in legal business activities with
no connection to any illegal activities we also must strive hard to ensure that such companies or individuals business
activities and livelihoods are not harmed by our efforts to avoid using minerals that are illegally obtained

to this end we need to cooperate with a wide range of stakeholders including countries companies and nonprofit
organizations npos that are taking measures to build fair supply chains of minerals in the covered countries based on
these concepts panasonic has been participating in the organisation for economic cooperation and developments oecd
due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas which
began in august 2011

alongside our involvement in this project we are also engaged in other efforts aimed at the implementation of the oecd
guidance building management processes that conform to global standards with the aim of contributing to international
efforts to resolve the problem of conflict minerals

panasonics systems for dealing with conflict minerals
panasonic is making efforts to build companywide systems with ultimate responsibility residing with the executive officer
in charge of procurement with the start of the fourcompany system in april 2013 we designated a person at each
company to be in charge of investigating and reporting on conflict minerals under the aegis of these individuals each
company is making efforts to build systems and carry out investigations based on the characteristics of its own business


due diligence efforts
in addition to communicating panasonics policies to our suppliers we also ask them to put reasonable efforts toward
being drc conflict free and procure materials from conflictfree smelters cfs to the extent possible

investigations of conflict minerals require the cooperation of all suppliers and all the refiners  smelters they work with
to reduce the burden on suppliers and to enhance the efficiency of such investigations we have found it effective to
use common investigating tools and explanatory materials based on this realization panasonic uses as an investigative
tool the conflict minerals reporting template cmrt issued by the conflictfree sourcing initiative cfsi we are also
active participants at investigative briefings held by jeitas japan electronics and information technology industries
association responsible minerals trade working group where we work as a presenter we make active use of manuals
and other handbooks jointly prepared by japanese automobile makers and the japan auto parts industries association for
conducting investigations

status of investigations
in fiscal 2017 the panasonic group as a whole surveyed around 1800 supplier companies on conflict materials and had
responses from 95 of those as of the end of january 2017 based on the cmrts that we have collected we have
already conducted a risk analysis and assessment and have requested further investigations from suppliers according to
risks

a total of 313 smelters have been identified by the panasonic group for the four specified minerals

at the present time we have not confirmed any minerals that have served to finance military power either directly or
indirectly for the metals that have been reported in the survey as being sourced from covered countries but we will
continue our work of closely examining and identifying smelter information

furthermore through our industry activities we have urged smelters to acquire cfs certification our suppliers continue to
perform due diligence but in the rare event minerals are discovered to have been supportive of conflict we are asking that
these suppliers strive to change their suppliers or take other steps toward nonuse


participation in forums on implementing due diligence for responsible
mineral supply chains
beginning in 2011 panasonic has been participating in oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains
of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas projects currently the forum on responsible mineral supply
chains at the forum in november 2013 we learned about ongoing efforts toward conflictfree minerals procurement
including mines exchanges and traceability systems for responsible minerals procurement in rwanda and ways to
identify mines through analysis of mineral composition and generation we also participated in the forum in paris in may
2015 where we were able to exchange views with other interested persons and learn about effective approaches to the
problem of conflict minerals


industry cooperation initiatives
investigations of conflict minerals require the cooperation of all suppliers in the supply chain accordingly panasonic has
been working with jeita japan electronics and information technology industries association as cochair and coleader
of the responsible minerals trade working group engaging in educational activities and efforts to make the investigative
process more efficient through industry cooperation

more specifically we have been working with industry groups both inside and outside japan and holding seminars and
briefings about investigations to promote correct efforts regarding conflict minerals we have checked information on
smelters  refiners and helped plan the ipc1755 standards for the sharing of us data on conflict minerals in november
2013 jeitas responsible minerals trade working group teamed up with japanese automakers to create the conflict
free sourcing working group in order to engage in dialog with the smelting industry and to accelerate efforts to verify
information about smelters  refiners panasonic was also a participant in this activity

since january 2016 along with other corporate members of jeitas responsible minerals trade working group we have
begun working toward getting smelters that have not yet received cfs certification to do so

we have also visited smelters in japan and conducted information exchanges on the conditions and issues surrounding
conflict minerals and have considered what sensible ways of dealing with conflict minerals should look like


support for efforts in democratic republic of congo and neighboring countries
panasonic has engaged in due diligence initiatives to fulfill its social responsibilities as a downstream company but we
think the most important development towards resolving the problem of conflict minerals would be the establishment of
mechanisms for responsible procurement of minerals in the covered countries

based on this thinking we participated with industry groups the us government and citizen groups in the publicprivate
alliance for responsible minerals trade ppa from march 2013 to august 2017

the ppa supports efforts to create mechanisms and develop capabilities for certification and traceability of minerals
transactions that are unrelated to any conflict in the africas great lakes region at the same time it creates a platform for
