             there are numerous changes people could make to eat a more ideal diet
             however the one simple thing the majority of us can do to become

 eating a little less really adds up
 research shows that for people who are overweight or obese a very modest reduction in calories  just five
 percent or about 100 calories per day  would lead to a national savings of 58 billion per year in medical
 expenditures due to a reduced prevalence of heart disease diabetes cancer and other health conditions this cost
 savings is 10 times greater than the savings predicted from reducing sodium or saturated fat intake by 30 percent

our focus areas
dietary variety
eating a variety of foods from each of the food groups is one of the fundamental principles of eating well nutrition
research shows that many people come up a little short when it comes to certain foods for example compared to
recommended intakes adults eat only about onefifth of the amount of whole grains onehalf of the amount of
beans and twothirds of the amount of vegetables they should conagra foods makes more than 450 different
varieties and sizes of foods across our branded and privatebrand portfolios to help consumers enjoy a
more varied diet




singleserve meals help with weight management
for those of us who are watching our weight eating rightsized portions is a key factor for success nutrition research
shows that people who eat frozen singleserve meals as part of their overall weight management plan lose more
weight and keep it off longer than those who solely rely on cooking weighing and measuring out meals they make in
their own kitchens14 the reason is simple  frozen singleserve meals make it easier to practice portion control
with more than 160 different singleserve meals from healthy choice marie callenders banquet bertolli
rosarita and kid cuisine at 450 or fewer calories conagra foods gives you plenty of options and variety to choose
from when you want to eat rightsized portions

our food
the egg beaters surprise
historically consumers have often turned to egg beaters as a hearthealthy option because it provides lower
saturated fat and cholesterol than shelled eggs what some consumers dont know however is that calorie for
calorie egg beaters have more than twice the protein and three times the volume of shelled eggs we wanted to
explore the benefits of this difference so we asked a group of consumers to eat each of two breakfasts one
breakfast contained a 140calorie portion of shelled eggs about 2 shelled eggs and the other a 140calorie portion
of egg beaters 12 cups here is what we found

   participants felt more full and had less desire to eat for at least three hours after eating the egg beaters breakfast
    compared to the shelled eggs breakfast
   when they ate lunch participants ate on average 80 fewer calories after the egg beaters breakfast compared to
    the shelled eggs breakfast
   taste tests of the breakfasts showed that consumers liked the egg beaters as well as the shelled eggs

these results show that eating fewer calories doesnt have to mean hunger and sacrifice in fact just the opposite
by eating a filling and satisfying breakfast with egg beaters providing more than twice the protein and portion size
of shelled eggs consumers naturally ate less at lunch

                    this research highlights a hidden benefit of egg beaters which are made
                    of real eggs egg beaters still offer all of their heart healthy benefitsbut
                    as this research demonstrates they are also a filling proteinrich low
                    calorie choice that can make it easier to eat less while feeling full and
                    satisfied

suppliers  ingredients
enhancing safety  quality through strategic sourcing
conagra foods believes that collaborative relationships with our strategic suppliers make our business stronger
together we are working diligently to enhance the consumer experience increase collaboration on food safety
initiatives and increase visibility on emerging industry issues these partnerships not only help take our own food
safety programs to the next level but also enhance food safety throughout our supply chain while positively
impacting the industry as a whole




our comprehensive supplier quality program is an integral part of our procurement strategy we only buy and use
ingredients that comply with the appropriate regulatory requirements for food safety in addition to our internal audit
team we use registered certification agencies to audit our suppliers facilities on an annual basis using global food
safety initiative gfsi standards

for any issue identified during an audit we follow up by approving and confirming implementation of corrective
actions our internal audit team conducted 273 total audits of which 126 were supplier audits



allergen and sensitive ingredient management
a key component of our food safety program is carefully managing major food allergens throughout our supply chain
and in our own facilities our allergen program promotes best practices designed to prevent crosscontact and to
ensure that the presence of food allergens in a food is communicated clearly to consumers in fact our allergen
management program predates the passage of the food allergen labeling and consumer protection act falcpa in
2004

our branded foods that contain allergens include a contains statement located below the ingredient statement
this statement will use plain language to disclose any of the top eight food allergens contained in the food we
recommend consumers with food allergies always check the ingredient statement each time they purchase one of
our foods because product formulations may change




                                                                                conagra foods 2014 citizenship report

although we prefer to give consumers clear guidance some of our food packages may feature a precautionary
may contain statement we always use good manufacturing practices gmps and thoroughly clean our
equipment after using allergencontaining ingredients in some cases however our best efforts may not be
sufficient due to the nature of the equipment or process if one of our foods features a may contain
statement we recommend that people allergic to the foods listed not consume the product

on august 5 2014 the fdas final rule for glutenfree foods took effect all foods bearing a gluten free
claim must assure they contain less than 20 ppm parts per million gluten conagra foods has some foods
that bear this claim they only do so however after meeting the requirements of a comprehensive program
that reviews the ingredients verifies the suitability of the facility and incorporates appropriate testing to
assure that all of our foods bearing glutenfree claims are in full compliance with the rule




                                                                            conagra foods 2014 citizenship report

genetic modification
conagra foods agrees with the us food and drug administration fda and numerous trusted scientific bodies
and regulatory agencies world health organization food and agriculture organization of the united nations
organization for economic cooperation and development that foods and beverages that contain genetic
modification gm of ingredients are safe and nutritious to eat given the potential for gm to improve the quality
sustainable availability and nutritional value of food we support its responsible use when based on sound science
and regulatory and safety reviews

what is gm
gm is different from traditional plant breeding gm means adding specific desirable traits from one plant or
microorganism to a food plant it is not about inserting chemicals into foods examples of gm efforts include those
designed to allow crops to use less water or be grown on less land or to be more resistant to weeds and pests

is it new
gm has been around for the past 20 years today food that has been genetically modified is found in markets
throughout the grocery store and on restaurant menus the grocery manufacturers association has reported that
at least 70 percent to 80 percent of the foods we eat in the united states contain genetically modified ingredients

what is conagra foods doing
we understand that gm is an area of evolving public perception and opinion and as a corporate citizen we
evaluate the impacts of our decisions on a wide range of constituents as a result conagra foods is working
crossfunctionally both internally and externally to ensure company decisions are consistent with regulations and
credible science and informed by emerging thought our employees  from scientists to supply chain experts to
consumer insight professionals  are engaging with key trade associations farmers rd organizations nonprofits
consumers customers and socially conscious investor groups to inform our thinking we also discuss this issue
with our scientific advisory board and food safety council external groups of thought leaders in the fields of
medicine nutrition food science and behavior science we stay abreast of potential legislation and will always

                                                                                                            39

consider support of laws that are in the consumer and societal interest we believe consumers should be
knowledgeable about whats in their food and our consumer affairs team is happy to provide information on
biotechnology use in our food

conagra foods is continuing to work in collaboration with our industry peers on a longerterm approach to provide
further transparency for consumers regarding the use of gm ingredients in food conagra foods would be
supportive of federal guidelines for a uniform approach in this area conagra foods does not support mandatory
labeling on a state by state basis as this presents significant complication and costs  costs the consumer may
share conagra foods is committed to meeting our consumers expectations and contributing to a safe nutritious
sustainable and affordable food supply for now and the foreseeable future



faqs
is it safe to eat your food if it includes ingredients produced using biotechnology also referred to as
biotech genetically modified organisms or gmo
yes both the us environmental protection agency and the fda have concluded that biotech food that is
approved for human consumption is as safe and nutritious as food that is developed through more conventional
methodsthroughout the past two decades biotechnology has been used to improve yield nutrition resistance to
drought and insects and other desirable qualities of several common food crops including corn and soy at
conagra foods we only purchase and use ingredients that comply with us department of agriculture and food

interacting with the nutrition community
conagra foods uses nutrition research to understand how our foods fit within a healthy lifestyle this information is
shared with researchers and other professionals in the nutrition community through publications and presentations
at scientific meetings in fy14 we shared the following research results
    replacing a typical lunch with a single serving frozen meal helps dieters reduce more calories than when they
     replace lunch with a shake
    people spontaneously consume fewer calories while watching tv and snacking when they eat from large bowls of
     lowfat popcorn instead of potato chips
    calorie for calorie egg whites are more satiating than whole eggs egg whites offer more than twice the protein
     and almost three times the portion size of whole eggs at the same calorie level
    the positive change in serum lycopene seen after individuals increase their tomato intake to
     myplaterecommended amounts is similar to the upward shift in serum lycopene that is related to reduced
     cardiovascular disease risk in population studies

 in addition to our own research we continue to provide unrestricted support to several academic institutions to
 foster the advancement in understanding of nutrition issues in fy14 we supported the following institutions and

nutrition labeling
we follow both us food  drug administration fda and us
department of agriculture usda regulations requiring
standardized declaration of nutrients consumers interested in
knowing the content of calories fat saturated fat transfat
sodium sugars fiber protein carbohydrates and several
vitamins and minerals per serving can easily access this
information in the nutrition facts box which is typically found on
the back or side of food packages a compliance program
ensures ongoing accuracy of our nutrition information which is
also posted and updated annually on our company websites

 in addition to the nutrition facts box we have joined an industrywide effort with the grocery manufacturers of
 america and food marketing institute to develop a common approach to nutrition labeling called facts up front  a
 fact based system which displays standardized icons for calories sodium saturated fat and sugars per serving of
 food on the front of food packages we began implementing this iconography in fy12 and continued to add it to
 the front of packages in fy13 and fy14 to learn more about facts up front visit wwwfactsupfrontorg

investigated to help ensure that appropriate actions are taken and lessons are identified to prevent similar incidents
from happening again

the challenge of conducting onsite preventive screenings rather than hiring an outside agency come in and screen
employees  and the response has been encouraging one nurse said i can attest that having the nurses do these
screenings is crucial almost imperative to changing the wellness culture within our organization the employees had
access to several counseling points during the process all of which were used to build trust and rapport with
employees and ensure that they had the support and guidance they needed on their journey toward living healthier
lives

                                                       means not only does the food bank for the heartland have to
                                                       offer a wide range of food options to assist clients with their

                                                       growing demand for key items




with the food bank providing services to a rather large geography it is no surprise that meat is their most
popular and expensive item the food bank works hard annually to reach as many people as possible with food
assistance however limited freezer capacity and low inventory turnovers were making it challenging to meet food
demands especially for meat products recognizing the need for a closer look at how the food bank currently
processes meats through its warehouse conagra foods performance system team offered to facilitate a process
improvement session to help the food bank identify ways to improve planning and streamline the handling
process

a team of leaders from the food bank of the heartland st martin detorres
heart ministry center heartland hope mission and project hope were
gathered to leverage a business method called valuestream mapping
where the current state of a series of activities for a product or service is
analyzed to design a future state that will enhance the process from the
beginning through to the customer or in this case families in nebraska and
iowa working closely with dave love director of distribution for food bank
for the heartland two conagra foods employees craig andrews lean
supply chain director and ken ng lean supply chain specialist dedicated
more than 32 hours to help guide the team through the mapping process
and generate a set of recommendations and improvement

training and growing future leaders through the national food bank
network
as part of the conagra foods foundations 10million commitment to feeding america 25 million is dedicated to supporting the
growth and expansion of the conagra foods child hunger corps program this customdesigned initiative provides a twoyear
placement for budding leaders who have the enthusiasm to advance the child hunger agenda across feeding americas national food
bank network the main objective of the program is to increase the number of nutritious snacks and meals served to children in need in
communities across the country at the outset feeding americas goal was to have more than 30 corps members placed in food banks
over a fiveyear period ending in 2015 to date 32 corps members have been placed in food banks in more than 20 states from
california to maine




                                                                                           conagra foods 2014 citizenship report

according to the child hunger corps midprogram evaluation members from cohort 1 and 2 have had a lasting
impact on their host food banks key results include

   the number of meals and snacks served to children increased significantly at host food banks where a corps member was placed
    cohort 1 and 2 increased meals on average by more than 92 percent in comparison to food banks without a corp member
   host food banks with corps members had a significant increase in the number of meals served to children during summer months
    cohort 1 and 2 were able to sustain an average increase of summer meals by 50 percent
   hosting a corps member allowed food banks to increase their visibility in their communities and gave partners a designated child
    hunger point person corps members are considered an important asset to help the food bank to increase community relationships
    with churches schools universities and other institutions increase representation in community initiatives and increase
    communication between the food bank and other organizations working on child hunger locally
   child hunger corps members contributed to their food banks beyond child hunger programming including grant writing data
    management and tracking fundraising and more

hosting a child hunger corps member has allowed us to do something weve needed to for a long time
 fully assess where we need to direct our programs and determine what barriers we would need to
overcome to do so this information will define our goals for childrens programs for the next 510
years

summer fun  a corps member reflection on making a difference
since my first week at the foodbank of santa barbara county i have spent countless hours researching best
practices and planning our summer lunch program picnic in the park my community needs assessment centered
around picnic in the park and since completing the cna i have been working each day to coordinate the best
possible summer lunch program as any big project does planning for the summer has had its ups and downs while
we expanded four new sites in a town with extremely high child poverty we have dealt with sites in other areas of
the county backing down from participating despite the challenges that we have faced in recent months we are
moving forward and distributing more lunches in more high need areas than ever before and children and families
are returning to our program in greater numbers


seeing three hundred children at one neighborhood park excited to be physically active and play organized games
and then receive a healthy lunch that they enjoy with friends in the summer sun is more than anyone could ask for
as an outcome of months of hard work

                                  case study


as we scanned the universe looking for the best nutrition education program in which to invest we asked
ourselves what does good nutrition education look like many programs support and align with the usdas dietary
guidelines for americans and the myplate tool yet despite the increased public awareness of the vital role that
food choices dietary practices and physical activity have on health behaviors are not consistent with the dietary
guidelines for americans

working in partnership with our inhouse nutrition team we went to the experts in nutrition  the academy of
nutrition and dietetics and  and asked for help in defining what good nutrition education looks like and in
creating a tool for the community at large

through a grant from the conagra foods foundation to the and foundation we supported a fellow who culled
the relevant research validated the evidence basedinterventions with experts in the field on the front line and
created a tool called the guide for effective nutrition interventions and education genie genie is a firstofits
kind simple practical and evidencebased tool to help nutrition education practitioners design highquality and
effective programs genie can help program planners design and build effective nutrition education programs with
a higher likelihood of achieving outcomes program reviewers can leverage genie to efficiently compare various
nutrition education program proposals and inform funding decisions

one frac goal is to enroll more eligible lowincome children in federal nutrition programs including school breakfast
summer food afterschool food and the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children
wic these programs are key to ensure children get the food they need to live healthful lives however the
program participation levels vary statetostate children are most vulnerable to hunger when they are out of school
for example more than 20 million children participate in the free or reducedlunch program yet in july 2013 three
million children participated in the summer nutrition programs this is an increase of 161000 children or 57
percent from july 2012 this growth was the largest percentage increase in the number of lowincome children
eating summer meals in more than a decade

coordination of services are essential to achieve these milestones
and has been working with frac to develop a yearround outreach
training and technical assistance project to engage key national
organizations in the adoption and use of the federal child nutrition
programs

environmental management 
compliance
as outlined in our global environment occupational health and safety philosophy statement signed by ceo gary
rodkin in 2009 conagra foods is dedicated to making the food people love in an environmentally responsible way
to further demonstrate our commitment to complying with environmental laws and regulations and to protecting
natural resources we recently released five new ehs policies environmental policy compliance climate change
water stewardship and resource conservation compliance with federal state and local environmental laws and
regulations provides the foundation for our sustainability programs through the implementation of a robust
environmental management system we proactively manage environmental issues and share best practices among
our facilities around the world furthermore environmental compliance is routinely assessed through internal
environmental audits when compliance issues arise our team of environmental professionals works closely with the
affected facility to educate and develop effective action plans and track findings to resolution

in fy14 conagra foods received 36 notices of violation novs and paid a total of 1109500 in environmental fines
the nov total includes the facilities previously owned by ralcorp holdings the amount of environmental fines paid
for novs received in fy14 was 9500 the remaining 1100000 was for 2 historic issues that occurred in 2007 and
2009 approximately half of the novs were issued due to exceeding wastewater parameters the remaining novs
primarily resulted from air permitting and storm water deficiencies

our climate strategy
climate change remains one of our most significant environmental challenges impacting our agricultural supply
base potentially threatening our water supply and fundamentally altering growing regions as we now know them
we are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions within our own operations and throughout our supply chain
to mitigate these risks and build a business that is resilient to climate change

our greenhouse gas management program is founded on an understanding of facilityspecific emission sources to
enable strategic decisions regarding reduction opportunities these decisions are enabled by data with many of our
locations tracking greenhouse gas emission per pound of production on a daily or weekly basis furthermore we
believe that accountability for making yearoveryear improvements is integral to achieving our 20 percent
greenhouse gas reduction goal by 2020

because about 96 percent of conagra foods greenhouse gas emissions result from natural gas and electricity use
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy efficiency are essentially one and the same we believe
rather than purchase carbon offsets it is most impactful and cost effective to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions
through energy efficiency consistent with this approach we did not purchase carbon offsets in fy14

greenhouse gas inventory
scope 1  2 emissions
conagra foods is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent per pound of production by 2020
with a diverse portfolio of food  ranging from canned tomatoes to frozen potatoes to popcorn  were mindful that
each type of product requires different energy inputs resulting in varying carbon intensities were leveraging this
knowledge to further refine our greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy targeting those products and
processes that are most energyintensive

in fy14 our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions were about 21 million metric tons our total scope 1 and 2
emissions have decreased by 53 percent since fy08 our greenhouse gas intensity  or emissions per ton of
product produced  has remained relatively flat decreasing by about 13 percent since fy08 about 96 percent of
our greenhouse gas emissions come from our use of natural gas and electricity




to drive progress toward our greenhouse gas reduction goal we have begun to include business unit greenhouse
gas reduction targets in performance appraisals for leadership at both corporate and plant levels this initiative is
based on sitespecific yearoveryear greenhouse gas reduction goals in support of this many of our facilities
integrate greenhouse gas reduction strategies into the annual site master planning process it is management
processes like these that are increasing accountability throughout our organization while driving greater employee
awareness and engagement

greenhouse gas inventory
scope 3 emissions
conagra foods also reports on select scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions where
   data are reasonably available
   emission factors are accurate and based on sound science
   the value and insights gained from the information outweigh the costs of gathering the data

weve included detailed information in this report about the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of
contracted upstream transportation and distribution to ship finished food from our manufacturing facilities to our
customers this is the second year that conagra foods reported scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions associated with
solid waste management practices using the environmental protection agencys waste reduction model warm
using facilityspecific solid waste disposal and diversion data in more than 15 different material types warm
provides insight to the greenhouse gas emissions reductions associated with diverting solid waste from landfills


upstream transportation  distribution
farmtofork transportation and storage of raw materials ingredients and finished products contribute to the total life
cycle environmental footprint of our food our reported transportation data include those that conagra foods influences
directly either by contracting with carriers or by using fleet vehicles we own or lease this primarily includes
transportation used to move finished products to customers distribution centers though there are some exceptions
when we manage the transportation of raw ingredients more than 97 percent of our transportation is contracted and
the emissions of those vehicles is categorized as scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the world
resources institute and the world business council for sustainable development greenhouse gas protocol

we are working aggressively with our transportation business partners distributors and customers to improve
transportation efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions we rely on a variety of contracted transportation
services including rail cars intermodal trucks and ocean freighters to meet the inbound and outbound transportation
requirements for our food in addition conagra foods jm swank distribution business owns and operates a private
fleet and contracts with many thirdparty carriers to service other segments of the food processing industry whether
contracted or owned conagra foods is focused on improving the efficiency of every mode of transportation it uses

                                                conagra foods comprehensive sustainable transportation strategy
                                                focuses on improving efficiency in three ways first we are continuously
                                                improving pallet efficiency by optimizing package size and orientation to
                                                fit the most products on each shipment second we evaluate available
                                                modes of transportation and seek to use the most efficient method for
                                                example  though still a small part of our transportation footprint  weve
                                                increased the amount of product moved using intermodal transportation
                                                by more than 40 percent compared to fy08 lastly our contracted
                                                carriers are continually upgrading their fleets to improve efficiency
                                                including trucks equipped with batterypowered auxiliary systems and

energy use  efficiency
about 96 percent of our scope 1  2 greenhouse gas emissions result from our use of natural gas and electricity
therefore we track these metrics at the facility level on a monthly basis and provide quarterly reports to
management sharing progress toward our greenhouse gas reduction goal many of our locations also track these
metrics on a daily or weekly basis making energy use a key performance indicator for daily operations

between fy08 and fy14 we decreased our total electricity use by 24 percent and natural gas use by 39
percent our energy intensity  or energy use per pound of product produced  remained flat for natural gas and
increased for electricity 17 percent to further drive accountability in improving energy efficiency weve added
sitespecific reduction goals to the performance expectations of senior leadership and managers throughout the
company

water use
we understand the importance of protecting one of the planets most critical
resources  water our suppliers and contracted growers depend on the
availability of clean water to grow crops and produce the raw materials
needed for making our food our own facilities rely on access to clean water to
operate prepare food on a commercial scale and ensure that our equipment
meets or exceeds food safety and quality standards as a result our water
resource strategy guides how we actively manage water resources across the
value chain and factors in both water use and water quality




in fy14 conagra foods decreased its total water use by 110 percent compared to fy08 our water intensity  the
water we use per pound of production  also decreased by 73 percent during this same period perhaps most
promising is that weve reduced water use per pound by 50 percent compared to last year showing that our
conservation efforts are producing tangible results

about 40 percent of the water we use in our facilities is recycled and used for
irrigation at neighboring farms returning a significant portion of the water to
beneficial agricultural use


how we use water to make food
reducing the amount of water we use is just as important as paying attention to the quality of water we discharge to
local communities we withdraw water from three sources municipal systems onsite wells and adjacent surface
water bodies similarly we discharge wastewater in three ways to publicly owned treatment facilities as land
application or irrigation and directly to surface water bodies

conagra foods makes a variety of food products each of which requires a different amount of water to prepare
though there are many similarities in the ways we use water eg for producing steam for cooking for cleaning to
ensure food quality etc there are fundamental differences in how much water is needed for various products
understanding the watertofood ratio for our products translates into plantspecific conservation projects that work
to increase efficient water use in our manufacturing processes and sanitation procedures enabling us to better
prioritize conservation efforts across our company

committed to conservation our poppycock and crunch n munch facility in lincoln neb challenged the weekly
wet wash cleaning cycle to reduce water used during sanitation cleaning results were validated to allow the
process to be extended to a 21day cycle internal and external sanitation experts tested daily micro levels and
sanitation results before the project and after the project was implemented for 150 days extending the wet wash
cleaning cycle has not only improved micro cleaning results and employee safety but these efforts conserved
650000 gallons reducing water use by 47 percent

our water meter must be broken
our frozen foods facility in macon mo developed a system to utilize grey water in their wastewater treatment
process after measuring the amount of heated potable water used to clean the wastewater rotary screens they
further analyzed the necessary temperature required to effectively remove the fat and grease leveraging this
insight the team identified an alternate source of warm water to reduce fresh water use and heating requirements
macon installed a pump off their secondary dissolved air flotation daf unit which now reuses 4 million gallons
of warm water previously destined for the city sewer back into the wastewater treatment process to clean the
rotary screens

water risk
waterrelated risks can be particularly threatening to the food industry with a global supply chain intensely
dependent on the availability of clean water to grow ingredients managing water risk  both at our own facilities
and those embedded in our supply chain  is critical to conagra foods longterm business success




the extremes in water crisis over the past several years have demonstrated how water is indeed a critical local issue
with potential for global consequences historic flooding of the missouri and mississippi rivers in the central united
states in 2011 was followed by recordsetting droughts the following year in fields that were completely washed out
by flooding just a year prior cornstalks struggled to grow turning brown due to the lack of water at the close of
fy14 we faced one of the most severe droughts on record in the state of california where 95 percent of the
tomatoes in the united states are grown including those used in hunts ketchup and other conagra foods products
these realities prove that managing water risk is an integral part of business planning


conagra foods has responded to the cdp water disclosure project since its inception
the project provides information to the global marketplace on investment risks and
opportunities associated with water risk our responses are publicly available on the
cdps website



direct water risk exposure
in fy11 using the global water tool developed by the world business council for sustainable development
wbcsd we first began mapping each conagra foods facility against areas of watershed stress and incoming water
flow and quality this year we transitioned to the world resources institutes aqueduct water risk atlas and for the
first time extended our analysis to include our new locations added through the ralcorp acquisition overall water
risk results from the tool show 7 percent of our facilities as low risk 41 percent as low to medium risk 41 percent as
medium to high risk and 11 percent as high risk these 10 high risk locations represent just 33 percent of conagra
foods total annual water use

despite the fact that the majority of our facilities are located in areas of low to medium water risk effectively
managing water resources  both in terms of water use efficiency and wastewater discharge quality  is one of our
top sustainability priorities in the years ahead we plan to take our analysis beyond the aqueduct water risk atlas
and leverage knowledge of local watersheds and regulatory environments to better understand our risk exposure

                                                                                 conagra foods 2014 citizenship report

    bridge over troubled water
    our lamb weston potato processing facility in richland wash irrigates 277 acres of nearby farmland as part of
    their wastewater treatment process due to fluctuations in the amount of water discharged by the facility
    additional potable city water was used as needed to sustain healthy crops to conserve potable city water the
    richland team worked with the city to install approximately 8000 feet of distribution piping to gain access to
    unused irrigation water this collaborative thinking resulted in 82 million gallons of potable water
    conserved annually for more beneficial use

                                                                                                            conagra foods 2014 citizenship report

journey to zero waste
2020 vision eliminating waste and keeping it out of landfills
    reduce waste generated in our facilities by one billion pounds
    continue our zero wastetolandfill journey while focusing on directing materials to the most beneficial use
    lead the industry in packaging for sustainable systems with continuous improvement of design and expertise in the
     role packaging plays in preventing food waste learn more

solid waste is simply the result of the inefficient use of resources representing an opportunity for our
operations to manage those resources more effectively our continuous improvement program  based on a
zero loss philosophy  drives maximum use of our material resources nearly all solid waste generated at
our manufacturing facilities consists of food and packaging materials much of which should really be more
aptly characterized as byproduct instead of waste by reframing the way we talk about these materials we
can begin changing attitudes and behaviors in our facilities to make even greater gains in our waste reduction
efforts
our goals for 2020 are to systematically and strategically reduce our wastes generated and keep materials
out of the landfill so that we can maximize the use of our resources for the future we are very proud of the
work that has been done to keep materials out of landfills in fy14 more than 94 percent of solid waste
generated from our facilities was diverted to more beneficial use through recycling donations to feed people
use as animal feed energy generation or land applications as a soil amendment
at the same time weve turned our focus to reducing and eliminating wastes at the source taking notable
strides toward our goal of avoiding one billion pounds of waste by 2020 by reducing total waste generated
through improved material utilization and source reduction we have avoided 261158000 pounds of waste
compared to fy11 achieving 26 percent of this goal in the years ahead conagra foods remains committed
to our zero wastetolandfill journey and keeping valuable materials out of landfills

reaching a major milestone in the zero wastetolandfill journey
thirtythree of conagra foods facilities representing more than 80 percent of total waste generation send less
than 5 percent of the waste they generate to landfills these facilities are recognized with zero waste
champion awards for each year they achieve a 95 or greater diversion rate to reinforce this journey several
facilities have achieved a true zero waste to landfill where all of their material is sent to a beneficial reuse

eliminating food waste
getting the most of our natural resources is a fundamental goal of conagra foods to that end we are working hard
to identify sources of waste throughout our facilities and practices and seeking out ways to reduce that waste at the
source reducing waste through improved yields first pass quality strategic production initiatives and better design
is smart business its good for the environment and the bottom line

food waste comprises a large portion of the solid waste generated at our production facilities it results from yield
losses within our processes products that did not meet our high quality standards and unused ingredients because
organic materials degrade in landfills and generate methane a potent greenhouse gas keeping these materials out
of landfills is a core component of our waste and climate strategies aligned with the principles of the environmental
protection agencys food waste recovery hierarchy conagra foods strives to redirect food waste to its most
beneficial use

how important is our packaging in addition to delivering safe greattasting food to consumers it provides
nutritional information preparation instructions and in many cases convenience and portion control packaging
shape and design helps identify our brands making them easier for consumers to find in stores and enhancing the
overall experience with our food packaging preserves freshness extends shelf life and provides important protection
to help avoid food waste from spoilage or damage with so many food options and formats offered across different
sections of the store we use a large variety of packaging materials  from corrugated boxes and paperbased
cartons to plastic containers and metal cans  to perform all these functions

understanding that the materials we use must first meet food safety and consumer performance requirements we
are committed to continually improving our packaging to produce the best environmental outcomes for the total
system our 2020 vision for packaging focuses on minimizing waste throughout the complete product and package
system we strive to use the right amount and the right kind of packaging for the job packaging can be part of the
solution to avoiding food waste both in the home and throughout the supply chain we constantly look for ways to
use packaging more efficiently and effectively without compromising consumer value after all we recognize that
people buy our products to enjoy our food and we are committed to giving them the best possible experience with
packaging as an enabler

our research  innovation ri team is responsible for delivering these results while ensuring that our packaging
meets the needs and expectations of our customers and consumers we use life cycle thinking and industry

conagra foods commitment to doing whats right for the environment extends beyond our own operations
influencing the significant investments we make with our supply chain business partners each year our sustainable
sourcing and supplier engagement strategy addresses both commodityspecific situations that do not involve direct
relationships with producers as well as sustainable agriculture practices for key specialty crops that do involve direct
contracts with growers this approach enables us to quickly take action to mitigate environmental or social risks
while establishing collaborative relationships with suppliers who can help us exert a meaningful and positive
influence on the marketplace



sustainable palm oil




conagra foods uses palm oil as a functional ingredient in several of our branded private brand and food service
products due to its unique properties we purchase palm oil from usbased suppliers  some run integrated
operations that cultivate harvest and process the oil and others act as commodities traders who purchase and
distribute palm oil that has been cultivated by other parties over the past several years weve become increasingly
aware of the potential environmental and social risks associated with the cultivation harvesting and processing of
palm oil and we have taken steps to improve the sustainability of our palm oil supply chain

though conagra foods is a relatively minor user of palm oil globally to help ensure our purchases do not contribute
to deforestation of the worlds rainforests or negatively impact the communities that depend on them we will source

application of advanced analytics to enhance farming practices and establish benchmarks for growers related to
their fields and the varieties of potatoes that they plant

in a collaborative effort with customers growers academia and competitors lamb weston participated in
development of the potato sustainability assessment this program allows growers to selfevaluate their farming
operations against best practices to achieve yield quality and conservation this provides active participation by
growers and insight into what practices are utilized as well as their potential impact index scores ranging from
basic to master level help growers and lamb weston to understand where they rank and what opportunities might
exist to improve a program update to facilitate uniform auditing of the assessment is currently in development and
will allow all growers to be uniformly evaluated without numerous varying standards to contend with

for the 2013 crop year 100 percent of lamb weston growers completed the assessment our growers in

promoting sustainable agriculture potatoes and tomatoes
as a food company we have a deep connection to agriculture through the millions of tons of raw ingredients we buy
each year facing the daunting challenge of feeding a growing global population on less land with fewer inputs we
understand that promoting sustainable agricultural practices in our supply chain is an integral part of our longterm
business success




conagra foods focuses sustainable agriculture programs on those crops in which we have a material influence in the
us marketplace through direct relationships with growers focusing primarily on potatoes and tomatoes even
though these crops require a unique sustainable strategy they share some common objectives preserving soil
fertility conserving water minimizing chemical inputs and promoting land stewardship

advancing sustainable growing practices
lamb westons growers have made yearoveryear improvements on the potato sustainability assessment
performing better than the north america average for the past three years




 we source our tomatoes from california where more than 95 percent of the united states and nearly onethird of
 the worlds processed tomatoes are grown1 over the past decade our growers have installed drip irrigation
 systems on about 80 percent of contracted acres improving sustainable farming practices by
  enabling growers to install permanent beds and apply conservation tillage practices reducing farm
   equipment fuel use
  reducing water use by nearly 15 percent compared to traditional furrow irrigation systems
  reducing nutrient and crop management chemical application rates due to precise application


 these enhancements enable our growers to plant fewer acres while yielding the same amount of tomatoes the
 installation of drip irrigation systems increases the tons per acre by about 30 percent meaning that without drip
 irrigation our growers would have needed to farm an additional 7000 acres
