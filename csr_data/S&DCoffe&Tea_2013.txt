a message   here at sd were proud of our record of growth innovation and

            service its what made us the nations largest custom roaster 
from our    and its what makes us such a strong partner for our customers

ceo        across the industry



            as a leading beverage supplier in the foodservice industry we view

            sustainable sourcing practices and corporate social responsibility

            as elements of quality its not enough to simply offer great tasting

            products thats why we strive to deliver the best possible

            experience for everyone who enjoys our beverages  and that starts

            with a commitment to doing right by our people and our planet


            last year we published our first sustainability report to mark our

            start and document our goals and progress regarding several key

            initiatives from increasing supply chain transparency and devel

            oping our principles and standards for sustainably sourced coffee

            and tea to reducing consumption and waste at our main facility

            were making important changes that position us for responsible

            growth in the years to come



            as we look ahead well continue to collaborate throughout our

            company and the greater marketplace to find sustainable solutions
            to the challenges we face what follows is the very latest on our

            collective progress at sd  what weve accomplished together

            what were working on today and what we hope to achieve

            together in the future
