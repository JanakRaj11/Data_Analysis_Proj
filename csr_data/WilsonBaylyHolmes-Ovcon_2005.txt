      chairmans statement




      signiÔ¨Åcant growth      it gives me great pleasure to report that the group has once again achieved increased earnings per
      in all areas           share in an industry not known for stability wbho has consistently produced improved earnings
                             in fact there has not been a year since 1994 that the group has not achieved results better than the
                             previous year in real terms growth in headline earnings per share over this period has been at a
                             compound rate of 27 per annum


      turnover at a          it is also pleasing to report that after a number of years of low growth turnover for the year reached a
      record level           record level of r475 billion in 2005 a large portion of this increase is attributable to the consolidation
                             of the results of our australian subsidiary probuild constructions but apart from this our other
                             contracting operations recorded an increase in turnover of 30 for the year


      cash balances          the increase in activity during the year was anticipated and led us to budget for a higher level of
      improve                capital expenditure this amounted to r174 million compared to r87 million spent in the previous year
                             despite this increase as well as expenditure on other acquisitions and a demand for a higher level of
                             working capital cash balances increased by r95 million during the year the group continues to have
                             no gearing after taking cash balances into account


      buoyant conditions     trading conditions in the building industry in south africa have shown a steady improvement throughout
      expected to continue   the year and all areas are presently working at very high levels of activity this is borne out by the level
                             of our order book which amounted to r42 billion at the end of the year the bulk of the large projects
                             recently announced have not yet commenced and there are already strains arising from shortages of
                             skilled labour and certain construction materials this situation can only lead to higher costs as
                             companies compete for a dwindling pool of resources


      the concor bid         it was with this situation in mind that we initiated a bid to acquire concor limited apart from
                             providing additional resources the merger would have expanded our activities into areas in which we
                             do not presently operate unfortunately we were not able to come to terms with the major shareholder
                             in concor and as a result we withdrew our offer


      acquisitions           the group increased its stake in probuild constructions aust pty limited from 49 to 51 with
                             effect from 1 july 2004 the companys main sphere of operations is in melbourne there has been a
                             decline in construction activity in the city but despite this probuild managed to exceed both its
                             budgeted turnover and proÔ¨Åt for the year although this decline is expected to continue into the new
                             year we are budgeting for proÔ¨Åts of the same order as those achieved in 2005

                             the group also acquired with effect 1 april 2005 a 49 interest in edwin construction pty limited
                             a black empowered roads and earthworks contractor we expect this company to operate successfully
                             but its contribution to group proÔ¨Åts will be minor in nature

acquisitions continued   competition commission approval to acquire the 67 of the shares in capital africa steel pty
                           limited which we did not already own was granted at the end of july 2005 and we will be
                           consolidating the results of this group for 11 months of the new year


black economic             negotiations to establish a construction charter have taken place with various stakeholders throughout
empowerment bee          the year i have been one of the members representing the industry in these negotiations we believe
                           that we are close to a Ô¨Ånal agreement and the charter could come into operation in 2006 this will
                           give clear direction on the most effective way of implementing our bee equity transfer in the meantime
                           skills development procurement and other elements of the scorecard continue to be addressed


prospects                  all indications are that buoyant conditions in the industry should continue for some time there is
                           strong growth in Ô¨Åxed capital investment interest and inÔ¨Çation rates are expected to remain within
                           target levels and gdp growth should increase as previously mentioned the constraints to growth will
                           be the lack of skilled management and labour and shortages of certain materials and equipment it is
                           also vital that the government improves its capacity to deliver on balance we believe that wbho
                           should experience a further year of real growth in earnings per share in 2006


thanks and appreciation    a fair proportion of our turnover derives from repeat work from clients for whom we have contracted
                           for many years we are deeply grateful for this support and look forward to maintaining these
                           relationships for many years to come i would also like to thank my fellow directors for their sound
                           advice and support in particular i would like to thank angus mackenzie who will be retiring as a
                           director at the forthcoming agm his successor as Ô¨Ånancial director of the group will be john abbott
                           who has been with the company for the last 16 years we are conÔ¨Ådent that the transition will be
                           smooth and that john will play a valuable role in maintaining the group on its sound Ô¨Ånancial course
                           finally i would like to thank all our employees for their unstinting efforts in making this another
                           successful year for wbho

      operational review




                            the group has had another successful year with headline earnings up 206 to 2515 cents per share
                            with effect from 1 july 2004 probuild constructions aust pty limited became a subsidiary the
                            accounting treatment has changed and the results of probuild are now consolidated as opposed to
                            being equity accounted

                            the increase in turnover of 30 was due to a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in activity in the building market
                            only a moderate increase in turnover was achieved in the roads and earthworks division but a
                            substantial increase in turnover was achieved in the civil engineering division however our share of
                            this market remains small the percentage of foreign turnover excluding australia remained at the
                            same level as reported last year however the foreign operating proÔ¨Åt excluding australia increased by
                            a substantial 76 operating margins decreased to 39 of turnover compared to the 47 last year
                            the main reason for this is the increase of building work in the turnover mix for the year because of
                            the high level of subcontractor activity in these contracts margins are lower than those prevailing in
                            other types of construction contracts

building division
overview            the division experienced moderate growth in the central areas of south africa but achieved spectacular
                    growth in the coastal regions particularly in the western cape unfortunately contract proÔ¨Åts did not
                    increase in tandem and there was a consequent decrease in margins during the year

      eastern cape                 the eastern cape area has had a good year with building activity increasing steadily over the period
                                   during the year the walker drive shopping centre and extensions to netcares greenacres clinic were
                                   successfully completed currently we are building langeberg mall in mossel bay worth r160 million
                                   and are busy with four residential apartment blocks along the port elizabeth beachfront work has
                                   recently started on the r50 million access park and on new facilities for maritime motors

                                   the building industry in the eastern cape is extremely buoyant at the moment and has a positive
                                   outlook for the medium term we have already secured in the region of 80 of our forecast turnover
                                   for the new year which itself is 25 times higher than 2005


      probuild                     this is the Ô¨Årst year in which probuilds results have been consolidated the groups roots are in the
                                   nonresidential building industry in melbourne two years ago a branch was established in sydney and
                                   a 60 stake acquired in a civil engineering contracting company basic constructions in brisbane


                                   despite a downturn in the value of work on offer in melbourne we nevertheless managed to increase
                                   turnover by 30 however margins were affected and although proÔ¨Åts for the year were on budget
                                   they were slightly lower than those achieved in 2004


                                   we were busy on a number of contracts in sydney during the year the largest being the common a
                                   17storey apartment block on the fringes of the sydney cbd the company has now established a Ô¨Årm
                                   foothold in sydney and this should augur well for the future


                                   construction activity in brisbane has been at a high level and this is reÔ¨Çected in basic constructions
                                   turnover for the year which has increased by 74 proÔ¨Åts for the year have also shown very strong
                                   growth


                                   it should be kept in mind that the activities in sydney and brisbane are small compared to those in
                                   melbourne despite the expected continued decline in construction activity we are nevertheless
                                   budgeting for proÔ¨Åts of a similar level as those achieved in 2005


      civil engineering division   despite the civil market being very quiet for the period under review we performed satisfactorily with
                                   revenue and margins being well above budget projects were undertaken for sasol impala platinum
                                   lonmin xstrata alloys and anglo platinum amongst others

                                   it is anticipated that there will be a signiÔ¨Åcant upturn in the civil engineering market in the coming
                                   year with a number of major projects being launched in the mining power generation and

roads and earthworks division

overview                   the roads and earthworks division traded satisfactorily with a reduction of 10 of anticipated turnover
                           and an increase in budgeted proÔ¨Åts for the year under review the restructuring of the division into
                           regions at the beginning of the year has proved successful

                           prospects for the division for the next Ô¨Ånancial year are good and almost 80 of the projected annual
                           turnover for 2006 has already been secured


rsa                        during the year we were awarded two major contracts by acsa for the upgrading of echo apron and
                           the construction of the rapid exit taxiways at johannesburg international airport the Ô¨Çow of work
                           from mining infrastructure contracts on both platinum and coal mines has increased and a number of
                           smaller contracts were successfully completed during the year although hampered by bad weather and
                           tough physical conditions the work on the berg river dam is continuing satisfactorily good progress is

                           contract for similar work at the oubaai golf resort was successfully completed earlier this year and the

                           exchange rates have resulted in a loss being reported on our en1 road contract all expected losses
                           have been accounted for in this Ô¨Ånancial year the challenge in the new Ô¨Ånancial year in mozambique
                           is to secure the work required to meet our budget

                           in botswana we have completed the infrastructure contract at tonota we are currently busy with
                           various smaller contracts at the orapa mine and in gaborone

                           running well and should continue into the third quarter of the new Ô¨Ånancial year we have secured
                           mining infrastructure work in ghana and are looking to enlarge our footprint in this country

                           the arbitration of our lesotho contract dispute is being heard by a panel of international arbitrators
                           and should be Ô¨Ånalised by june 2006 no claims have been included in our results

      nomination committee     with a small board of Ô¨Åve directors we believe the creation of a nominations committee would be
