  creating a perpetually sustainable
  clean energy society
  we have made it our mission to contribute to the creation of a low carbon society through clean energy our core business revolves
  liquefied petroleum gas lpg which has been widely acclaimed as a clean disaster resilient decentralized energy source we engage
  in a wide range of activities here at iwatani from promoting lpgbased gas heat pump ghp air conditioning and cogeneration systems
  to using lpg alongside city gas and installing lpg emergency generators all of these activities help to reduce peak power consumption
  and create a stronger society that is less dependent on any single source of energy we are also committed to improving our lpg centers
  equipping them with disaster prevention capabilities in order to further reinforce our stable supply structure
  as well as lpg demand for liquefied natural gas lng as a clean energy source is also on the increase we have a complete lng supply
  structure here at iwatani and are constantly working to increase supply volumes in order to cater effectively to users needs in the future
  we can t afford to stand still in our quest to create a low carbon society our trump card in that quest is hydrogen the ultimate source of
  clean energy
  we have had our sights set on potential demand for hydrogen for over half a century and have continued to pave the way for a new era
  of hydrogen energy including establishing japan s first commercial liquid hydrogen plant with the completion of our yamaguchi liquid
  hydrogen plant in shunan yamaguchi prefecture in spring of next year we intend to increase our number of liquid hydrogen plants to
  three alongside our facilities in osaka and chiba this will reinforce our supply structure and make it easier for us to cater to demand
  from customers in western japan we are also making steady progress with the development of new technologies and applications
  working in partnership with various different companies a prime example is kitakyushu hydrogen town where we are now in the testing
  phases the road towards a hydrogen society is becoming clearer and iwatani is set to play an increasingly important role
  as our energy situation becomes more and more critical we are determined to enhance our efforts to create a clean energy society in
  march 2013 work will be completed on our new general technology center this will enable us to provide technical support for the
  creation of a new energy society by combining energy sources such as lpg solar cells and hydrogen to the best possible effect as well as
  helping our customers to resolve issues through services such as contracted experiments and technical support we are also aiming to
  develop technologies that will cater to a wide range of needs throughout society by developing products in partnership with our customers
  for example making the most of our new general technology center we are determined to showcase iwatani s value as a technical special
  ist and become an even more essential part of society we hope that we can rely on your continued support and assistance in the future

            providing reassurance and helping to enrich
            we are starting to see the decentralization of energy sources within japanese society the aim is to put an end our depen
            dence on electricity and city gas so as to create a society that is more resilient to disasters and other risks as a result lpg
            is attracting a lot of attention as a selfcontained environmentally friendly energy source as a leading lpg supplier we were
            one of the first companies to address this issue we offer companies households and other users diverse energy systems
            revolving primarily around lpg we also promote the use of lpg in conjunction with city gas and are continually working to
            reinforce our stable supply structure
