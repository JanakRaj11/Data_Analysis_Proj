bellzone assets
on 16 august 2013 bellzone released an updated joint ore reserves committee jorc iron ore resource statement
for kalia the report based on geological work undertaken as part of the kalia bankable feasibility study bfs showed

		   highgrade indicated and inferred mineral resources of 1242mt at 535 fe
		   highgrade oxidestyle resource converted from inferred to indicated level and a supergene banded iron formation
      sbif mineral resource of 728mt at 537 fe
		   total oxide and sbif indicated and inferred mineral resource of 9132mt at 363 fe
		   total oxide and sbif indicated mineral resource of 2646mt grading at 398 fe
		   magnetite banded iron formation resources of 472 billion tonnes at 293 fe

the kalia mineral resources translate to a potential production of 19 billion tonnes of saleable iron ore

on 13 september 2013 the company announced a jorc probable reserve of 598mt at 541 fe a fully independent
bfs on the first stage of iron ore production at kalia kp1 was announced on 17 september 2013

on 15 october 2015 the company announced a maiden jorc mineral resource estimate of 7928mt at 069 ni
at a cutoff of 050 ni this nickel resource is contiguous with and in some places overlies the highgrade iron ore
resources and reserves at kalia it represents a planned substage or precursor to the exploitation of iron ore at kalia
further details of the companys plans to exploit the nickel resources will be disclosed upon completion of the current
feasibility study work

the forécariah joint venture fjv held 5050 with china international fund limited was placed into liquidation
by the singapore high court in december 2015 and the courtappointed liquidators from korda mentha pte ltd
singapore are in the process of winding up the fjv company whose major investment is its 100 shareholding in the
guineaincorporated forécariah guinea mining sa fgmsa the liquidation remains ongoing as no material update
in relation to the liquidation of fgmsa has been received by korda mentha and it is not known when the liquidation of
fgmsa will be finalised as well as being the only shareholders with equal holdings bellzone and china international
fund limited are also both major creditors to the fjv company and await the completion of korda menthas work

addendum update of the mining convention
bellzones mining convention was ratified in 2010 but in 2014 the unexpected drastic economic downturn and the ebola
outbreak in west africa caused plans to begin iron ore production at kalia to be put on hold and negatively impacted the
balance of the convention in 2015 bellzone and the guinean government began renegotiations in accordance with the
provisions of the convention as part of the nationwide audit process carried out by the guinean governments technical
committee for the review of mining titles and conventions comité technique de revue des titres et conventions
miniers or ctrtcm

the ctrtcm was formally disbanded in april 2016 whereafter negotiations continued directly with the ministry of mines
and geology which had taken over the files agreement on an addendum document avenant no 1 à là convention de
base has been reached and the company is awaiting formal signature of the addendum

the addendum reflects the parties goodfaith efforts to comply with article 52 of the existing convention to amend it
as necessary to restore the balance that initially prevailed at the original signing importantly the addendum provides the
legal framework for detailed commitments by bellzone conclusively to determine the feasibility of its planned ferronickel
project implement such project if feasible and define the path towards the realisation of the worldclass kp1 iron ore
project at kalia

going concern
the company is currently solely reliant on continued funding from its majority shareholder hudson global group
limited hudson in succession to china sonangol international s pte ltd china sonangol to continue to meet its
obligations as and when they fall due for a period of 12 months from the date of this report this is further discussed on
page 11 in the directors report and note 2f in the consolidated financial statements

unity as a company
the unexpectedly long negotiation process to update the mining convention coupled with continuing efforts to minimise
operating costs resulted in even more pressure on our people to work with fewer available resources it was vital for
the entire bellzone team to rally together to make significant sacrifices from kalia camp employees to the boardroom
frequent and frank communications between management and the labour union became the norm and we have been
able to build a foundation of trust which stands the company in good stead for the future the visionary leadership of
our labour union as well as the unwavering support of the communities of faranah and konta have helped to continue
to distinguish bellzone as one of the longest continuously operating and contributing mining companies in guinea
the spirit of partnership characterised by good faith and pragmatism with the guinean government in particular the
ministry of mines and geology as well as with key representatives from the national assembly has also resulted in a
much clearer road ahead although it is inevitable for some bumps to remain a part of the journey our unity will continue
to be our key strength

approved by the board on 29 june 2017

c h a i r m a n s s tat ement


this last year proved every bit as exciting and challenging as we had envisaged and was clearly a valuable reset point
for both bellzone and the guinean government we accomplished our goals of completing a substantial portion of the
ferronickel feasibility study by the end of august 2016 and drastically reducing our operating expenses we have also
continuously engaged with the ministry of mines and geology on an addendum to update our 2010 mining convention
and it is highly pleasing that the content of the addendum has now been provisionally agreed we await the signed
addendum and will update the market in due course in the meantime the new interministerial council has been settling
in and has been pushing ahead with an ambitious development agenda including clarifying the way forward with respect
to the important simandou deposit this will undoubtedly have important short and long term spillover benefits for
bellzones kalia iron ore project

such collective progress bodes well for the future however challenging operating conditions persist for mining juniors
and coupled with the unfortunate delay in finalising our updated legal framework with the government we have had to
further reduce operating costs and place more employees on longer technical leave long term partpaid leave allowed
under guinean employment law this meant also that the timetable to complete the ferronickel technical and economic
evaluation work has had to be moved back by at least six months but with agreement reached on an update to the mining
convention we fully expect work to recommence immediately upon ratification of the addendum document

despite the difficulties the leadership team has managed to achieve strong rapport with the authorities and local
communities as well as truly resilient esprit de corps amongst our employees this admirable solidarity will be the
basis for our success and we must continue to build on our considerable strengths on behalf of the board and our
shareholders i would like to express enormous gratitude to our employees and everyone else involved with bellzone for
their commitment and hard work selfless sacrifices and invaluable goodwill

we believe assuming long term operational financing is secured that the worst is now behind us including the
unprecedented collapse in iron ore prices of 201415 and that the way forwards should now become less bumpy
even if there are still economic headwinds fullyear funding agreement from our major shareholder has once more been
obtained for calendar 2017 and this year we will need to borrow even less than in 2015 and 2016 we should be able
to complete our ferronickel project evaluation using the funds already raised for that purpose and we are cautiously
optimistic that emerging strategic interest in guinea and the iron ore sector in general can catalyse earlier development
of the kalia deposit

bellzones potential intrinsic value has not changed our jorc reserves and resources are welldocumented and
compare very favourably in size and quality relative to other iron ore mines globally whether in production or not kalia
is strategically located with good relative accessibility and our path to production is unambiguously short we are among
the longest established mining companies in guinea and have previously obtained full project financing proposals on the
basis of our kp1 bfs in 2013

now that negotiations on the addendum have been concluded we will be able to focus all of our management and
financial resources on executing what we have agreed as well as on a more comprehensive investor education and
outreach programme we continue to be grateful to our shareholders for standing by us all this while and look forward to
beginning to pay back your good faith by unlocking our significant embedded value with concrete progress

review of business in the year
substantial success was achieved in further reducing operating expenses with actual expenditure 154 per cent below
the us65 million budget for 2016 which itself represented a 35 per cent reduction from the us100 million budget
for 2015

bellzones operating costs which exclude amortisation depreciation and loss on disposal of fixed assets increased
slightly from 579 million in 2015 to 588 million in 2016 despite incurring 617000 on feasibility study work for
the ferronickel project including the additional interest due on the loans to china sonangol and hudson the annual loss
narrowed to 80 million a reduction of 7 per cent over the previous year and no new significant impairments to the
balance sheet or significant provisions have been necessary

the cost savings were achieved mainly as a result of closure of the corporate office in jersey relocation of the companys
it function to singapore and savings generated from guinea operations due to extended technical leave

in anticipation of the feasibility study work required for the ferronickel project bellzone raised 135 million approximately
us20 million through an equity placement in january 2016 with our major shareholder hudson global group limited
hudson which resulted in an increase in hudsons shareholding from 505 to 619 this prefunding exercise
allowed bellzone to carry out additional geological and metallurgical analyses on the identified nickel resource and
complete the first and most important phase of the technical study with tenova minerals pty ltd as our main contractor
in four months between may and september 2016 our preliminary conclusions were announced on 25 august 2016
up to now 46 per cent of the funds raised for feasibility study work have been utilised and the remaining funds are
expected to be sufficient to complete the technical work to reach a more definitive conclusion regarding the economic
viability of the ferronickel project

in parallel management also assessed options to acquire interests in cashflow producing and potentially earnings
accretive assets one promising asset in southeast asia in particular was identified and highlevel due diligence was
carried out but a transaction did not prove possible to conclude management continues to evaluate strategic options
both on a proactive and opportunistic basis

there has been no change in bellzones funding situation with our major shareholder hudson providing all of our financial
support our tight budget discipline meant that we needed to draw down only on the last instalment of us500000
from the first us65 million secured loan from hudson meant to meet bellzones budgeted working capital obligations
for 2016 at the end of march 2017 at 31 december 2016 no amounts had been drawn down under the second loan
facility of us40 million agreed with hudson to meet 2017 working capital needs the first draw down under this loan
of us800000 was made on 6 june 2017 bellzones board continues actively to explore all alternative financing options
as market conditions change and as positive developments in guinea continue

outlook and strategy
the main operating objective for 2017 will be to complete the technical work related to the ferronickel project in line
with bellzones new commitments pursuant to the newlyagreed addendum to the mining convention if the results are
positive the focus will then be on obtaining the required financing to start construction without delay

at the same time management intends to work closely and continuously with our broker and other market participants to
assess funding options which will be accretive to the company and which may allow bellzone to plan ahead to meet our
loan obligations to hudson when they become due in march 2018

bellzones main focus remains the development of our worldclass kalia iron ore deposit provided the uplift in the iron
ore price between 4q2016 and 1q2017 begins to become more sustained and there is strong resurgent investor interest
bellzone is prepared to move quickly to update our kp1 bankable feasibility study andor consider other partnerships
which may facilitate the earlier exploitation of the kalia resources



                                                                                                                             5

impacts the original outbreak started in december 2013 and killed more than 11000 people across guinea liberia and
sierra leone

on 29 march 2016 the un declared the outbreak to be over although the un has cautioned that high vigilance is
required to protect against any further outbreaks much has been learned about the disease the emergency response
structures medical facilities and supplies that have been left in place for any future occurrences hopefully mean that we
should not expect to see any such outbreak again and that isolated cases will be identified quickly and remain rare

ebola had a minimal impact on bellzone within guinea occasionally compromising our ability to move people incountry
and in particular around conakry the densest population centre and capital city there were very few cases reported in
faranah prefecture host to the kalia licence during the whole of the outbreak

of obtaining a renewed certificate of environmental compliance from the guinean authorities which is expected to be
valid for one year after the renewal date

going concern
the nature of the groups current activities does not provide the group with production or trading revenues the group
is currently in advanced discussions with the government of guinea to amend its kalia mining convention to resolve
the technical breach and provide the necessary framework for the development of the proposed ferronickel project
the approval process is ongoing at the date of this report the directors having considered the progress made to date
and correspondence between the group and the guinean government expect resolution of this matter will occur later
in 2017

following the expected amendment to the kalia mining convention noted above the group will continue feasibility study
work on its proposed ferronickel project within the kalia licence area and has set aside sufficient funding to complete
this study which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018 however our ability to complete this study is also
dependent on our majority shareholder hudson releasing the remaining funds from its us40 million facility which is at
their discretion and likely to be impacted if agreement is not reached on the amendment to the kalia convention

given difficult market conditions bellzone remains wholly reliant on its majority shareholder hudson china sonangol a
related company of hudson provided loan financing to the company from august 2014 to the end of 2015 totalling a
principal amount of us102 million hudson provided a second loan in the principal amount of us65 million to finance
the company through 2016 with the final drawdown on this loan received in march 2017 the company has drawn
these loans fully amounting to us167 million and the total principal and accrued interest for both loans was us185
million as at 31 december 2016 a further loan of us40 million was agreed with hudson but undrawn at the end of
2016 to enable the company to continue operating through 2017 and the first draw down on this loan in the amount of
us800000 was completed on 6 june 2017 it is at hudsons discretion to allow further drawdowns under this facility
further details are provided in note 23 due to successful cost management which has obviated the need to draw down
on this third loan earlier this most recent loan amount is expected to be sufficient to meet bellzones working capital
needs up to june 2018 subject to assumptions necessarily made in respect of the groups cashflow forecast

all three loan agreements have the same repayment date for principal and accrued interest of 31 march 2018 if no
additional funds are raised before such time to allow bellzone to discharge its loan obligations bellzone china sonangol
and hudson will need to reach agreement on a suitable arrangement to defer repayment such that bellzone will not be in
default no such agreement has been reached at the date of this report

a positive outcome on the ferronickel feasibility study is uncertain and in any event additional funding is likely to be
required to advance the project to a bankable feasibility stage furthermore to commence development significant
funding would be required from external parties which is not committed at the date of this annual report

the current cash reserves and shareholder loans would be sufficient to see the groups activities through to the end
of june 2018 however drawdowns on the shareholder loan facility are at the discretion of the shareholder and the
repayment date of these shareholder loans made by china sonangol and hudson is 31 march 2018 the group will
therefore require drawdowns to be made available and further financing beyond 31 march 2018 to enable it to continue
to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due if an agreement cannot be reached with china sonangol and hudson to
extend the repayment date of the loans

the group continues to evaluate its strategy and its ability to secure funding that would enable it both to continue
operations for the short term and in the long term to develop the kalia licence area however at present there are no
committed facilities which would enable bellzone for a period of 12 months from the date of these financial statements
nor provide certainty that the ferronickel feasibility study can be completed in the event of hudson withdrawing support
the directors view is that additional funding may be sourced from one or more of the following

		   placement of further securities
		   the sale of assets andor
		   funding in exchange for an interest in the groups projects or future production from the projects


                                                                                                                      11

whilst the above funding sources are considered available to the group there are currently no advanced plans to execute
any of these funding strategies

hudson has confirmed in a letter to the directors its current intention to continue making funds available to support
the groups working capital requirements for a period of 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements
on a basis that allows hudson to change that intention on this basis and given hudsons past support the directors
believe that hudson will continue to provide ongoing funding to bellzone as well as consider favourably postponing the
repayment date for all of its existing loans

taking the above factors into account the directors believe it is reasonable to expect that the group will obtain sufficient
funding from one or more of the aforementioned funding sources and have continued to adopt the going concern basis
of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements however the directors wish to highlight that there
is a material uncertainty in relation to the continuing support from hudson in particular the availability of committed
shortterm funding and reaching an agreement for the deferral of the repayment date for its loan facilities

as the directors have concluded that there is a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the ability of
bellzone to continue as a going concern beyond a period of 12 months from the date of this report there is a risk that the
group and company may be unable to realise their assets and discharge their liabilities in the normal course of business
the financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the company was unable to continue as
a going concern

		   the board should include at least two independent nonexecutive directors increasing where additional expertise
      is considered desirable in certain areas or to ensure a smooth transition between outgoing and incoming
      nonexecutive directors and

the directors are of the view that the board and its committees consist of directors with an appropriate balance of skills
experience independence and diverse backgrounds to enable them to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively

independence
the board has adopted a formal policy for the determination of the independence of the nonexecutive directors

among the key criteria of the independence policy are independence from management and the absence of any business
relationship which could materially interfere with the directors independence of judgment and ability to provide a strong
valuable contribution to the boards deliberations or which could interfere with the directors ability to act in the best
interests of the company

where contracts in the ordinary course of business exist between bellzone mining plc and a company in which a director
has declared an interest these are reviewed for materiality both to the group and the other party to the contract
material is defined in the policy as being where the relationship accounts for more than two per cent of either partys
consolidated gross revenue per annum although the test also takes other circumstances into account

the code includes criteria to assess independence where a director has served on the board for more than nine years
from the date of their first election by shareholders

the chairman was considered independent upon his appointment in november 2007 under the code and in the boards
view he continues to satisfy the tests for independence

after rigorously applying the criteria of the independence policy the board is satisfied that all of its nonexecutive
directors are and remain independent other than angel tong who was nominated to the board by china sonangol

              the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with ifrs as adopted for use in the

              the financial statements estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical
              experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under

2 		   basis of preparation continued

        e		   critical accounting estimates and judgements continued

               the group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future and the resulting accounting estimates will
               by definition seldom equal the related actual results the estimates and assumptions that have a significant
               risk of causing a material adjustment to the financial results or the financial position reported in future periods
               are disclosed below

               mineral properties in the exploration and evaluation phase and exploration expenditure

               judgement is applied by management in determining when a project has reached a stage at which economically
               recoverable reserves exist and that development may be sanctioned the company has determined that the
               most appropriate accounting policy for the kalia asset is to expense all exploration activity other than the
               initial licence acquisition costs as incurred

               management is also required to make certain judgements and assumptions as to events and circumstances that
               may occur in the future in particular the ongoing validity of the mining licence whether extraction operations
               are economically viable where reserves have been discovered and whether indications of impairment under
               ifrs 6 exist any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available

               property plant and equipment  recoverable amount

               the calculation of the recoverable amount and useful life of an asset requires significant judgements estimates
               and assumptions including future demand technological changes exchange rates interest rates and others

               the group assesses each cash generating unitinvestment cgu annually to determine whether any indication
               of impairment exists where an indicator of impairment exists a formal estimate of the recoverable amount
               is made which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use depending
               on the asset type these assessments require the use of estimates and assumptions such as future commodity
               prices discount rates future capital requirements exploration potential and operating performance fair value
               is determined as managements best estimate of the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset
               in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties cash flows are discounted by an
               appropriate discount rate to determine the net present value

        f		   going concern

               the nature of the groups current activities does not provide the group with production or trading revenues
               the group is currently in advanced discussions with the government of guinea to amend its kalia mining
               convention to resolve the technical breach and provide the necessary framework for the development of the
               proposed ferronickel project the approval process is ongoing at the date of this report the directors having
               considered the progress made to date and correspondence between the group and the guinean government
               expect resolution of this matter will occur later in 2017

2 		   basis of preparation continued

        f		   going concern continued

               following the expected amendment to the kalia mining convention noted above the group will continue
               feasibility study work on its proposed ferronickel project within the kalia licence area and has set aside
               sufficient funding to complete this study which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018 however
               our ability to complete this study is also dependent on our majority shareholder hudson releasing the remaining
               funds from its us40 million facility which is at their discretion and likely to be impacted if agreement is not
               reached on the amendment to the kalia convention

               given difficult market conditions bellzone remains wholly reliant on its majority shareholder hudson china
               sonangol a related company of hudson provided loan financing to the company from august 2014 to the
               end of 2015 totalling a principal amount of us102 million hudson provided a second loan in the principal
               amount of us65 million to finance the company through 2016 with the final drawdown on this loan
               received in march 2017 the company has drawn these loans fully amounting to us167 million and the total
               principal and accrued interest for both loans was us185 million as at 31 december 2016 a further loan of
               us40 million was agreed with hudson but undrawn at the end of 2016 to enable the company to continue
               operating through 2017 and the first draw down on this loan in the amount of us800000 was completed
               on 6 june 2017 it is at hudsons discretion to allow further drawdowns under this facility further details are
               provided in note 23 due to successful cost management which has obviated the need to draw down on this
               third loan earlier this most recent loan amount is expected to be sufficient to meet bellzones working capital
               needs up to june 2018 subject to assumptions necessarily made in respect of the groups cashflow forecast

               all three loan agreements have the same repayment date for principal and accrued interest of 31 march 2018
               if no additional funds are raised before such time to allow bellzone to discharge its loan obligations bellzone
               china sonangol and hudson will need to reach agreement on a suitable arrangement to defer repayment such
               that bellzone will not be in default no such agreement has been reached at the date of this report

               a positive outcome on the ferronickel feasibility study is uncertain and in any event additional funding is likely
               to be required to advance the project to a bankable feasibility stage furthermore to commence development
               significant funding would be required from external parties which is not committed at the date of this
               annual report

               the current cash reserves and shareholder loans would be sufficient to see the groups activities through
               to the end of june 2018 however drawdowns on the shareholder loan facility are at the discretion of the
               shareholder and the repayment date of these shareholder loans made by china sonangol and hudson is 31
               march 2018 the group will therefore require drawdowns to be made available and further financing beyond
               31 march 2018 to enable it to continue to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due if an agreement cannot
               be reached with china sonangol and hudson to extend the repayment date of the loans

               the group continues to evaluate its strategy and its ability to secure funding that would enable it both to
               continue operations for the short term and in the long term to develop the kalia licence area however at
               present there are no committed facilities which would enable bellzone for a period of 12 months from the date
               of these financial statements nor provide certainty that the ferronickel feasibility study can be completed in
               the event of hudson withdrawing support the directors view is that additional funding may be sourced from
               one or more of the following

                placement of further securities
                the sale of assets andor
                funding in exchange for an interest in the groups projects or future production from the projects



                                                                                                                            29

        f		   going concern continued

               whilst the above funding sources are considered available to the group there are currently no advanced plans
               to execute any of these funding strategies

               hudson has confirmed in a letter to the directors its current intention to continue making funds available
               to support the groups working capital requirements for a period of 12 months from the date of signing the
               financial statements on a basis that allows hudson to change that intention on this basis and given hudsons
               past support the directors believe that hudson will continue to provide ongoing funding to bellzone as well
               as consider favourably postponing the repayment date for all of its existing loans

               taking the above factors into account the directors believe it is reasonable to expect that the group will
               obtain sufficient funding from one or more of the aforementioned funding sources and have continued to
               adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements however
               the directors wish to highlight that there is a material uncertainty in relation to the continuing support from
               hudson in particular the availability of committed shortterm funding and reaching an agreement for the
               deferral of the repayment date for its loan facilities

               as the directors have concluded that there is a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the
               ability of bellzone to continue as a going concern beyond a period of 12 months from the date of this report
               there is a risk that the group and company may be unable to realise their assets and discharge their liabilities
               in the normal course of business the financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if
               the company was unable to continue as a going concern


3		    significant accounting policies

        a		   basis of consolidation

               subsidiaries

               subsidiaries controlled by the group are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition being the date on
               which the group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases
               the financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company
               using consistent accounting policies all intragroup balances transactions unrealised gains and losses
               resulting from intragroup transactions are eliminated in full

               bellzone employee share plan trust

               in december 2010 the group formed an independent bellzone employee share plan trust bespt or trust
               to hold and administer ordinary shares purchased to satisfy awards made through the employee share plan
               see note 21 the shares were transferred to employees on their respective vesting dates subject to the
               satisfaction of the various conditions of the plan the trust was consolidated within the group

               the shares held by the trust ranked pari passu with the existing ordinary shares of the company were admitted
               to trading and were disclosed as part of the issued capital of the company the cost of shares temporarily held
               by the trust was reflected as treasury shares and deducted from equity see note 3 m

               the bespt was dissolved on 19 december 2016 there are no outstanding employee or executive share
               options and both schemes have been terminated at the time of dissolution the bespt held 21652840
               ordinary shares of no par value ordinary shares in the issued share capital of the company these shares
               have been transferred to bellzone mining plc and will be held in treasury

              joint ventures

              the group had an interest up to date of liquidation in december 2015 in a joint venture which was a jointly
              controlled entity whereby the venturers had a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control over the
              economic activities of the entity this agreement required unanimous agreement in financial and operating
              decisions among the venturers

              the interest in a jointly controlled entity was accounted for using the equity method after initially being
              recognised at cost under the equity method the share of the profits or losses of the entity were recognised
              in the profit or loss and the share of postacquisition movements in reserves was recognised in other
              comprehensive income

       b		   foreign currency translation

              transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of
              the transaction

              monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to
              the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at that date

              foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in equity as part of the cumulative
              translation adjustment note 12

              nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency
              are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction nonmonetary assets and liabilities
              denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to the functional currency at
              foreign exchange rates prevailing at the dates the fair value was determined

              foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis

       c		   financial assets

              recognition and measurement

              quoted in an active market after initial measurement such financial assets are subsequently measured at
              amortised cost using the effective interest rate eir method less impairment amortised cost is calculated by
              taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the
              eir the eir amortisation is included in finance income in the consolidated income statement this category

              this is the category most relevant to the group after initial recognition interestbearing loans and borrowings
              are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eir method gains and losses are recognised in profit
              or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the eir amortisation process amortised cost
              is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an
              integral part of the eir the eir amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss

              items of plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation where parts
              of an item of plant and equipment have different useful lives they are accounted for as separate items of plant
              and equipment

              cost

              the group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of plant and equipment the

              		    cost of replacing any part of such an item when that cost is incurred if it is probable that the future
                     economic benefits embodied within the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be
                     measured reliably

              each part of an item of plant and equipment

              the estimated useful lives in the current and comparative periods are calculated from the date of operational
              commissioning and are as follows

              other intangible asset with finite life is amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment
              whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired the amortisation period and the

              the cost of acquiring exploration and evaluation assets mineral reserves and mineral resources is capitalised
              on the balance sheet as incurred under the heading mineral properties in the exploration and evaluation
              phase as this asset is not available for use it is not depreciated in line with the requirements of ifrs 6
              exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources

              where a decision is made to proceed with development in respect of a particular area of interest the
              relevant mineral properties asset is tested for impairment and the balance is then reclassified as an asset in
              development within intangible assets and any subsequent expenditure is capitalised and depreciated using a
              unit of production method based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate or
              are written off if the property is abandoned

              amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a unit of production basis over the estimated useful lives of
              intangible assets other than goodwill from the date that they are available for use

                       is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount

                       the carrying amounts of the groups nonfinancial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to
                       determine whether there is any indication of impairment if any such indication exists then the assets
                       recoverable amount is estimated an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset
                       exceeds its estimated recoverable amount impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss an assets
                       recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cgus fair value less cost to sell and its value in use
                       and is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are
                       largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets when the carrying amount of an
                       asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and is written down
                       to its recoverable amount in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to
                       their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
                       value of money and the risks specific to the asset in determining fair value less costs to sell recent
                       market transactions are taken into account if available if no such transactions can be identified an

              iii   impairment reversals

                      for assets an assessment is made at each reporting date whether there is any indication that previously
                      recognised impairment losses no longer exist or may have been decreased if such indication exists
                      the group estimates the assets or cgus recoverable amount a previously recognised impairment loss
                      is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable
                      amount since the last impairment loss was recognised the reversal is limited so that the carrying amount
                      of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount nor exceed the carrying amount that would have
                      been determined net of depreciation had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior
                      years such reversal is recognised in the income statements unless the asset is carried at a revalued
                      amount in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase

       l		   employee benefits

              a liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries annual leave
              and long service leave when it is probable that settlement will be required and they are capable of being
              measured reliably

              liabilities recognised in respect of employee benefits expected to be settled within 12 months are measured
              at their nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement

       m		   sharebased payment transactions

              sharebased payment arrangements in which the group receives assets goods or services as consideration for
              its own equity instruments are accounted for as equitysettled sharebased payment transactions regardless
              of how the equity instruments are obtained by the group

              the grant date fair value of sharebased payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee
              expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the period that the employees become unconditionally
              entitled to the awards

              for sharebased payment awards with nonvesting conditions the grant date fair value of the sharebased
              payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no recognition of differences between expected
              and actual outcomes in relation to such conditions

              the fair value of options granted is measured using an option valuation model taking into consideration the
              terms and conditions upon which the options were granted the amount recognised as an expense is adjusted
              to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service andor nonmarket vesting conditions
              are expected to be met such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of
              awards that meet the related service and nonmarket performance conditions at the vesting date

              the fair value of the employee share options is measured using the blackscholes formula measurement
              inputs include share price on measurement date exercise price of the instrument expected volatility based
              on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information
              weighted average expected life of the instruments based on historical experience and general option holder
              behaviour expected dividends and the riskfree interest rate based on government bonds service and
              nonmarket performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining
              fair value

              the principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the group the fair value of an asset
              or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or
              liability assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest

              a fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset takes into account a market participants ability to generate
              economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant
              that would use the asset in its highest and best use

              the group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data
              are available to measure fair value maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use
              of unobservable inputs all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial
              statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows based on the lowest level
              input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole

                              measurement is unobservable for assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial
                              statements on a recurring basis the group determines whether transfers have occurred
                              between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest level
                              input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each
                              reporting period

              the group determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement and unquoted
              financial assets and for nonrecurring measurement

              at each reporting date the group analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which
              are required to be measured again or reassessed as per the groups accounting policies for this analysis
              the group verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation
              computation to contracts and other relevant documents

              the group in conjunction with its external valuers where applicable also compares each of the changes in the
              fair value of each asset and liability with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable

              for the purpose of fair value disclosures the group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the
              basis of the nature characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as
              explained above

              lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the income statement and reduction of the lease
              obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability

             be relied upon to serve and promote the best interests of the company

             scheme was deemed to be the date the board has made the recommendation to the trust and the fair value
             of the award was calculated based on the fair value of the equity instrument on the day the recommendation
             was made

             the rules provided that the trustee of the bespt had the sole and absolute discretion to determine whether
             to make an award to an eligible employee on such terms and conditions if any as it sees fit and whether on
             the basis of a recommendation by the board or otherwise the trust has been presented as part of the group

             i		    foreign exchange risk

             ii		   interest rate risk

                      the group is exposed to interest rate risk as the group places cash and short term deposits at floating
                      interest rates the risk is managed by the group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and
                      floating interest rates

                      the group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit
                      and loss due to the short term nature of deposits therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting
                      date would not affect profit or loss

                      the group holds floating interest rate financial liabilities in the form of a loan facility with china
                      sonangol the group is therefore exposed to changes in usd libor which may affect profit or loss in
                      future periods

      c		   liquidity risk

             liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due
             the groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure as far as possible that it will always have sufficient
             liquidity to meet its liabilities when they fall due under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring
             unacceptable losses or risking damage to the groups reputation

             typically the group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses
             for a period of 12 months including the servicing of financial obligations this excludes the potential impact
             of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted such as natural disasters
