                            efficient delivery system that will reduce the length and amount of power outages provide
                        more detailed information on individual energy usage to customers enable new pricing
programs for customers interested in saving money by using energy smarter and increase the availability of renewable
energy
     to help residents maximize benefits the department of environmental control is using grant funding from the
illinois science and energy innovation foundation to ensure that information on the smart grid is readily available
in the community by integrating energy efficiency messaging throughout the countys outreach efforts including

reducing waste
the group has also explored grant funding to place additional recycling containers throughout several cook county
facilities this effort would allow for collection of beverage containers in common areas as well as additional paper
recycling bins throughout office areas the group is also exploring how to increase other recycling programs such as
copier toner recycling

lamp crusher
facilities management and the bureau of administration
procured a fluorescent lamp crusher which reduces the
countys shipments of spent mercury containing lamps
significantly each 55gallon drum of crushed lamps holds approximately
1300 spent lamps about fifteen times more lamps than could be shipped in
a similar container were the lamps not crushed on site this process should also
reduce accidental breakage of lamps during storage and shipping

documents management
cook county recycled more than one million pounds of old documents in the last yearandahalf confronting a
decadesold problem of records storage while generating savings and revenue for the county
     among the documents collected for disposal were old financial spreadsheets dated legal journals files from long
ago settled court cases yearsold dog bite incident reports and documents from expired bond transactions
some of the paperwork dated back to the 1960s
     importantly none of the 114 million pounds of paper was sent to a landfill instead the paper was sold for
recycling through a contract with a county vendor in addition by centralizing the disposal process through the
records management and salvage divisions  formerly a number of units within the county had their own contracts
for document disposal  the county has saved at least 200000 from what it would have spent with multiple vendors
for the same services

energy                                                   goal reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 by 2050


the county remains on track toward the 2050 goal and once again surpassed the annual target through energy
efficiency measures the county decreased emissions by 11 percent staying well ahead of the 8 percent decrease
target for this year since 2010 we have reduced emissions equivalent to taking more than 20000 passenger vehicles
off the road for a year the county closed out construction on the energy performance contract at the hospital in
the first half of 2015 and is scheduled to close out the jail campus project in november 2015 these two campuses
represent the two largest energy consumers in the county the energy performance measures put in place through
these contracts will generate savings for the next 20 years

   and campuses that consume the most energy by implementing energy
   performance contracts efficiency savings will only take us part way to the
   goal however renewable energy sources and new technologies will also
   need to be considered to successfully meet the goal

      the county received a 295000 grant from the illinois clean energy community foundation
      which will contribute to the countys continuing sustainability efforts by reducing reliance on
      gasfired units that heat the facilities where trucks and road equipment are stored the county
      will install solar walls at the cook county department of transportation and highway ccdoth
      maintenance facilities in des plaines orland park schaumburg and riverdale the solar thermal
      wall will directly convert the suns rays into thermal energy heating air and delivering it to
      indoor spaces the project is expected to save the county 47000 annually and reduce carbon
      dioxide emissions by 457 tons per year




the energy benchmarking ordinance
 in 2014 the cook county board of commissioners passed its firstever energy benchmarking ordinance the
benchmarking ordinance requires the county to track annual energy and water use of its buildings larger than 35000
square feet which accounts for 985 percent of the county portfolio the ordinance also requires that an annual report
be issued to show the benefits of benchmarking to the private sector and local governments in cook county

tracking a buildings energy use helps to understand its energy efficiency and is necessary for effective energy
management by identifying opportunities to improve performance and achieve financial benefits the county employs
the us epa free webbased benchmarking tool portfolio manager to track and assess energy and water consumption
across the entire portfolio of buildings benchmarking supports the presidents sustainability efforts by allowing
prioritization of investments and ability to track and disclose impacts

             greening information technology
 the cook county bureau of technology uses the technologies of green it to reduce the environmental
 footprint and the operational cost of systems architectures and processes as upgrades are made throughout
 the countys it infrastructure

 a modern data center power and air conditioning are the lifeblood of a data center computers
 transform power to heat dissipation so reducing the power consumed by the computers then efficiently
 cooling the rooms are key elements of a green strategy the modernized data center under construction on
 the 7th floor of the county building improves efficiency by increasing the equipment input voltages from 125
 to 208 volts as voltage increases less current is required so power consumption is reduced by 3 percent and
 less heat is generated by the equipment all enterprise server rooms are being fitted with 208 volt circuits for
 new equipment the corresponding reduction in equipment heat dissipation means the air condition systems
 use less power furthermore the modernized data center is designed with hot and cold aisles to improve air
 flow and cooling efficiency and will feature new air conditioning units that use less power finally the improved
 data center will have energy efficient lighting that consumes half the amount of power of old florescent fixtures

 decreasing the footprint of physical servers the bureau of technology is decreasing the footprint
 of physical servers through server virtualization and provisioning the space in a dynamic way in the past
 an individual physical server ran a single operating system and provided a platform for a limited number of
 applications data storage and administration space while this worked it left the physical server using a limited
 amount of its processing power the majority of the time the development of virtualizing technology allowed
 for a change of strategy now a single physical server can provide a platform for multiple virtual servers using
 the majority of the processing capacity at any time this allows the county to lower the number of physical
 servers it needs to provide the same level of service to the business while lowering energy use through fewer
 physical servers and effectively shrinks the footprint needed within the datacenter this strategy requires
 fewer servers reduces electronic salvage in the long term lowers the amount of space required in datacenters
 and reduces cooling energy consumption the sheriffs office has already completed 80 percent of its
 virtualization efforts through august of 2015 through server consolidation the county has reduced the space
 dedicated to servers by 3200 square feet

 countywide network switch replacement project cook county is refreshing all network
 switches throughout cook county and data centers these network switches are certified green with respects
 to power consumption and power efficiency these switches have a number of energy benefits

   1    they will only consume power that is required at that time thus providing a savings on overall
 		      consumption from energy providers
   2    the switches will shut down ports that are inactive thus reducing power consumption
   3    if switches have wireless products attached they will only transmit the signal when there is traffic
 		      this provides overall cost savings

 in 2014 in addition to replacing switches the bureau also reduced the number of switches in the downtown
 campus further decreasing energy demand

water                                     goal reduce water use 30 by 2025


under the green leadership team an energy and water subcommittee was formed and in 2014 began a labor
intensive task of establishing a system wide water use baseline the county has a complex facility structure with
over 200 buildings in the county portfolio and a number of agencies responsible for facilities and billing across the
county there was no centralized information about water cost or use establishing a baseline and analyzing costs is
particularly important because the county maintains two large 24 hour 365 day a year campuses corrections and
stroger hospital that have high water use intensity a centralized system and analysis will allow the county to identify
opportunities for efficiencies at these and other buildings
     the process of establishing a baseline included identifying where bills were being sent for each building the
number of meters at each building and whether bills were reporting estimated or actual usage
     the county is working with the city of chicago our largest water provider to install new meters which will
provide more accurate and timely usage data 36 of our 76 city of chicago water meters are being replaced although
establishing a true water baseline is still a work in progress the county has been able to identify a usage baseline
for approximately 85 of our square footage even before completing the baseline analysis attention to the issue of
water usage brought about the inclusion of water efficiency projects in the next round of energy efficiency capital
improvement projects




                          health and hospitals system
                         sustainability accomplishments
           1 increased lighting efficiency by upgrading lighting in the parking lots
              at clinics to led bulbs and installing timers at oak forest health center
           2 reduced copy paper use by 15 percent through default printing to
              twosided multifunctional devices and centralizing paper distribution to
              manage monitor and control usage
           3 increased recycling by 17 tons through incorporating cardboard and
              construction debris into the recycling stream
           4 decreased volume of regulated medical waste by 20000 pounds
              per month through audits and education

fleet                                     goal reduce emissions from fuel use 80 by 2050


after a 2013 review revealed increasing costs little centralized data and unnecessary emissions due to an aging fleet
the county commissioned a comprehensive fleet assessment the assessment led to the following recommendations
and actions


     centralize fleet management under a fleet manager a fleet manager is in place and an
		      updated fleet inventory has been completed


     select and implement an asset management system across all county fleets an asset
		      management system is planned for purchase in 2016


     rightsize the fleet with a study at the asset level and combine the residual vehicles
		      with a precision capital plan for the county the goal of the fleet reduction project is to
		      reallocate vehicles that are underutilized 10000 miles or less and place them in pool sharing programs or
		      distribute them to other departments as necessary vehicles 2007 or older would be eliminated and salvaged
		      the fleet inventory showed that there are currently 1880 active vehicles in the county fleet down from 2009
		      in 2014 the shared fleet program has three ford fusion hybrid vehicles and one ford focus electric vehicle
		      five new ford fusion hybrid vehicles have been ordered to replace four cars which are all over 10 years old

		      the vehicle steering committee is currently working with the bureau of finance to analyze vehicle usage
		      data and determine the right size of the fleet once established an ongoing steady state replacement cycle
		      will be established with a steady budget and be part of the annual county buying plan this would allow
		      the county to strategically source vehicles with the goal of standardizing the types of vehicles procured and an
		      emphasis on increasing hybrid and electric vehicles as part of the overall fleet limiting the type of vehicles
		      individual departments purchase will also assist the vehicle services department by allowing for the purchase
		      of parts in bulk quantity and keeping preventative maintenance costs low

		      the vehicle steering committee has set a goal of reducing the vehicle inventory by 20 percent or
		      approximately 200 vehicles realizing this goal will result in a conservative estimate of approximately 71420
		      gallons of less fuel used per year equaling 857 tons less of co2 the countys shared fleets as well as an
		      additional agreement with zipcar have both been in place since 2013


     consolidate the existing maintenance facilities into a new profile of two primary
		      county vehicle repair shops late this year all county vehicle maintenance will be consolidated under
		      the sheriffs office who will be utilizing a revitalized building in la grange park the sheriffs department
		      will handle all light duty preventative maintenance on county vehicles and serve as a goto center before
		      any major repairs are sent out to third party contractors all vehicles will be uploaded on central fleet
		      maintenance database to track maintenance fuel utilization and costs
