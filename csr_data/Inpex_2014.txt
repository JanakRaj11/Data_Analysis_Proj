                                     for social contribution programs too in abu dhabi i think that building relationships of trust that use
                                     facetoface contact is very important but even for these tasks the first step is being respected by

        are also contributing to nation building with respect to developing industries protecting the environment
        and providing education to the public for many years we have been involved in social contribution
        programs that reflect abu dhabis requests for assistance to perform these activities we place
        importance on building relationships rooted in trust with the people of abu dhabi interaction with the
        people of abu dhabi over many years has made us a presence that is synonymous with japan this is
        why people contact us with all types of requests related to japan by doing everything we can with                              yosuke ueda

the injection well once it has cooled electricity can be produced over long periods of time

                                                       carbon conversion by microbes

this research involves injecting co2 into the ground by using ccs or co2 eor for the purpose of producing methane ch4 by
methane microbes that live in oil and gas fields and waterbearing strata a constant supply of hydrogen is vital to the survival of
these microbes inpex has performed indoor experiments that use the power of electrochemical hydrogen reduction at this
stage the research has confirmed significant electrochemical methane production activation by microbes including the methane
microbes that exist in oil fields in japan

                            the inpex group established the medium to longterm vision in 2012 to define the groups goals for the
                            next decade while other companies only had about 3 year long mediumterm plans containing nothing
                            more than sales plans during the past two years it appears as though the group has been intently
                            focused on making steady progress toward its vision and has created a virtuous cycle furthermore i also
                            believe these activities will be very beneficial for engaging with institutional investors in 2014 the financial
                            services agency announced the japanese version of the stewardship code1 in europe esg
                            investments2 have increased to about half of all investments over the past several years while esg
                            investments in japan have been very limited as companies take actions in line with this new code these
                            investments are expected to grow dialogue between companies and institutional investors about esg will
                            probably increase in the future but this will most likely take a long time due to issues like the lack of esg
                            literacy among institutional investors around 2030 the operating environment for companies is expected
                            to be very different because of climate change global demographic shifts mineral resource shortages and
                            other trends this is why the group needs to begin thinking about what they want to accomplish in the
                            decade starting in 2030 by backcasting from its goal for 2050 i think that the group will be unable to
                            achieve many of their goals unless it starts taking actions now
                                 the group has established the inpex values but i am particularly impressed with how the diverse
                            values from a large number of cultures are visualized when incorporating creating shared value csv
                            into their corporate social responsibility csr management i hope that companies will not solely
                            consider the americanconcept of economic value but also adopts a csv perspective that includes a
                            broad spectrum of values
                                 it is not clear whether the csr committee which includes senior executives played a major role in the
                            identification of the key csr issues i think the report should have made this clear as i have just mentioned
                            above i am impressed with the groups extensive and steady progress on its numerous initiatives that are
                            based on the companys vision and plan regarding health safety and the environment hse i believe that
                            the group is advancing rapidly compared to a couple of years ago while it recognizes the necessity to
                            improve more to achieve top level hse initiatives however i want to see the group continue to improve
                            its activities because its hse performance is declining as the scale of its operations extends furthermore i
                            think the group needs to take more actions in response to its growing environmental impacts
                                 i am pleased to see that this report includes environmental social and corporate governance esg
                            information but there are still issues in general japanese companies are recognized to have insufficient
                            disclosure of corporate governance information for example most companies provide the required
                            organization chart however what is really needed is information about the ability of companies to sustain
                            growth this includes information like medium and longterm visions and policies the relationship between
                            nonfinancial data and longterm progress and the integration of financial and nonfinancial information
                                 incidentally the revisions of the eu accounting directives which i mentioned last year are in progress it is
                            certain that companies will be required to establish and disclose a diversity policy of the board of directors
                            disclosing this policy will be essential for inpex because of the large percentage of foreign shareholders
                            finally i would like to see more explanations of abbreviations and terminology used in the report

                            1 j apanese version of the stewardship code this term is used for the rules and guidelines contained in principles for
                              responsible institutional investors which was announced by japans financial services agency in february 2014 the subtitle is
                              investments and dialogues to achieve sustained growth at companies as of june 2014 127 institutional investors had
                              announced their support for this code
                            2 esg investments esg investing is an investment style that also places emphasis on the nonfinancial information related to the
                              environment society and governance in order to evaluate corporate value these investments are based on the belief that esg
                              is both a risk factor and a source of returns for longterm growth in corporate value esg can generally be regarded as
                              equivalent to csr

have again received extremely valuable inputs about our csr activities for example mr goto
suggested to set our goals in line with the constantly changing operating environment to
strengthen csr management while incorporating many different values to improve our hse
initiatives continuously to disclose the medium and longterm information as well as nonfinancial

diversity policy for driving our csr management
