helping childrens development while having fun


learning hygiene habits
for good health
in order for them to grow and develop healthily it is very important for children to acquire good hygiene habits from an
early age it is especially important for children to wash their hands frequently because the hands come into contact with all
sorts of materials and are used when eating in places like schools where children are engaged in communal activities it is
very easy for dirt and germs to spread from one person to another via contact between the hands and infected or dirty
surfaces to help tackle this problem kao has developed hand soap products that make it easy for even very small children
to get the dirt off their hands kao is also continuing to implement its program of visiting lessons where kao employees
visit schools to help children learn how to wash their hands properly by singing kaos original hand washing song




yokimonozukuri aimed at helping children to maintain good hygiene
in the past when washing their hands with conventional liquid
soap it was difficult for children to get their hands thoroughly
clean in 2004 kao launched a new type of hand soap
equipped with a foaming pump so that foam comes out just
by pressing the pump and which is weakly acidic so that it is
gentle on the skin since then kao has continued to improve
this product by introducing a new type of pump design that is
easy for childrens small hands to use and by modifying the
formulation so that it removes stubborn grease more
effectively
     however despite making this hand soap easy for children
to use kaos surveys of how children actually wash their
hands have shown that most children do not know how to
wash their hands thoroughly in response to these findings              even children can easily get foam onto every part of their
                                                                         hands
kao launched and has implemented its hand washing lesson
program since 2009 to teach children the correct method for
washing their hands

hand washing lessonskey points
learning the knack of washing
your hands properly through a song
to wash ones hands properly it is necessary to use soap and
spend at least 40 seconds washing every part of the hands
including the palm the back of the hand between the fingers
and the wrist kao created an original hand washing song with
lyrics that cover the six key points to remember when
washing your hands doing the corresponding actions while
singing the song can ensure that the hands get properly               learning the six key points
washed all over                                                      while singing the song
     this song is being publicized using animated films on the
kao website and posters the song is used in teaching by
schools social welfare facilities and hospitals to teach many
children about proper hand washing



getting the whole class to practice
the techniques
hand washing lessons are aimed at elementary school
students in the lower grades the lessons are taught at
around 100 schools every year during the lessons first
children learn about how important it is to wash your hands
and then they learn the correct method of washing hands by
singing the hand washing song in the practical activity
every child in the class has the whole of their hands covered
with a coating material that simulates dirt and then washes it
off by checking which parts of their hands are still dirty
afterwards the children are able to find out which parts of
their hands they tend not to wash properly having become
expert little hand washers the children can now teach their
family members and other people around them about the
correct technique for hand washing                                   a practical exercise where children learn the correct actions
     besides these lessons kao also provides teaching
materials so that teachers can strengthen childrens
awareness of the importance of washing hands properly
copies of these materials have been distributed to around
10000 schools representing roughly half of all elementary
schools in japan




participation by kao employees as
instructors
several employees from each company and division within the
kao group always participate in hand washing lessons as
instructors the idea is that during a period of just 45 minutes
employees must use actual products to give individual instruction
to each child and show them how keeping clean can be fun
     the kao employees who have taken part in hand washing
lessons as instructors feel that they get a lot out of the
experience in which they get to see childrens smiling faces
they note that providing people with products becomes even
more meaningful when they show people how to use those
products properly participation in the lessons helps employees
reflect on what yokimonozukuri that is useful to society really
means and on their own role in achieving this employees are
able to make use of what they have learned through participation      children returning to the classroom with clean hands highfive the
in hand washing lessons in their own workplaces                      kao employees acting as instructors

japan but also in other countries around the world
including taiwan thailand and indonesia in the future
kao will continue to promote widespread adoption of the
hand washing lesson concept with the aim of helping
even more children grow up healthily through good
hygiene practices

    childrens feedback

    kao receives letters of thanks and
    picture diaries from children at schools
    which kao employees visited to give
    handwashing lessons

    together with my brother and with
    mom  i am going to make sure i
    keep my hands really clean so i dont
    transmit any germs to other peoples
    hands
    we learned how to wash our hands
    properly i enjoyed singing the hand
    washing song im going to remember
    the song and use it when i get home




    comments from kao staff
    we will continue to make improvements to our
    products to make them easy for children to use
    gentle on childrens skin and effective in removing
    dirt
    i feel that the value of a product will increase when
    consumers are correctly informed about its function
    and how to use it as i see it hand washing lessons
    are a good way of putting this into practice for
    children

     comments from a school principal
     professor kazunori kawai principal of kaname elementary school toshima ward tokyo
     our school implemented this activity for the first time in 2016 i felt that this process of
     cleaning and reflecting provided a marvelous opportunity to get the children thinking
     about things from the perspective of the people who will be using them in the future
     and for inspiring a sense of gratitude in the children for the things and places that they
     have been using all this time and the people who have watched over them i intend to
     keep holding this activity at our school as a regular pregraduation activity every year




     comments from kao staff
     having launched this activity in 2016 at 135 schools by march
     2017 this figure had grown to 741 schools we will continue to
     work to promote this activity
     one of the great things about our cleaning sheets is that people
     can actually see for themselves that the sheets get things properly
     clean so they can really experience the pleasure of cleaning we
     want to see children enjoying themselves while they are cleaning

co2 emissions generated to heat the water therefore kao is        the rubber material by fusing kaos interface control technology
actively developing watersaving products that use less water       with bridgestones base material technology this innovation
including hot water and products able to achieve the same          improves fuel efficiency leading to lower co2 emissions and
level of performance at a lower water temperature in order to       improves grip performance on wet road surfaces

  kaos approach

kao believes that water management is necessary for the stability of manufacturing activities not only in
its own manufacturing activities but also at suppliers many kao products require water during use and
generate wastewater after use that flows into waterways therefore we are actively offering products
that require less water during use and generate wastewater with less impact on the environment

to be a risk to our business continuity and growth                       on the other hand continuously offering higher value
     to comply with these regulations we are proactively taking     environmentally friendly products and expanding the markets

  kaos approach

kaos business activities benefit in many ways from biodiversity in all productrelated cycles to continue
receiving these biodiversity benefits long into the future we must conserve biodiversity and use the
benefits without irreparably depleting them we therefore strive to reduce the impacts of our business
activities on biodiversity and conserve biodiversity in our social activities




social issues and kaos approach
palm oil is a principal raw material in kao products palm oil          the kaos biodiversity initiatives we have defined specific
offers the highest manufacturing efficiency of vegetable oils           targets and are working on a daily basis to achieve them
and is an indispensable raw material for humankind rainforest              these activities are aligned with the sdgs specifically
destruction is a major problem however and presents a key             goal 14 conserve and sustainably use the oceans seas and
opportunity for kao to make earnest efforts to conserve                 marine resources and goal 15 sustainably manage forests
biodiversity sustainable procurement of raw materials such as          combat desertification halt and reverse land degradation halt
palm oil paper and pulp is positioned as the highest priority in       biodiversity loss




policies
in 2010 we analyzed the risks involving biodiversity in our            the convention on biological diversity
business activities and held informationgathering interviews           for details refer to the basic policies on conservation of biodiversity
with 11 related divisions we also brought division                      and the action policies and introductions of activities
representatives together at workshops to identify risks and              httpwwwkaocomjpencorp_csreco_activities_03_04html
issues for the kao group and discuss countermeasures based
on the results of these activities we defined the basic policies       initiatives toward sustainable procurement
on conservation of biodiversity in 2011 in these policies we          of all palm oil
also pledge to comply with international agreements including           p 123 culture  sustainable and responsible procurement




structures
our policy and activities related to biodiversity are managed under the responsible care promotion system
p 183 responsible care activitiesstructures




education and promotion
from 2011 when we defined our basic policies on conservation           education including biodiversity topics for new employees
of biodiversity to 2012 we conducted elearning courses                   outside japan we are conducting educational activities on

as it reduces environmental impact one case in 2016 that                         co2 emissions by approximately 150 tons and saved
illustrates this is reducing the corrugated box materials in the                  approximately 100 million yen
new refill packaging which reduced co2 emissions by                                 in 2016 we reduced packaging materials for refill products
approximately 37 tons there were 14 cases like this in 2016                      and increased the unit sales of refill products to reduce our

in 2012 kao began to convert from petroleumbased resins to                      previous packaging
plantbased raw materials that are renewable and have little                         we will continue switching packaging to renewable raw
environmental impact introducing plantbased materials into                      materials such as biopolyethylene and polylactic acid
the refill packaging at this time involved switching about 10
of the container by weight from petroleumbased polyethylene
to biopolyethylene the biopolyethylene is made from
renewable ethanol obtained by fermenting the waste residue
remaining after producing sugar from intentionally cultivated
sugar cane this plastic is attracting attention due to its low
environmental impact the co2 emitted when the plastic is
incinerated is deemed zero
    in the label for healthya green tea 350 ml bottles we
adopted a shrink film containing more than 50 polylactic acid
pla made from corn
    in 2016 we newly switched to using biopolyethylene for
20 of the shampoo and conditioner packaging for the merit
essential asience and segreta series by weight this can
reduce the packagings co2 emissions by about 8 over the                        shampoo and conditioner packaging that switched to 20 biopolyethylene by weight

2009 when the kao environmental statement was released is            annual co2 emissions reduction of approximately 400 tons
approximately 500000 tons these activities in packaging
processes have reduced co2 emissions by approximately 45
million tons this not only reduces our environmental impact it
also contributes to reducing the attendant processing expenses
in collection and transportation intermediate processes final
disposal recycling and management savings in these social
costs come to approximately 17 billion yen
     in 2016 we developed a new refill packaging that is both
environmentally friendly and easy to use and adopted it in the
refill packs for all merit essential asience and segreta shampoo
and conditioner products this new packaging is used for the
refill packs of highly viscous products such as shampoos and
conditioners its film is about 18 thinner than existing
products and the pouring spout is made from about 50                 new refill packs

we actively introduce and use recycled materials such as
recycled paper and recycled resin we have been using
recycled paper in the cardboard boxes and instructional inserts
of many products since the 1960s including powdertype
laundry detergent the measuring spoon for attack laundry
detergent developed in 1987 uses recycled polypropylene
resin the dry sheet material used with the quickle wiper floor
cleaning tool launched in 1994 uses recycled pet material
    in 2016 we adopted an approximately 10 recycled pet
blend for the shampoo bottles in the asience meguri series

contest for children
basic approach
we have been holding the kao international environment
painting contest for children since 2010 with the wish of
expanding the concept of eco together around the world
children think seriously about the future of the earths
environment and steps we can take to conserve it in our daily
lives and then express their ideas in paintings which we
communicate to large numbers of people
    information communicated by children is thought to be
more influential in changing family behavior than information
communicated by the government companies or other outside
groups we believe that holding this contest not only in japan
but also in developing countries lacking environmental
education is essential
    in addition we believe that exhibiting the paintings in
cooperation with local governments and npos and not by kao
alone is more effective at raising environmental awareness                akira kobayashi won the eco together planet earth grand prix

  specific initiatives

       food services            total solution systems for hygiene                                                                       japan


                                management
in the food services sector kps implements measures to
enhance hygiene management and food poisoning prevention
    we provide total solutions that integrate products and
usage methods hardware with operational proposals
software and with education we implement these total
solution proposals through close collaboration with client
customers solution users

we work together with customers to build new hygiene
management systems using the following three steps

①exploring fundamental issues that are
 directly linked to food poisoning
we visit customers worksites to identify fundamental issues
that are directly connected to food poisoning including
personal hygiene food hygiene cleaning and disinfecting of
machinery and equipment and environmental sanitation                onsite verification and problem identification in a kitchen facility
     for example by examining how kitchens are laid out
kitchens are divided into a polluted work area a clean work
area and a quasipolluted work area how employees circulate
within the kitchen which relates to crosscontamination and
how food material crosscontamination prevention and
temperature management are implemented we are able to
identify issues that could potentially lead to food hygiene
incidents
     we also examine whether there are any issues that while
unlikely to lead directly to food poisoning could affect the
appearance of the facility such as the methods used to clean
glass surfaces tables etc

②proposing solutions for resolving
 identified issues
we suggest specific usage methods management methods
and procedures for tackling the issues that affect our               example of a cleanliness  sanitation manual
customers indicating clearly which products and methods
should be used to implement cleaning and disinfection
                                                                     number of food hygiene workshops held each year
effectively we try out the suggested methods onsite and
verify their effectiveness onsite tests and checks we make                       year                             no of workshops
any necessary changes to products or methods and onsite                            2012                                     174
testing is performed repeatedly until the best possible results
are achieved in these ways we use the pdca plando                               2013                                     207

to ensure that the solution content tailored to the needs of the
individual worksite and the testvalidated methods can be
implemented onsite consistently as standard operating
procedures we provide illustrated easytounderstand
manuals in addition by holding food hygiene seminars for the
people who will actually be performing the work we promote
ongoing enhancement of the overall level of food hygiene

kaos strengths and challenges from the perspective of an outside audit

while audit  supervisory board members do not have              results of these meetings
voting rights at meetings of the board of directors as              one of kaos current strengths is that its corporate
participants in these meetings we provide opinions based        philosophy the kao way has been instilled in each
on our duties as audit  supervisory board members              employee allowing kao to realize rational and swift
going beyond that we also offer opinions from our               decision making and giving it an exceptional ability to
perspective as law and accounting specialists and i feel        gather together groupwide strengths however i believe
that the board of directors places great value on such           kao faces a challenge in incorporating diversity into this
opinions in addition due to the equal number of inside         strength as it must employ a wellbalanced approach so
and outside members including audit  supervisory               as not to inhibit its ability to promptly gather groupwide
board members who participate in meetings of the board          strengths one aspect of diversity is promoting an active
of directors members of the board four inside three           role for female employees while i am currently the only
outside audit  supervisory board members two inside          woman active on the board of directors two of kaos
three outside as well as the fact that the chairman of the     executive officers are female and kao is nurturing female
board of directors is an outside director outside               employees who could likely become their successors
members are able to actively make proposals at meetings          accordingly i believe that kao is making solid efforts to
of the board of directors and the company takes the             promote the active role of female employees i have high
opinions of the outside members very seriously also            hopes that kao will become a company where an even
meetings are often held between only outside members            more diverse group of human capital including women
where we candidly exchange opinions and                         can play an active role
