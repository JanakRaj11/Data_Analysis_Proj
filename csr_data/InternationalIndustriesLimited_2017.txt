is it fair to all concerned will it
build goodwill and better friendships
will it be beneficial to all concerned

these questions held particular
fascination for me as a business man
and as a man throughout my life i
have asked these questions of myself
and i have come to believe that to
answer them in the affirmative is to
achieve not only success in life but
fulfillment

having pulled myself by my boot
straps i acquired rugged individuality
a fearless independence of spirit
but to be able to do so i had first to
put my house in order and make sure
that our organization measured up to
modern standards of efficiency we
selected the right men for the right
jobs and delegated responsibility to
them above all we maintained a high
standard of ethics in our business
dealings and built up a reservoir of
good will for our firm from which we
were able to draw time and again

history of the chinoy group

founded by mr amir s chinoy international industries limited iil was incorporated in pakistan in 1948 as
sir sultan chinoy  co ltd  a trading company which primarily dealt with electronic instruments in 1952 iil
sponsored the setting up of pakistan cables ltd in partnership with bicc plc uk thereafter iil became the
selling agent for pakistan cables ltd

it wasnt till 1966 that iil started producing cold rolled tube for electrical conduit and steel furniture mr towfiq
h chinoy took over the company as managing director in 1977 and fairly quickly started diversifying the
product range by manufacturing galvanized iron gi pipe in 1982 in 1984 iil was listed on the karachi stock
exchange and such was the reputation of the company that when shares were offered to the public the offer
was oversubscribed 67 times

during the years that followed the company lived up to its reputation and continued to grow quite rapidly in
1989 iil set up pakistans first private sector cold rolling mill and started diversifying its steel pipe size and
thickness production to fulfill the demands of pakistans booming industry and economy iil pipe exports which
began in 1996 have now grown to cover 60 countries across all 6 continents

in 2006 iil recognized a gap in the market and entered the plastic pipe domain by setting up extrusion plants
for high and medium density polyethylene pipes and has now extended its range up to 1600 mm diameter
hdpe pipe and lately to include pprc pipes and fittings the company has continued to pursue new markets
and incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in australia in 2014 this was followed by the establishment of
stainless steel pipe manufacturing facilities in 2015 and the setting up of a 12 diameter tube mill to produce api
line pipes and hollow structural sections hss in 2016

international steel limited isl was incorporated in 2007 with the vision to be the foremost manufacturer of
flat steel products in pakistan at the time isl was the largest private investor in the valueadded flatrolled and
coated steel industry in the country the 165 million investment with equity contributions from iil sumitomo
corporation jfejapan and the international finance corporation a division of the world bank bought added
impetus and confidence in the engineering and hitech manufacturing segment in country iil owns 56335
of the share capital of isl

isl continues to grow and diversify its business initially isl was capable of producing 180000 mt hot dipped
galvanized coil hdgc and 250000 cold rolled coil crc in 2015 isl set up a line to produce 84000 tons
per annum of color coated galvanized coils ppgi

isl added a second galvanizing line in 2016 and enhanced its galvanizing hdgc capacity to 462000 mt a
second stand on the rolling mill was added in 2016 upgrading isls crc capacity to 550000 mt currently isl
is in the process of doubling its capacity to over 1 million mt by setting up another cold rolling mill

inspired by its past the group remains committed to growing its businesses in an ethical and sustainable
manner




                                                                       group sustainability report 2017             9

group values and culture

the chinoy group has a rich history that consists of a diversified group of businesses in this report we are
focusing on two integral organizations of the chinoy group international industries limited iil and international
steels limited isl

our group believes that steel is a good measure of the progress of an economy the steel consumption in
pakistan currently hovers around 40 kg per capita compared to a world average of over 200 kg per capita
therefore we believe there is considerable potential for growth in the domestic steel industry as such it has
been our groups mission to continue to enhance output and propagate the use of steel in all forms by producing
quality products that are sold at lower margins for this reason we integrated backwards and set up isl to
assist with the provision of raw materials for the pipe production process

although our organizations differ from an operational perspective our environmental impacts are similar due to
processing of our core raw material of steel

our organizations have several interdependencies which are shared through our support services and our
head office teams as a result the synergies between these two organizations have led us to create this group

circular economy



iil and isl are proud to promote the global phenomenon of circular economy international companies
throughout the world are pledging their sustainability practices to a circular economy this means that an
organization makes an effort to close the loop of a product lifecycle through greater recycling and reuse as
a result waste is recognized as a resource not utilizing the finite resources we believe that by focusing on
this philosophy we are in fact capitalizing on missed business opportunities by reselling and recycling our
waste products moreover this process promotes the process of durable design to preserve and extend the
utility value of the product by increasing the durability of the product there is less need by the end user our
customer to replace and dispose of our products




        raw materials

environmental impacts

as the core business of iil and isl is the production process our group has a large impact on our environment
as pakistan faces energy and clean water scarcity issues we believe that our most direct and visible impacts
come from our environmental efficiencies as responsible corporate citizens we have broken down our
environmental impacts for both organizations

although our primary raw materials steel and zinc do not have a direct impact on our environment our group
strongly believes in minimizing environmental damage that might result from any of our production processes
most of the technologies and equipment in our operations are environmentally efficient and compliant with
international and national norms environmental aspects are taken into consideration by us and included in all
our project costing and purchase process furthermore all future investments are preceded by an environmental
impact assessment

production process  impacts incurred
to sum up we have a brief outline of production processes that will assist in the understanding of the types of

waste management
as part of our belief in the circular economy we intend to minimize our waste and maximize the recycling of our
steel any byproducts created as a result of the manufacturing process are also disposed of in a responsible
manner

the table below illustrates the types and amounts of wastes produced in the last fiscal year for both organizations
furthermore this table identifies when the waste is produced and how it is disposed of

                                    both iil and isl have set up effluent treatment plants that treat and
                                     neutralize hydrochloric acid before it is released into the drainage
                                     system this ensures that we avoid the contamination of water

                                     manufacture of red oxide paint



note the plastics pipe production process is more waste efficient and has minimal material wastes any
plastic not utilized in the production stage is grinded and put back into the production process




                                                                     group sustainability report 2017             33

finished goods and delivery
our finished goods also reflect the values of the circular economy both iil and isl create durable products that
have an extended life in comparison to some of our competitors this causes a reduction in the waste process
through our products lifetime

an efficient supply chain network is required to help minimize our environmental impacts moreover the delivery
of items is an integral step to ensuring satisfied customers the final part of the supply chain ensures constant
management of finished goods storage and delivery throughout pakistan

    in the last year iil created a warehouse in sheikhupura storage and delivery to the northern areas of
     pakistan this decreased the lead time required to deliver our products furthermore access to a warehouse
     facility allows us to optimize our deliveries to the north

    as our customer base in punjab increases isl is also looking to increase our warehousing facilities in the
     near future

iils corporate offices have also taken an initiative to reduce their environmental impact daily work processes
utilize the oracle e business suite system which increases efficiency and reduces unnecessary paper waste

moreover both iil and isl believe that greenery creates a healthy workspace and clean breathing spaces that
our visually pleasant as such both organizations have planted a green belt outside the boundary wall of all their
factories and have also ensured that greenery is planted at regular intervals all over the factory premises just in
the last year iil alone planted almost 300 plants and trees outside our factory premises furthermore both iil
and isl have also made a concerted effort to plant and maintain greenery both inside and outside all its office
locations

                                                                        group sustainability report 2017            35

please note that the total number of employees at iil includes full time employees apprentices and contractual
employees furthermore there are a few departments that provide shared services to both organizations they
include corporate and legal affairs business planning information technology marketing and administration




talent acquisition
our group is driven by our ethical code of conduct that encourages a fair work place furthermore we amended
our recruitment policies in the last year to further promote gender race and religionbased discrimination

the hrd has also aligned job specifications with the management to ensure transparency through the
recruitment process and to decrease inefficiencies



diversity
as part of an industrial business our head count has historically and culturally been predominantly male it
is more difficult to hire women in the factories due to the nature of the location the limited access of public
transportation for women and the governmental timing restriction of femalebased factory workers
 at iil the hrd has been strongly working on enhancing diversity and has hired approximately 6 females in
   the last year in our head offices in karachi and lahore

 at isl there are currently 3 female members in our team and are continuing to work towards hiring more
  within our management and leadership team

employee engagement
our hrd is truly focused on ensuring that our employees are assimilated in our culture

 our group organized team events that for management staff and their families of iil and isl in lahore and
  islamabad this event was a testament of appreciation by our senior leadership for our teams hard work

 special attention has been given to improving the work spaces of the iil head office and factory in the past
  year the increasing demands of the business required our head count to increase significantly in the past
  few years iil acquired additional office space to create open and healthy working environments canteen
  areas were improved in the north office and gym facilities were added to factory 1

 last year the hr team at both organizations conducted an anonymous employee survey once completed
  the hr team did a thorough subjective and objective assessment to create a presentation with the survey
  results the hr team held department wise meetings in which positive and negative feedback of the
  employees was discussed and corrective action taken included introduction of flexible working hours and
  two weekly saturday holidays at the office locations this process will now be conducted regularly as it has
  led to increased levels of motivation in management staff furthermore there has been an organic growth
  of grass root team initiatives such as companywide lunches twice a month and the sharing of beneficial tips
  through email at isl




health and safety
the health and safety of our employees is of massive significance to us we are responsible for providing a
healthy and injury free environment for our employees and contractors and both iil and isl strives to achieve
this through our ohse management system occupational health safety and environment system that is
implemented by the hse department

through this program we have set reporting parameters that minimize the impact of behaviors that could lead
to unfavorable events our hse program also enhances the sense of responsibility for keeping the workplace
safe and with minimal or no hazards for example the team has created signage that includes large clear
illustrations that are placed throughout the factory floor employees are additionally enforced to wear personal

protective equipment such as helmets safety gloves safety goggles and ear protectors and are required to walk
along designated safety pathways in the factory premises a factory based employee doing specialized tasks
can only conduct their task if they receive permits to work to ensure they are knowledgeable of the task and
the controls and hazards that come with the job




our hse departments at iil and isl have created several unique incentive programs that have encouraged the
implementation and understanding of such practices here are some of the traditional and creative ways to how
we promote such activities

 a     implementation of a safety award system where 10000 pakistani rupees is awarded to employees
 		     that give suggestions for improvement take ownership of their work and identify potential risks by
 		     taking a precautionary approach
 b     development of a fresh eye observation program in which the management conduct regular site
 		     visits and collaborate with the local teams to observe safety issues and concerns when safety issues
 		     and work behavior is acknowledged the management rewards and commends those relevant team
 		     members
 c     conducting of a monthly safety appraisal of contractors to ensure their hse activities are aligned with
 		     iils
 d     involvement of senior management through monthly safety presentations visibility of the leadership
 		     instills a sense of health and safetys significance
 e     facilitation of personal protective equipment within the factory staff through policies that enforce the
 		     employees to wear protective gear to ensure safety while our factory workers handle molten metal
 		     electric wires and other chemical substances and gases




                                                                   group sustainability report 2017          41

trainings
preventative action is the core essence of safety and helps ensure that factory floor injuries do not occur or are
kept to a minimum preventative action can be achieved by training our employees about health and safety
rules and measures because of its significance basic safety induction is mandatory for all new hires in their
local languages

iil
furthermore over 45 inhouse sessions were conducted for 657 employees on various technical topics including
technical trainings 66 employees attended external local  foreign programs arranged by various wellreputed
institutes including harvard business school picg and iba along with others

during the year our employees were imparted a total of 585 health and safety trainings ohse trainings included
safe crane operations hands safety fire fighting operations permit to work system industrial hazards first

health
health is the basic foundation of all life as a responsible corporate citizen we recognize that there are limitations for
underprivileged members of society and their reach to quality healthcare our donation policy supports the provision of

  iil factory 1 in the industrial area landhi where there was a need for immediate health care especially in an area where
  work injuries have a high probability to occur

last decade over 11000 children have gained a higher quality of education


education for the underprivileged

    himayati goth school at landhi tcf is a leading organization that assists children from less privileged areas to get an
    education in the tcf  iil school children are given a high quality of education along with an emphasis on personal
    and moral traits furthermore the curriculum promotes not only theoretical learning but promotes a wellbalanced
    learning experience through art sport and other creative activities in 2003 the school started operating in the
    afternoon shift as well we have been maintaining the operational expenses of this school since inception and
    currently the school has an operational capacity utilization of 104 just in the last year we had almost 400 students
    attend primary education at the tcf chinoy campus so far over 5500 students have been educated at this
    campus

   2003 our focus is in not only on external stakeholders but our internal members of our team as well iil has had an in

social welfare
the wellbeing of our society at large is also of great significance to us our donations are geared towards development of
rural or local communities

   2002  our group constructed the siddiqia mosque for the ease of our and neighboring factory workers to perform
    prayers it is located close to the factory 1 iil tcf school and the sina clinic to help facilitate the community we
    have been expanding this mosque continuously over the years and currently it has a capacity of accommodating

    part of tharparkar sindh this project provided clean water to 20 local households and approximately 150 people
    in an underprivileged community with limited access to water the installation of three more hand pumps is currently
    underway




                              prevention of unethical activities
       as part of the organizations policy and code of conduct we are strong supporters of an ethical workplace and
      work processes iil has implemented several policies to protect its financial and intellectual policies furthermore
     the approval framework in iil also inhibits the mishandling of financial checks for example the management is also
      deeply involved in daily business processes that as a result discourages any negative actions that may impact the
                                                          organization

      both iil and isl are strong supporters of human rights we do not permit the use of child or forced labors in any of
     our factories we validate all new hires ages through their government records and ensure fair pay practices to all the
                                                 employees in the organization




social impact goals
   introduce tangible and measurable kpis department and individualwise this will ensure that our internal efforts are
    even further aligned with the organizations objectives
   implement a stronger training program that expands beyond technical training into personal and career development
   develop internal communication mechanisms to further drive the goal of the organization
   improve long term employee retention by continuing to cultivate a positive culture and implement policies
   increase the number of hours of health and safety training required
   externally we would like to diversify and increase the reach of our donations to more people in need
