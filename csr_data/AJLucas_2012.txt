our expertise has
received growing
recognition in an
increasingly resource
constrained economy
and environmentally
conscious society



projects recently undertaken include the mayfield to
broadmeadow waste water upgrade as well as connection
to mains sewerage of rural communities in robertson
located in the southern highlands of new south wales
kangaroo valley and the towns of burringbar and mooball
located in the tweed valley of northern new south wales
works undertaken on these projects include the installation
of an advanced wastewater treatment system also known
as a membrane bioreactor with a consequent reduction in
pollution risk to the local drinking water catchment area


telecommunications
the maraislucas joint venture is also enjoying increasing
recognition for its network installation capability particularly
for the ultra fast broadband ufb fibre optic roll out in new
zealand where it has been selected as a preferred supplier
to chorus one of four companies contracted to implement
the ufb roll out capable of installing upwards of 400 metres
per day with minimal surface disturbance maraislucas
recently completed 10km of trenching connecting
over 600 homes
the maraislucas microtrenching capability is also gaining
increasing recognition in australia the company has
recently been awarded a 25km project by etsa for the
installation of fibre optic cable at mt gambier in south
australia the company will shortly take delivery of a
specialist trencher capable of simultaneously cutting the
trench feeding in the pipe or fibre optic and backfilling in
one pass this creates much less surface disturbance causes
less disruption to passing traffic and considerably decreases
delivery time

     cuadrilla
     analysis of the flow
     data from fracks
     conducted in april and
     may 2011 suggests the
     very large hydrocarbon
     resource currently
     estimated at 200tcf
     will most probably flow
     at commercial rates
                                                                      cuadrilla has also used this period to appoint new senior
                                                                      management with considerable energy resource experience
     cuadrilla experienced a challenging year as government          and to carry out further detailed analysis of the bowland
     regulation impacted its ability to move ahead with projects      basin the appointment of new managers in the cuadrilla
     at lancashire                                                   is aimed at strengthening leadership and enabling them to
                                                                      build a fit for purpose company
     limited progress was made during the year to confirm the
     reserves within the bowland basin due to suspension of
     fracking throughout the period
     despite this continued preparatory work was carried out
     in anticipation of the uk department of energy and climate
     change decc allowing the resumption of fracking at some
     stage wells at grange hill no 1 and becconsall no 1 were
     completed and another well has been spudded at annas
     road an application has also been made to drill a horizontal
     well at annas road the completed wells encountered
     much thicker shale in excess of 3000 feet than originally
     anticipated
     a 3d seismic program over 125 sq km of the north and north
     west part of the bowland basin has been undertaken and
     will provide further scientific evidence to unlock the basins
     geological secrets
     analysis of the limited flow data from fracks conducted in
     april and may 2011 suggests the very large hydrocarbon
     resource currently estimated at 200tcf gas in place will
     most probably flow at commercial rates however further
     fracking of the wells is required to more fully estimate the
     size and commercial viability of this resource
     assuming permission is granted to recommence hydraulic
     fracturing of the wells cuadrilla has proposed a number of
     checks and balances to mitigate and manage seismic activity
     fracture gradients water management traffic control and
     ensure stateoftheart best practice methodology in
     proving up what could be a very significant resource which
     may change the socioeconomic prospects of lancashire

the overall level of key management personnel compensation has been constrained due to the performance of the group over
a number of years no new incentivebased remuneration was granted during the year
with the exception of two modest bonuses paid in rights there has been no performancerelated remuneration for kmp during
the 201112 year these bonuses took account of the performance of the individuals during the year
given that company performance has been disappointing it is considered by the board to be appropriate that most executives
did not receive any bonus and the amounts received by the two executives who did were considered nominal

in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss for the group


cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
a change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increaseddecreased equity and profit or loss
by 2990865 for the group 2011 1619092 this analysis assumes that all other variables in particular foreign currency rates
remain constant the analysis is performed consistently from year to year

     the following methods and assumptions are used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments
       loans and borrowings and finance leases ð present value of future principal and interest cash flow discounted at the market
       rate of interest at the reporting date
       trade and other receivables and payables ð carrying amount equals fair value


     capital management the board policy is to maintain a capital base so as to maximise shareholder returns having regard also
     to the need to maintain investor creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business the board seeks
     to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and
     security afforded by a sound capital position the groups target is to achieve a return on capital of between 12 and 16
     in comparison the weighted average interest expense on interestbearing borrowings excluding liabilities with imputed interest
     was 876 2011 106
     the boards target is for employees excluding directors of the group to hold 4 of the companys ordinary shares by 2014
     at present employees hold approximately 25 of the companys ordinary shares or just under 3 assuming that all outstanding
     share rights vest and are exercised management is considering structures for extending the groups employee share schemes beyond
     key management and other senior employees
     subsequent to balance date shareholders have approved a placement of shares to kerogen to raise 30 million and the exercise
     of options over shares in the company by kerogen for a further 10 million in aggregate raising 40 million in new equity
     for the company refer to note 40 for further details

the different levels have been defined as follows
  level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
 level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly
					 ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices
  level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs

a loss after income tax of 1102 million during the year ended 30 june 2012 and as of that date the groups current liabilities
exceeded its current assets by 1310 million
these conditions along with other matters set forth in note 2c indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which
may cast significant doubt about the groups ability to continue as a going concern and therefore the group may be unable
to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business without the ongoing financial support of kerogen
as a substantial shareholder and financier the successful refinancing of the groups anz financing facility the achievement
of forecast profits and cash flows and the ability to access sufficient financing andor dispose of assets if and when required
