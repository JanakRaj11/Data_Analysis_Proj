as a lifelong peninsula resident i understand
the important role our bus paratransit and
shuttle services play in maintaining our quality
of life and sustaining the economic vitality
of our region serving over 40000 riders
each day in san mateo county samtrans is
committed to supporting a more sustainable
region by providing affordable accessible
environmentallyfriendly mobility options to
move people where they live work and play

corporate responsibility is vital for any
organization especially one impacting
thousands of riders and hundreds of buses
a day its sustainability programs must focus
both on its own operational impacts on the
environment as well as promoting a similar
ethic within its customers and communities
i recognize the importance of samtrans
sustainability efforts to help improve air
quality within the bay area

in fy2017 samtrans elected to participate in a community choice energy program that will provide samtrans
facilities with electricity from 100 percent renewable sources such as solar wind and geothermal in addition
the samtrans boardadopted fy2017 capital budget includes investment in a pilot program to procure operate
and maintain samtrans first fullyelectric buses both actions will reduce pollution and climatechanging
emissions within the bay area

i am pleased to share this sustainability report which summarizes our performance between fy2010 and
fy2016 highlights key accomplishments and identifies planned initiatives

sincerely

  this sustainability inventory and report focuses specifically on the facilities fixedroute bus paratransit and shuttle services under the
operational control of samtrans this inventory also includes indicators for nonrevenue vehicles and employee commuting across all three district
units due to overlapping roles the district has prepared a separate sustainability inventory and report for caltrain operations that does not include
either nonrevenue vehicles or employee commuting to avoid doublecounting

employee commuting
employee commuting vmt and associated ghg and criteria air pollutant emissions were calculated for the sake of
completeness as shown in figure 3 above employee commute contributes approximately 5 percent of total samtrans
ghg emissions however because of data limitations several important assumptions apply for any samtrans employee in
fy2016 emissions were estimated based on the anonymized zip code for each employee
the total number of employees per work location were provided for certain years and used to interpolate values for
remaining years furthermore it is assumed that all employees were employed full time and the vehicle mix was based on a
regionaverage vehicle mix from the california air resources boards emission factor database emfac 2014 the american
community survey acs was used to estimate the share of employees who drive in single occupancy vehicles carpool and
take alternative modes such as transit walking or biking according to a the 2014 acs 657 percent of bay area residents
drive alone and 99 percent carpool acs 2014 for samtrans the actual percentage of employees driving personal
vehicles may be lower due to the agencys transitoriented workforce and headquarters located in close proximity to transit
stations in the future samtrans may choose to use an employee commute survey to improve the agencys estimate
