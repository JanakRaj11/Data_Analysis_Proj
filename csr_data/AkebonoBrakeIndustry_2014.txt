    fellow members barriers gradually dissolved now we are able to                          eventrelated suggestions from their coworkers our activities
    identify sticking points and smoothly reach consensus                                    have come to involve an evergrowing number of associates
    okada having struggled for a while we eventually made a break
    through building a stronger sense of unity with an eye to holding
    the ceremony on april 1 2014 despite this after discussions with
    top management we had to reschedule the date of the ceremony
    although this was extremely discouraging on april 1 2014 the
    aicity headquarters held a kickoff event to herald the fiscal
    year in which we are celebrating the 85th anniversary each of our
    production bases also held a similar event on their own initiative
    looking back i think the rescheduling was the right decision
    because we had not yet succeeded in getting anyone other than
    the project members involved in our activities

     to mark the 85th anniversary we produced poloshirts designed in collaboration with

                                                                                            team provided me with a chance to develop the skills needed to
     akebonos 85th anniversary symbol are printed on the chest                            understand a wide variety of viewpoints this in turn helped to

     however that the commemorative events will help all of them hope                      with my supervisors as well as senior and junior colleagues
     for an even brighter future
     shirata i feel that not every job assignment directly benefits
     someone or something and i assume other associates feel the
     same way i happen to believe however that it is important to
     focus on the positive aspects of any job assignment no matter the
     type of task to be done frankly speaking until i joined the project
     i had little interest in the 85th anniversary events however as i
     became more engaged in this project rather than passively waiting
     to do what i am told i came to adopt a more proactive approach
     to all my work im glad that i was given a chance to think about
     my duties and the companys future more proactively
     ono looking back on my preproject working life i can see i was
     letting myself be swamped by daytoday concerns overwhelmed
     i couldnt see into the future any further than a year or two and
     thinking about how my career might develop over the years until
     retirement was impossible since joining the project however i
     have developed a more forwardthinking approach specifically
     even as i celebrate the 85th anniversary i am able to cast an eye
     toward the centennial to come and have developed a vision of how                           toward our centennial
     my career should look 15 years from now i have broken this vision                         looking 15 years into the future
     down into small shortterm goals for six months from now a year
     two years five years and so forth this also allows me to determine                   imaizumi i want akebono to become a company with an even
     monthly targets thanks to the project i have become far more                         more ambitious corporate culture i would like to see the company
     proactive and now enjoy tackling daily operations                                    growing and evolving into a manufacturer that surprises and inspires
     sakuma of course organizing project activities often involves                        users by creating innovative products utilized in every aspect of
     addressing challenging problems but organizing a major event is a                     daily life and business even in places where you least expect it in
     rare and invaluable experience moreover i was positively affected                    15 years ill be only five years from retirement nevertheless i wish
     by my fellow project members who are brilliant forwardthinking                      to grow as a person in unison with the company the project
     and highly motivated what i have learned from them is priceless                      enabled me to adopt a new approach toward work as i engaged

     1 the scope of calculation for environmental preservation costs includes the following 11 bases yamagata fukushima miharu tatebayashi iwatsuki sanyo acw including purchasing
        rd sections including airing production engineering sections alocs and the rd centre
     2 environmental preservation costs are the amount spent for such activities as operation and maintenance of environment preservation facilities
     3 value of investment is amount invested on introduction of environment preservation facilities
     4 values indicated in subtotal of environmental preservation costs in fiscal 2011 differ from the actual sum of costs for the respective years due to rounding

appropriately the status of depreciation of group facilities which are expected to operate more stably due to the introduction of nextgeneration facilities boasting greater versatility
    compared with calculations under the previous method operating income for fiscal 2013 showed an increase of 1433 million while ordinary income and income before income
