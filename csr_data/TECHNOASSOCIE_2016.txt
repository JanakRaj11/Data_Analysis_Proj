the use of electricity and gasoline by techno associe accounts for                                   techno associe strives to save energy by turning off lights during
about 97 of the companys total co2 emissions we are therefore                                     employee break times keeping air conditioners set at reasonable
focusing on reducing the use of these                                                               temperatures and holding no overtime days to encourage work
     our target for fiscal 2015 was to reduce co2 emissions by 1                                    efficiency
over the previous fiscal year and to this end we switched to led                                          our target for fiscal 2015 was to reduce electricity consumption
lighting and made work processes more efficient in order to save                                     by 1 over the previous fiscal year and thanks to replacing
electricity we also reduced the number of company cars and                                          mercury lamps with 353 led lights in warehouses at five bases we
switched them to more fuelefficient vehicles as a result of these                                  were able to reduce electricity consumption by 258600 kwh
aggressive efforts emissions were 14869 tons down 126 over                                     overall electricity consumption was down by 374900 kwh down
the previous fiscal year easily meeting our target we are aiming for                              112 over the previous fiscal year of which 77 comes from
a 2 emissions reduction in fiscal 2016                                                             switching to led lighting we are continuing to install led lighting

                                  example of occupational safety and health activities
                                  our overall action plan is based on techno associes companywide
                                  occupational safety and health implementation plan and report at the
                                  kyushu office we follow the 5s principle sort set in order shine
                                  standardize and sustain for example employees keep their desks clean and
                                  leave no documents out when they leave the office in the distribution center
                                  we work with partner companies to conduct 5s and safety patrols all
                                  employees take part in occupational safety and health activities in which we
                                  come up with and implement concrete measures to deal with problems we
                                  also work to reduce risk for example box cutters are used frequently in the
    chikara imafuku               warehouse and employees have gotten incision wounds in the past in
    facility management           response we have switched to safety cutters and created unified safety
    representative               standards for performing cutting work these efforts will of course benefit the
    kyushu office
                                  kyushu office but i believe that via the hr  administration department they
                                  will also contribute to reducing risk throughout all of techno associe
