     shinetsu chemical has adopted a midterm target of reducing greenhouse
     gas emissions intensity to 50 of the 1990 level by 2015


     shinetsu chemical has adopted the two midterm environmental targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity1 to                                                                      for the group in 2011 was 658 of the 1990 level which represents an increase on the 2010 level this was a result of
     50 of the 1990 level by 2015 and of realizing zero emissions landfill waste 1 or less of all waste generated by 2015                                                                     the damage sustained in the great east japan earthquake at some production plants and a fall in production volume and

        in 2011 our greenhouse gas emissions intensity was reduced to 606 of 1990 levels this outcome was achieved through                                                                     production volume increased

     due to process improvements the entire group has been making similar efforts however the greenhouse gas emissions intensity                                                                in such areas as hydrochloric acid recovery cellulose recycling waste treatment facilities and effective use of waste products
