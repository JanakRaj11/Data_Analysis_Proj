                                  began planning for the replacement of our rooftop solar array at our cambridge headquarters
                                  continued our robust csa and composting programs and renovated our new oakland office
                                  with sustainable biobased and recycled materials

                                  in the years that follow we look forward to building on these achievements and seeing
