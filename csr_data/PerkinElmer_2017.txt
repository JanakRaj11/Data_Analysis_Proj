20162017 corporate social responsibility report

i am proud to share our seventh annual corporate social
responsibility report reflecting on last years achievements
as well as those to date in 2017 sustainability is one of the
cornerstones of our mission of innovating for a healthier world
and we continue to look for creative ways to increase our
sustainable impact while also enhancing our volunteerism
several highlights from across our three pillars include

 community impact evolving our volunteer efforts to bring
  employees together across the globe on one designated day
  reinforcing the true impact of our work our contributions in 2016
  included helping local organizations pack sort and distribute over
  25000 pounds of food to families in need and removing over
  two tons of garbage from rivers beaches and parks

 ecoinnovative products collaborating internally to advance
  how we design and develop new products to minimize health
  and environmental impacts for instance our recently launched
  avio 200 icpoes which is used for multielemental
  inorganic analysis has the lowest argon consumption of any icp on the market

 sustainable and ethical business practices brainstorming novel ways to conserve water and energy around the
  world in 2016 we reduced carbon emissions from fleet vehicles by 8 compared to the previous year

on perkinelmers inaugural impact day i witnessed firsthand the passion of our employees who participated in an
activity at our seer green uk site in support of the british heart foundation we filled 50 bags of items for their
charity shops during the bag it beat it event the proceeds from the bags sold helped fund research to improve
the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease

whether through these kinds of charitable endeavors or through strategic partnerships and customer relationships
we connect with likeminded organizations that complement our expertise resources and reach to make the
greatest impact by working together we have the profound potential to solve some of the most significant societal
challenges its because of our employees who are supported by a work environment that encourages them to be
at their best that these goals are possible

we also find inspiration at perkinelmer in our legacy of helping improve lives over the past eight decades while
looking back on our incredible achievements and breakthroughs over the years we also look ahead to the future the
issues impacting health and the world around us have become more complex while we continue to innovate for our
customers to help them address these challenges it is also more important than ever before that we do our part to
meet these needs within our communities
