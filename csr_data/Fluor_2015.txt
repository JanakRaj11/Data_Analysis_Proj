fluor as the managing partner of the denver transit partners dtp concession is responsible for the financing design construction testing and
commissioning as well as operations and maintenance of the 36mile 60kilometer electrified eagle p3 publicprivate partnership commuter
rail network for the regional transportation district rtd in denver colorado

in december 2014 new commuter rail cars arrived from hyundai rotems assembly plant in philadelphia pennsylvania the cars were brought to
denvers union station for an open house and ribbon cutting ceremony where more than 6500 people toured them and the renovated station
among the visitors was john barr who uses a motorized wheelchair due to cerebral palsy three years ago using a mockup of the car barrs input
led to design changes that make it easier for disabled riders to use the commuter rail system

although denvers union station was not part of the denver rail project it was renovated and reopened in 2014 and will be the hub for all
commuter rail lines in 2016 as part of the denver rail project the station includes a new hotel restaurants and shops and also encourages multi
modal transportation use with an underground bus concourse and lightrail station all within a block of one another

                        to lower the osha total recordable incident rate increase communication about and trust in safety measures for
