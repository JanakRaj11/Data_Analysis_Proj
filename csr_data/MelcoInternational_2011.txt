        corporate social responsibility report 2010

message from group chairman  ceo
as a good corporate citizen melco has a strong commitment to corporate social responsibility csr
we firmly believe that we can contribute to a more sustainable future for the communities in which we
operate our stakeholders and most importantly for the many generations who will follow us

thanks to the collective efforts of our ngo partners and our amazing staff volunteers our csr programs
have produced very encouraging results more than 170 staff volunteers participated in over 30 programs
in 2010 benefiting over 16000 people in need

the importance of maintaining a sustainable environment is something all of us at melco recognize
one of the major steps we took in this direction during the year was the implementation of wwfs low
carbon office operation program starting in the third quarter of 2010 we have begun measuring the
carbon usage in our offices with the aim of reducing our longterm carbon emissions we also continued
our donations to the community chest melco green fund for the third year in a row

i am proud to say that melcos commitment to corporate social responsibility has received widespread
recognition last year melco received the 5 years plus caring company logo from the hong kong
council of social service as well as the best csr award from financeasia these awards in addition
to the awards we have received in previous years will spur us on to match or exceed our achievements
in the years ahead

for 2011 we will be making youth development a priority we wish to provide better educational
opportunities for disadvantaged children in the community and to promote their allround development
so that they can lead full and fulfilling lives as child poverty and the widening gap between rich and poor
have become serious issues in hong kong we believe it is vital that more resources be allocated to this
segment of society

these initiatives are all part of our ongoing efforts to identify and respond to the needs of the community
and our stakeholders i hope you enjoy reading this report and that it inspires you to contribute to a more
sustainable future for many generations to come i look forward to reporting our progress to you at this
time next year



                         we wish to provide better educational and
                         development opportunities for disadvantaged
                         children and youth to help them realize their full
                         potential and lead more fulfilling lives
