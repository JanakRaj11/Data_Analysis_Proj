 aspiring to superior growth

 as a result of our strategy ucb aims to exceed the                         as a result in 2013 ucb expects revenues to grow by a
 biopharma industrys compounded growth we also expect                      lowsingledigit percent excluding exchange rate impacts
 to invest more than our peers in rd proportionally to                      to approximately  34 billion recurring ebitda between
 our sales while gradually reaching peer profitability through                680 and  710 million and a core eps range of  190
 lower marketing and selling expenses as well as general                     and  205 based on 179 million of shares
 and administrative expenses than our peers

although energy consumption is very much linked to our

ucb in 2012 has reduced with 8  this reduction is partly
linked to the reduced level of activities at the site in monheim
germany where the consumption of water was almost                        0
