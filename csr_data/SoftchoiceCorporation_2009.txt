reducing our footprint
softchoices environmental management policy
we believe that actively promoting business sustainability is both a corporate and
individual responsibility

operating as a sustainable business includes
    being responsible for the safe disposal of the products we sell for this reason we are
     reusing old equipment by donating it to charity and safely recycling equipment that is
     unusable
    educating our customers on green technology options reducing the impact of business
     operations in terms of energy use waste an carbon emissions
    helping to bridge the digital divide

we will encourage our employees to take steps as individuals to protect the environment
as well as empower them to ensure that all corporate actions are in compliance with our
corporate sustainability policies



making greener decisions
green procurement and leasing
softchoice recognizes that our own operations and purchasing decisions have a direct
effect on the environment in 2008 we asked 50 of our largest suppliers to participate
in an environmental audit our goal was to assess which suppliers already had strong
environmental policies in place and to gain a better understanding of any new policies slated
for implementation in the near future through direct engagement and open communication
our goal is to work with our partners toward a shared vision of sustainable business practices

over the past two years we have also worked with variety of property management companies
to create more sustainable work environments in cases where a softchoice office lease does
not contain environmental sustainability clauses we have taken the initiative to retrofit these
office spaces for example in toronto and chicago we have converted our lighting fixtures to
lowenergy systems that include automatic shutoffs at the end of every business day we have
also introduced waste sorting and recycling programs in the majority of our offices and as of
2008 we only use nontoxic cleaners to maintain the cleanliness of our facilities




                                                                                                   3table of contents   softchoice 200708 csr   11

office recycling
through an internal audit that took place at the beginning of 2008 we determined that
only 43 percent of our facilities had recycling programs in place to accommodate common
waste such as paper glass and aluminum thanks to the leadership of our facilities
department and our local branch managers softchoice has now implemented recycling
programs at more than 90 percent of our locations we expect to roll out recycling
programs across our remaining offices by mid2009

to make it easier for our people and cleaning staff to reduce unnecessary waste softchoice
invested in new recycling bins made from 100 percent postconsumer recycled materials
these bins are clearly marked and strategically situated in common gathering areas such as
office kitchens to encourage use we are also pleased to note that softchoice now has small
electronics and battery recycling receptacles at our toronto headquarters and plans to roll
out similar programs across our branch offices in the coming months



eliminating disposables
the convenience of grabbing a plastic fork or spoon at lunchtime was what originally led
softchoice to purchase plastic cutlery for our toronto headquarters kitchens however upon
closer examination it was estimated that softchoice employees were using roughly 12000
pieces of plastic cutlery monthly at a cost of approximately 7000 per year as of jan 1
2008 softchoice stopped purchasing disposables and has instead stocked all kitchens with
reusable cutlery mugs glasses and plates through this one action we will help keep
144000 pieces of plastic out of public landfills every year




                                                                                              3table of contents   softchoice 200708 csr   12

printless program
measuring our footprint
softchoice has installed preo printelligence software to establish a baseline measure for
paper consumption across our organization to promote conservation the software places
a small icon on every employees pc or laptop allowing them to instantly see how much
they have been printing and what their rank is at softchoice in terms of total paper
consumption in addition all softchoice printers are set to print doublesided automatically
so that a user has to manually change the setting to print singlesided currently softchoice
prints approximately 93000 sheets of paper every month through a companywide
awareness campaign we have challenged all departments to reduce their paper use by 15
percent or 79000 sheets by 2009

electronic pay stubs
with roughly 900 employees issuing biweekly pay stubs generates a lot of paper waste
softchoice is proud to announce that all employees in the us now have the option
to receive their pay stubs electronically we plan to give this same option to canadian
employees before the end of 2009

electronic invoicing
softchoice now has the ability to provide electronic invoicing to customers who request it
plans are also under way to create a formal signup process to actively promote this option
to the 19000 organizations we support



green events
our fiscal launch in january and annual sales rally in july are companywide events that
date back to the very beginning of softchoice bringing people together twice yearly is an
important part of our culture and teambuilding initiatives however as with any major
event there is a significant environmental cost over the past year we have made strides
toward reducing the negative impact of these events on our planet for example wherever
possible we now order locally grown seasonal foods maintain a no paper handouts
rule and no longer distribute bottled water we also arrange for group transport via shuttle
buses to discourage people from traveling by singleoccupancy vehicles to and from
corporate events

lives and the cost of taking public transit in that area as part of the initiative softchoice
announced that it would no longer subsidize parking for new employees with the
exception of individuals who join softchoice in an outbound sales capacity at our seattle

fuel efficiency as well as for employees who regularly carpool to work

energy efficiency

lighting system retrofit
at the end of 2007 softchoice undertook a major project to retrofit the lighting systems in      we have also continued to improve the efficiency of our data center through virtualization
our toronto headquarters our internal green team made the business case and enlisted             and the adoption of blade server technology by consolidating the servers required to run our
more than 40 employee volunteers to replace nearly 600 light bulbs with new energy               business applications we are reducing the number of physical servers as well as the real
efficient compact fluorescents the project also included the installation of automated           estate it resources and energy required to support them this has resulted in a smaller carbon
timers to turn off lights during nonwork hours as well as sensors that adjust task lighting     footprint and lower overall operating costs as of the end of 2008 approximately 70 percent of
conditions based on available natural light through these efforts softchoice achieved a 70       our data center environment was operating in a virtualized capacity
percent reduction in power costs or approximately 40000 per year in savings moreover
by reducing energy consumption by 647000 kwh per year we have also reduced carbon
emission by 868000 pounds annually



pc power management
                                              in 2008 softchoice deployed a tool called
                                              faronics powersave to measure pc energy
                                              use across our organization our first audit
                                              indicated that on average 20 to 40 percent of
                                              pcs were being left on more or less 24 hours a
day as a result of this finding we have now automated the powering down of any system
that has been inactive for more than two hours to avoid disruptions to the business end
users receive advance warning through onscreen prompts in addition the data associated
with any open application are automatically saved through the rollout of powersave
softchoice has reduced its energy consumption by 130000 kwh per year or the equivalent
of 13000 in utility savings

our people make the difference

sustaining our focus on green
softchoices sustainenable strategy began as a grassroots effort by employees who
believed strongly in the cause of environmental sustainability as we look forward the
biggest potential lies with the ongoing leadership of our people accordingly we created
three important pillars of the strategy that will further grow and encourage the efforts of
employees across the organization
