spill prevention and management
preventing spills is essential to limiting our environmental impact ensuring a
safe workplace and reducing costs effective spill management requires routine
maintenance situational preparedness and continuous improvement in every
phase of our operations
our spill prevention principles focus our efforts on four areas transferring fluid
following operational procedures ensuring equipment integrity and considering
spill prevention in our site design we use these four focus areas to promote
tangible fieldbased practices that are incorporated into our operations and work
sites to prevent spills from occurring

waste management
effective waste management enables encana to minimize our impacts to the
environment our waste management practices ensure that waste generated by
our activities is appropriately classified for proper handling storage transportation
tracking and disposal in accordance with regulatory requirements

water management
our water requirements and the nature of our operations require tailored approaches
to water management we regularly assess and implement technologies and
processes to improve our water management practices we work in compliance with
robust regulatory regimes which encourage responsible water use
sourcing water for our operations is unique to each location as the availability and
quality of water can vary significantly depending on the nature of each resource play
and the location of each well there are various sources of water used in developing oil
and natural gas nonpotable water surface water shallow and deep ground water and
recycledreused water depending on the availability cost and regulatory requirements
in each area we may use one or more of these sources for our operations




                                                                                           4

induced seismicity
the overall occurrence of induced seismicity in
relation to oil and gas activity either by hydraulic
fracturing or wastewater disposal is generally very
low and limited to a few specific areas encana
has operating procedures to help manage the
occurrence and magnitude of induced seismicity
to levels that minimize any associated or perceived
risks these procedures have been developed based
on experience with seismicity associated with the
limited cases involving hydraulic fracturing as well as
operations related to well injection

wildlife and habitat management
minimizing our impact to wildlife and habitat is
not only regulated by law but is an important
consideration as we strive to conduct our business
responsibly we actively manage our development
schedules and operational footprint to account for
a wide range of wildlife and habitat concerns to
identify sitespecific wildlife and habitat issues and
minimize disturbance we conduct environmental
and wildlife assessments during the project planning
process and continuously monitor our performance
throughout our operations
