report 2016

                                              foreword 


                       dear reader

                       we are proud to present our second sustainability report to you as in our first report last
                       year we have sought to describe our sustainability policy and actions in an effective and
                       attractive way the goal of this report is to share our vision on sustainability and to show
                       how we are pursuing this in practice on account of our modest size as a company
                       we are not yet at the stage that we can report in accordance with global reporting
                       initiative standards besides we prefer to show what we find important and to convey
                       our dedication to the human side instead of discussing graphs and metrics this report
                       emphasises the main areas of concern our approach and our results obviously these
                       results are always a work in progress

                       this year we will continue where we left off last year working together in and with small
                       producer cooperatives always requires much effort but once it succeeds and people
                       start to see the benefits it becomes a source of joy and pride and intense satisfaction
                       the plastic collection project in peru is one of those projects even though it is not
                       easy to achieve especially as there is little official support for it let alone systems and
                       infrastructure


      working together in and with small producer cooperatives always requires much
     effort but once it succeeds and people start to see the benefits it becomes a source
                            of joy and pride and intense satisfaction

                       to involve our producers more in the objectives this year we are organising a contest in
                       which our producers can propose projects and ideas the best project or idea will win a
                       substantial financial award that can be used to realise the project

                       i am tempted to tell you so much more than fits on this page so i suggest instead that
                       you turn the page to find out for yourself

     in conjunction with the rapid growth of the world                                         extra efforts where reality asks for it under the title active
     population agriculture has been scaled up and intensified                               sustainability
     this has led to larger yields per hectare but also to depletion
     of natural resources and an increase of pests
     we recognize that we cannot close our eyes to the
     problems the world faces but also that we cannot make
     the difference by operating on our own and cooperation

     plastic recycling peru
     collecting waste and raising awareness


     in 2014 we launched our plastic recycling project in peru
     this year we have continued our efforts to create awareness
     and increase the volume of collected plastic waste while working
     towards a longterm sustainable and costcovering or even
     profitable recycling plan

     the producers awareness campaign has had several followups
     with teams of volunteers collecting plastic waste from road sides
     and villages

     producers are obliged to collect their farm plastic and deliver it
     to local rework facilities for the first processing steps towards
     recycling the plastic is then sent to lima where it is reworked
     into garden hoses plastic furniture etc

     as the local rework facilities are limited and quite rudimentary
     usually a covered outdoor area with simple equipment like a
     shredder agrofair has developed a feasible business plan to
     start a complete recycling plan in the piura region we are now
     discussing with coinvestors to turn this plan into a reality
     the problem of plastic waste however is not limited to banana
     plastic alone there is no collection system for household
     waste and therefore people are accustomed to dumping their
     waste by the side of the road through consultation with local
     governments our aim is to raise awareness and encourage them
     to take action

     with these efforts together with our producers we continue to
     take steps towards our final goal to have an environment free of
     plastic waste in the piura region




           through consultation with local                                bags of reworked plastic
                                                                          ready for transport to lima

     building new sustainability levels in our own organization


     co2 compensation
     last year we reported on schemes to reduce and compensate
     for co2 emissions caused by employee transport as of 2015
     we also added co2 compensation caused by lorry transport all
     emissions are compensated via the climate neutral groups gold
     standard cooking stove project these projects provide efficient
     charcoal ovens to local households in developing countries
     such as uganda to replace their traditional open wood fires in
     addition to reducing co2 emissions caused by burning wood
     the ovens also help prevent deforestation save the households
     time and money and protect against smokerelated health
     issues

     coowned by small farmers
     a unique feature of agrofair is that producer cooperatives from
     various countries participate in our company together they
     form the cooperative of agrofair producers cpaf which owns
     30 of the shares of agrofair every year the cpaf receives its
     share in the dividend of agrofair in this way the value added
     by the company in europe is ploughed back to the producers
     the cpaf has one board member on the supervisory board of
     agrofair

     the cpaf holds an annual meeting and provides services to
                                                                            gold standard

     agrofair played a pioneering role in making bananas            of antifouling paint and oillubricants the shipping lines
     more fair and sustainable its been twenty years since we     environmental policies and management systems are also
     introduced the oké banana but our work is far from done      evaluated that includes social policy
     the fairtrade system gives our banana farmers a fair price
     guaranteed sales and a premium for social development         sustainability is an important aspect of our procurement
     as a result our farmers who also coown the company are      policy in that process the ccwg enables us to make well
     doing much better now than they were twenty years ago         informed decisions that can be objectively evaluated by

     this is a good time to see whether we can make the entire      with our partners to make the shipping industry even more
     chain sustainable so not just production but transport as     sustainable
     well that is why we launched our active sustainability
     plan last year which focuses on creating a sustainable
     chain the shipping industry is an important part of that

     businesstobusiness initiative dedicated to improving
     the environmental achievements of seagoing container
     transport the clean cargo working group has developed
     tools to measure and report on the environmental effects of

     panama disease
     a global threat to bananas
     we contribute to worldclass research




     the soilborne fungal disease fusarium wilt tropical race       there is no resistant variety available developing one is a
     4 commonly known as the panama disease is currently         matter of a lot of patience and astronomic investment so
     the biggest threat to the banana industry we are not just      prevention is the only viable strategy at this point
     talking about the banana for export which represents a
     mere 15 of the volume panama disease presents also            for further news on tr4 spreading and for information on
     a threat to banana varieties including plantains or cooking   the wageningen university and research centre wurs
     bananas that are produced for local markets by small           research programmes on tr4 please visit
     producers in africa and asia                                   wwwpanamadiseaseorg

     over the course of four years agrofair contributed a total
     amount of 100000 to the panama disease research
     programme conducted by the wageningen university and
     research centre wur in the netherlands as one of the
     major contributors agrofair was invited to participate in
     a partner workshop in april 2016 in miami the objective
     of the meeting was to share the results of the ongoing
     research programme as well as to bring the partners
     together and gather input

     professor dr gert kema the leader of the programme
     stated that the main question is not if but when tr4 will
     reach latin america and the caribbean and whether
     banana companies producers and government institutions
     will be ready to deal with it based on devastating
     experiences with tr1 in the past and on how tr4 is
     presently being managed in asia it seems that history
     might repeat itself

     it has become clear that many producer organisations in
     latin america and the caribbean that produce and export
     bananas are not yet aware of the threat in the next year
     agrofair south will therefore concentrate on increasing a
     general awareness of tr4 simple biosecurity measures
     come clean go clean should be massively adopted to
     prevent the lethal fungus from infecting their banana farms

     the pesticide
     footprint of bananas
     how much harm does plant protection cause


     labels to indicate standards of sustainability have become
     very common in the banana world fairtrade organic
     rainforest alliance and iso 14003 all promise a higher
     ecological standard or even claim to be sustainable
     however as long as bananas are grown in monocultures
     in hot humid climates the fruits and plants have to be
     protected against a range of pests such as fungi and
     insects only in warm dry regions with enough irrigation
     that are close to a sea port can export bananas be grown
     organically without using chemical pesticides such
     regions are rare we wanted to know more than what the
     label on a banana claims so we turned to specialists who
     were able to develop a method for us to calculate the
     impact on human health and on ecosystems
                                                                         wwwmusaramaorgenimageaerialspraying144html
                                                                         auteur luc de lapeyre de bellaire
     the method is based on the usetox model for which there
     is broad scientific support the usetox model is a method
     for lifecycle analysisit simulates the fate of pesticides in the
     environment and their effects on plants and animals such
     as water organisms usetox calculates a relative number
     as an indication for the damage done to human health
     and ecosystems in this way usetox calculates the impact
     of pesticides on the wider environment this reveals how
     good a certain banana is for the rainforest rather than just
     putting a label on it even though the fruit you eat is free of
     chemical residues and constantly analysed by european
     food safety laboratories there is an impact on the local
     environment this is what the model wants to show

                                             the pesticide footprint of bananas 




     below we compare a sample of our fairtrade farms in
     ecuador with a fictional average conventional farm in costa
     rica it shows that our farms in ecuador are much friendlier
     to the environment and to human health than the average
     farm in the humid tropics the method can also be used
     to compare different fruits different countries and different
     application schemes

     nature preservation
     in panama
     we protect the neighbours of our banana farm 
     sea turtles wildlife and existing trees

     with the fair trade premium and a contribution from the
     swiss supermarket chain the coobana cooperative group
     in panama purchased 22 hectares of land adjoining one
     of its banana plantations the main aim of this acquisition
     is to improve the drainage of the plantation in case of
     heavy rainfall however only a very small percentage of
     land is needed for this purpose the rest of the area will be
     used for reforestation and nature preservation the land
     is situated near an existing protected area including part
     of the san san river part of the biosphere programme by
     unesco home to some rare species including manatees
     sea turtles lay their eggs on the banks of this river every
     year coobana also sponsors this project using the ft
     premium

     in the last year a plan was made to preserve and restore
     nature on the 22 hectares of newly acquired land the idea
     is to plant native trees and to develop ecotourism with a
     trail through the area and a traditional restaurant
     reforestation is a longterm project it will take years to
     really establish a forest however the first very important
     steps have been taken the acquisition of the land and the
     protection of existing trees and wildlife hopefully the river
     banks of this land will also be used by nesting sea turtles in
     the near future

     bananeros el guabo sets a great example for
     el guabo and the entire region                                         el guabo


     with the opening a logistic dream has come true for the el
     guabo farmers as fabiola ramon president of el guabo
     cooperative explained in her speech

     the start of the el guabo cooperative wasnt
     easy for the 14 small farmers who embarked on
     the adventure of direct export they were greeted
     by mocking and incredulous bystanders who
     saw it as a foolish move and just a pipedream
     when they loaded the first container in a little
     street in the centre of el guabo town but since
     that day almost 20 years ago we have expanded
     to include 135 farmers and today we ship 25
     containers a week for which we now have our
     own loading site here in el guabo

     the logistics centre for the farmers offers significant
     savings on their transport costs now everything can be
     done in the same place the logistics centre was built
     with a loading floor for container trailers this makes the
     cooperative very innovative in the region it is now easier
     for the farmers to arrive with their pallets and fewer people
     are needed to load and unload cargo the logistics chain
     has become more efficient and now includes all modern
     facilities the roads to and from the logistics centre and the
     office are now completely asphalted thanks to the fairtrade
     premium the farmers received previously heavy rainfall
     regularly made the roads muddy and slippery in the rainy
     season sometimes even unusable this positively affects
     the farmers productivity and the transport agrofair is very
     proud of these achievements
