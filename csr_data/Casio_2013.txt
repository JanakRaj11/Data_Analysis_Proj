    the core of casios csr is ensuring that all of our employees embrace our founding spirit and work every day
    to build a more sustainable global society


     committed to building a sustainable global society

    casio computer co ltd was founded in 1957 by my two older brothers tadao and
    toshio me and my younger brother yukio
    tadao the eldest passed away in 1993 followed by toshio in may 2012
    toshio one of the alltime great inventors laid the foundation for our corporate creed of
    creativity and contribution with his various breakthrough inventions
    with toshio in charge of development and me handling sales we sometimes clashed at
    meetings but i always had a strong bond with this dependable brother of mine


    although half of the original four kashio brothers are now gone our founding spirit
    remains the unwavering force behind casio
    this spirit is all about identifying unmet universal needs and developing entirely new
    products by going from 0 to 1 to contribute to society

    in recent years sustainability has become a global issue
    to name just a few challenges we face the destruction of nature and serious water and
    food shortages caused by extremely rapid population growth
    economic activities that enrich peoples lives have also created huge distortions in the
    global environment and our societies
    these include the depletion of natural resources global warming loss of biodiversity and extreme disparity between rich and poor
    if we continue our economic activities in pursuit of only the benefit at hand we could end up depriving succeeding generations of a
    sustainable future we must squarely face this critical situation and fulfill our responsibilities by taking the necessary steps to endow
    upcoming generations with a sustainable global society

    building on our heritage of going from 0 to 1 casio will continue to fulfill this mission




     csr issues for casio

    as a global enterprise whose products are sold in over 140 countries the casio group heeds common global principles we declared our
    support for the un global compact and our csr management is based on it using the iso 26000 international csr guidelines issued in
    november 2010 we have taken an inventory of the csr issues facing all our group companies in and outside japan based on this we
    selected respect for human rights as our priority theme for fiscal 2014 and all casio group companies are working to increase employee
    sensitivity to this issue in order to promote diversity and encourage the hiring and promotion of women seniors persons with disabilities
    and nonjapanese we are moving forward with human resource system reform and other initiatives
    i am confident that this will invigorate casio and drive further growth by fostering personal growth and success for individual employees
    as a good corporate citizen casio believes it is vital that our business activities themselves help to solve social issues and we are striving
    to provide support in unique ways that only casio can with products useful in the classroom such as calculators electronic dictionaries
    electronic musical instruments and digital cameras our social contribution priority is in the field of education
    in japan casio continues to support education for orphans and other children affected by the great east japan earthquake we also give
    talks at schools under our unique class on life initiative
    outside japan casio is contributing to the quality of education by helping to solve classroom issues through the provision of products that

meet the educational needs of each country

responsibilities while staying in dialogue with all types of stakeholders i look forward to hearing your frank opinions of our efforts




                                                                                                        casio sustainability report 2013

    casios unique class on life initiative started with the aspiration to eliminate bullying and suicide from
    childrens world
    a cumulative total of over 15000 children and their parents have already attended these classes at over 200
    schools


     class on life

    the power of children can change the world of adults
      i wanted to help end the vicious cycle some 28000 people kill themselves in japan
      each year and approximately 580 of them are youth under 20 children learn by
      observing adults in order to break this terrible cycle i thought it was important to start
      by addressing our childrens world this is how hisashi wakao of the csr promotion
      office secretarial and external affairs department explained the class on life
      initiative
      the class on life was started by casio computer co ltd as a social contribution
      activity in june 2007 to help build a more sustainable society so far the classes have
      reached over 15000 children and their parents providing them with an opportunity to
      question the purpose and consider the value of life wakao is passionate about the
      class after thoroughly pondering what i wanted to convey to children the answer i
      arrived at was life i certainly didnt want it to be a superficial effort so i knew i had to
      be really sincere with the kids thats when i decided to teach them about the value of              hisashi wakao csr promotion office
      life                                                                                             secretarial and external affairs department




    the key is talking with sincerity
      at first the topic was considered to be too serious for elementary and junior high school
      students when he first started visiting schools to give the class teachers often cautioned him
      that the students might not understand and said they would not like to give a class on this topic
      wakao recalls in my class i convey the value of life and its purpose the message is the
      same even when i teach a kindergarten class at one elementary school i gave the class to
      firstgrade students after the lesson one little boy came up to me and announced that he now
      understood the meaning of life to my surprise he said that the real purpose of life is to live life
      earnestly actually this topic is not something children dont understand they understand it
                                                                                                                   at a session in the class on life
      instinctively as a result of our selfcentered perspective we adults tend to underestimate
      children and limit their horizons if you talk to children sincerely they will definitely understand
      the message
      sincerity is a word that wakao uses often that is why there is no manual for my class i make a point of trying to convey my own
      humanity in the lesson each class is different and the lesson evolves each time i deliver it i learn something from the kids and then
      build on it for the next class if i didnt approach it this way i wouldnt be able to convey the message sincerely to the children

empowering children
  the positive reaction to the class on life has grown so much that it has virtually become a
  social phenomenon as a result of the initiative nagatadai elementary school in yokohama
  became the only elementary school to exhibit at ecoproducts japans largest environmental
  trade show at the event students from first to sixth grades eagerly presented their ideas to
  adults walking by wakao explains the learning does not finish at the end of the class the
  children that attend the class must go on to take action
  the influence on the children does not end here many of the kids that learn about the value of
  life in this class are changed dramatically in fact in letters that wakao receives from students
                                                                                                           student booth at ecoproducts
  after the class there are often comments such as i stopped having suicidal thoughts i have
  looked the other way when someone is bullied so far but now i want to be brave and try to stop
  it and ill stop bullying others wakao says there are many children who tell me personal stories that they could not share with
  their teachers nothing could be more rewarding for me than discouraging suicide and seeing these kids return to their energetic
  selves




movement spreading throughout japan
  the actions of these children are having a ripple effect across japan mobilizing adults as well
  news of the class has gone viral and requests for the class have been received from schools
  all across japan many adults including educators parents and local residents have also been
  impressed by the actions of the children that attended the class wakao says it has also
  increased opportunities for me to give presentations to adults when i talk about the significance
  of this class and what i want to achieve through it many people respond by saying that adults
  need to change too
  collaboration with teachers is also evolving wakao often gives presentations about his class to
                                                                                                          presentation to educators
  educators from around the world as a model example of education for sustainable development
  esd recommended by japans ministry of education culture sports science and
  technology in his presentation he talks about how children grow and change after attending the class many international
  participants have responded to his presentation with comments such as this kind of serious esd activity is new to me i was very
  impressed and want to introduce it in my country and i was very moved by the students message thanking her parents for giving
  birth to her




continuing with the class as a broader casio initiative
  what does the company think about wakaos initiative noriaki kimura manager of the csr promotion office said i think he has
  had such amazing results because his words come straight from his heart to the childrens hearts he doesnt just talk in a formal
  manner the issue we now face is replicating what he has done so that the class on life can grow further and the entire company
  can get behind it i would like him to train new instructors to do what he does so we can develop it into a more structured activity that
  shows what casio stands for
  wakao says he is very grateful the company understands his initiative and has supported it through this initiative i hope to show a
  lot of people that casio does have such passionate people using the class on life wakao wants to help ensure that as many
  children as possible develop healthy minds and kind hearts this is just one example of casios classroom initiatives and it is sure to
  keep growing in the future

     feedback on the class on life

    about the class on life
      the class on life conducted at our school is life education based on diverse knowledge and multiple perspectives going beyond
      the usual prepackaged classroom experience and lesson i feel that it is a revolutionary class from many different angles teaching
      students how to approach life learn and live mr wakao kindly incorporates the wishes of the teachers and the thoughts of the
      children into the content he conveys making his classes always fresh and new his efforts do not end when the class is over as he
      continually shares ideas with us that we can implement with his involvement throughout the year i feel the class has become a

      enthusiasm for integrated studies

      able to maintain their awareness of the importance of life throughout the year

      teacher
      the class on life is always a turning point for my students it is an opportunity for them to start learning it motivates them when they
      lose confidence in their learning abilities and it helps them discover new perspectives by listening to mr wakao someone who is not
      their usual teacher and receiving his support the children become more motivated to learn which improves their confidence

      in the class of life we heard about a 13 yearold girl who battled with cancer she tried to live her life positively and with courage
      even while fighting the disease this gave hope to herself and the people around her im shorttempered and sometimes get irritated
      easily after learning about that girl i want to try and improve myself i found out that there are many people in the world with physical
      disabilities in my case however i can run eat talk and feel things when i think about people with disabilities it feels strange to be
      irritated with my own life it is very unfortunate that the girl died but i pray she will find eternal peace in heaven

    as management globalizes respect for human rights has become a vital issue for companies casio is
    developing a unique approach to the issue and working proactively to create mechanisms to address it this
    feature highlights the advice of makoto teranaka of tokyo keizai university and outlines the steps casio is
    taking


     addressing human rights issues the right way

    getting the proper perspective on human rights
      everyone probably has a different idea of what specifically should be done to ensure respect for human rights human rights concerns
      arise in a wide range of contexts including conflict and child labor as well as discrimination in workplaces based on nationality place
      of birth religion gender sexual orientation and so forth many of you may think these issues are far removed from your own
      company nevertheless every company invariably has some kind of human rights problem that must be addressed there are many
      more examples than the ones i just mentioned and human rights awareness takes many forms depending on the laws and culture of
      each country as well as the differing views of individuals in other words it is very appropriate to say that human rights issues exist in
      every organization
      addressing human rights issues does not mean actually reducing them to zero the important thing is to try and see things from the
      perspective of those victims whose human rights are abused by considering why the people concerned are dissatisfied and what
      methods should be used to address the issue you will be able to see problems that you had not recognized before then you will
      realize that you can find more human rights issues that need to be addressed therefore it is important for companies to try to identify
      and address as many potential human rights issues as possible when addressing human right issues the process of uncovering the
      issues is the most challenging and important




    how should casio address human rights
      through my participation in casio events such as the stakeholder dialogue the human
      rights roundtable and a meeting of csr committee held in 2012 i have been able to hear
      frank views from many casio employees working on the frontlines the results of the
      questionnaire survey show that casio sites around the world are responding decisively
      based on their respective laws and cultures however employees still seem to have a very
      vague overall notion of why casio is addressing respect for human rights including a vague
      understanding of human rights itself
      i think that casio employees are implementing obligatory initiatives including compliance
      efforts with a very high level of awareness however if they try to tackle human right issues
      in the same manner they may get stuck on trying to reduce human rights issues to zero as
      i mentioned earlier the important thing is to consider specific ways to incorporate respect         makoto teranaka visiting professor
      for human rights into management based on an awareness of the importance of actually                     tokyo keizai university
      protecting human rights in other words you must create strong casio policies on human
      rights and implement them it is now clear to me that casio has more than enough ability to
      promote csr initiatives from a management perspective i hope you will continue to
      advance your csr efforts even further

 process for casios human rights initiatives

stakeholder dialogue june 22 2012
  makoto teranaka gave a talk on corporate activities and human rights he was then joined
  by kaori kuroda and they responded to questions and comments from the audience the
  dialogue event covered the following three themes 1 how to address human rights issues
  2 criteria for determining such issues and 3 human rights problems of employees
  including hiring of foreign workers


  see here for more datails on the stakeholder dialogue




human rights questionnaire february and march 2013
  a questionnaire on human rights and business practices was sent to 34 casio group companies in and outside japan it contained 15
  questions on human rights awareness labor management compliance religious considerations and employee hotlines the
  compiled survey results were shared with all the group companies




human rights roundtable may 14 2013
  using the survey results teranaka spoke with employees that deal particularly directly with
  human right issues in their jobs ie those in recruitment labor relations sales supply
  chain relations and those working at casio sites outside japan after sharing how human
  rights are viewed at the main sites of the casio group and what efforts are being carried
  out teranaka provided them with advice on future initiatives in the second half of the
  roundtable the participants also discussed the need for a shared human rights policy and
  the importance of having clear policies for the entire casio group




csr committee meeting may 28 2013
  the results of the human rights survey and roundtable were reported to the csr
  committee and teranaka was invited to attend he reported on specific comments made in
  the roundtable and offered his opinion on how casio should approach human rights issues
  in the future




 next steps

based on the analysis results and content of the discussions casio recognizes it is important to globally improve governance structures for
protecting human rights accordingly a casio human rights policy will be established in fiscal 2014 the group also aims to establish a
casio human rights investigation tool in order to clarify human rights infringement and the scope of responsibility




                                                                                                   casio sustainability report 2013

    making life richer and more convenient by creating innovative productsthis was the aspiration of casios
    founders and it is summed up in the corporate creed creativity and contribution casio believes that part of
    its social responsibility is to pass down this corporate creed to all of its employees without fail casio is
    determined to ensure that its businesses which make something from nothing or go from 0 to 1 continue
    to make a consistent contribution to a more sustainable global society


     welcoming the challenge of helping to build a more sustainable global society

    in recent years there has been widespread concern over the sustainability of human civilization in its current form while economic activity
    has enriched the lives of many people it has also put great strain on the global environment and social systems cooperation is needed to
    overcome this global crisis and leave a sustainable global society to future generations in order to achieve this proactive initiatives need to
    be taken by individuals companies governments and international organizations a company has a much larger impact on society than an
    individual and corporate activities are responsible for some of the current impact on the planet this is why society now has much greater
    expectations for companies to actively implement their own initiatives to help resolve sustainability issues or in other words to fulfill their
    corporate social responsibility csr today a companys performance on social responsibility impacts its corporate value firms that fail to
    fulfill their corporate social responsibilities are no longer valued or allowed to survive by society

    casios corporate creed of creativity and contribution contains the companys founding idea of social contribution through the provision of
    innovative products that have never existed before everyone working at casio fully appreciates this corporate creed and the company is
    always striving to help build a more sustainable global society by pursuing business activities designed to make something from nothing or
    go from 0 to 1 this is casios csr approach


    to ensure that it continues to deliver on the commitments of its corporate creed casio has established three key documents the charter
    of creativity for casio outlines the basic principles behind the mindset and conduct expected from everyone at casio while the casio
    common commitment provides specific conduct guidelines for implementing the charter the casio group code of conduct
    establishes norms for ethical conduct and requires all casio group executives and employees to comply with relevant laws and internal
    rules with recent changes in the external environment in june 2013 casio revised the code of conduct to reflect the higher expectations
    of the international community with a focus on the areas of human rights supply chain management and anticorruption measures


    casio has established four specific keywords shown below to guide its efforts to address social and environmental issues that relate
    directly and indirectly to its business operations by addressing these issues the company aims to help build a more sustainable global
    society


    the world today is faced with many complex economic environmental and social problems of a very serious nature humanity as a whole
    needs to consider its own best future and then find ways to move in that direction if economic activities are to be maintained on this planet
    with limited resources every member of society must try to help achieve sustainability

    casio is determined to do its part to find solutions for social and environmental issues while continuing to provide new value to society
    based on its corporate creed of creativity and contribution casio will steadily pursue specific initiatives while always seeking to conceive
    of ideal solutions for each issue

each law regarding laws where casio had deficiencies relating to management cycle operation and manual preparation the committee
analyzed the importance of each risk based on the occurrence possibility and its impact on company management measures were then
prepared to deal first with the risks of higher importance

     business continuity plan bcp initiatives

    in order to respond to emergencies with the resources of the company organization casio has created a crisis management manual for
    securing the safety of all employees executives and their families preserving corporate assets sequential updates of the manual keep
    pace with changes in the business environment and the company is taking practical initiatives at the same time specifically the following
    measures have already been undertaken
       implementation of regular evacuation drills and general lifesaving classes for employees
        distribution of emergency assistance kits to employees and additional disaster stockpiling
        disaster prevention drill with the local community and provision of an open area for a temporary evacuation site


    however with the great east japan earthquake which struck in march 2011 circumstances were encountered that far exceeded previous
    expectations casio was able to identify various points for improvement these points were reflected in a revised crisis management
    manual based on the premise of responding to a major earthquake with tokyo at its epicenter casio also produced the disaster handbook
    for the families of its employees to deepen understanding of disaster countermeasures in the home and promote disaster readiness


    together with the initiatives above casio is working to enhance its business continuity plan bcp in the event of an emergency that
    interrupts business operations such as a major earthquake with an epicenter in the tokyo area the plan outlines measures for the rapid
    confirmation of executive and employee whereabouts and wellbeing as well as damage conditions and the quick recovery and
    maintenance of operations this mechanism is focused on casios global supply chain for example if the headquarters suffers a disaster
    an emergency headquarters is set up at the appropriate key site based on a priority determined in advance under the direction of the
    headquarters the aim is to minimize damage by continuing to provide products and services to customers worldwide based on limited
    resources through rapid restoration of business operation the confidence of business partners and customers is maintained

       measures are more important than ever before in addition to an internal data center casio utilizes a secure external data center that
       features seismic construction and selfcontained power generation


       casio has also lowered its disaster risk by actively utilizing public cloud computing infrastructure for some of its business content and
       services in october 2011 casio also moved its email system an important means of communication for employees to a
       professional external provider
       the company also performs disaster drills in conjunction with the groupwide business continuity plan

casios approach to product development is all about creating something from nothing or going from 0 to
1
casio employs its creative product planning and design capabilities to conceive new ways to meet consumers
latent needs
casios advanced technologies are then put to work to deliver products that provide entirely new value


 casios ever  advancing core technologies

casio is constantly developing its five core technologies to make it possible to turn groundbreaking ideas into actual product

casios ever advancing core technologies




 product planning

going beyond conventional thinking the  0 to  1 approach to meeting the essence
of user need
casio focuses on the experience that people really want to have with its products this ensures
that the companys product planning is always fresh as developers even think outside the box of
casios existing technologies a good example of this was the development of a new digital
camera with a highspeed image processing engine that enables users to press the shutter button
at very short intervals the idea for this new camera came from a frustrating experience that casio
developer nobuyoshi nishizaka had one day
he missed the initial moments of his childs first solo bike ride because his highspeed continuous     nobuyoshi nishizaka
shooting camera was busy processing images taken an instant before and was not ready for the             qv product division
shutter to be pressed again he himself had been part of the team that developed the advanced
continuous shooting function but nishizaka realized the camera could not quite capture certain
truly unexpected nowornever photo opportunities up to that point the development approach
had been to create highspeed continuous shooting that could capture virtually anything clearly it
was time to expand the concept so he went back to the drawing board aiming to create a camera
that anyone can easily use to capture the truly spontaneous memorable moments of life this
flexibility to think beyond even successful existing ideasthe freedom to consider what is really
neededis the key to innovation at casio

                                                                                                         the unpredictable spontaneous
                                                                                                         fleeting smile of a child




                                                                                                       casio sustainability report 2013
                                                                     37

     technology

    creating new amazement with technology that makes the impossible possible
    casio makes the most of its original digital technology to take on the challenge of making the
    impossible possiblein more ways than one one example is the casio air sound source which
    digitally recreates the rich sound and tonal qualities of a grand piano the harder the player hits
    the keys the brighter and more powerful the sound while a soft touch enables gentle delicate
    expression not only that the transitions between levels of hard and soft playing are virtually
    seamless air sound source delivers sound with natural depth by adding threedimensional
    sound morphing from the time the note starts until it dies away this very closely mimics the
    unique sound of a grand piano where the wooden case and strings resonate together
                                                                                                              air sound source generates natural
    highspeed arithmetic processing enables the instanttoinstant simulation of the complex
                                                                                                              changes in tones as they fade away
    changes in tone that occur inside a grand piano this would be impossible using a conventional
    pcm sound system which uses only prerecorded samples for each note casio keeps pushing
    the frontiers of digital technology to do the impossibleand digital technology is just one of
    casios core technologies



     design

    providing plenty of style options something for everyone
    casio uses a design approach called cmf for color material and finish perfect for
    creating product variation this process makes it efficient for casio to offer a variety of
    different looks for each model designers can give a base model not only different colors but
    also a wide range of material textures and surface finishes with gshock watches for
    example special printing or metallic treatment on the plastic base material gives each design
    a unique feel which would be difficult with actual metal or natural leather for watches the
    cmf approach is reflected not only in the hands and dial but also in the watchband to
    provide each watch with its own strong personality customers love to express themselves by
    choosing the casio product that best fits who they want to be this is yet another way that
    casio creates new value




                                                                                                          recreating the texture of leather materials
                                                                                                          with a special surface treatment


     going beyond universal design to humancentered design

    casio works to develop products using humancentered design hcd in conformity with iso
    13407 processes with the objective of improving product ease of use as part of the products
    overall quality in the hcd process casio seeks optimal ease of use by determining important
    issues from customer feedback and observation of product use in realworld situations
    through repeated evaluation and verification casio works to develop highly desirable
    products
    the vt500 series of tablet terminals was developed to provide support in a variety of
    business environments they feature a userreplaceable highcapacity rechargeable battery
    for long hours of operation and a sam slot to support a higher level of security the tablets        business support tablet terminal vt500
    can also withstand drops from one meter are dust and splashproof ip54 compliant and can
    operate in temperatures ranging from 20c to 50c the vt500 series offers outstanding
    gripability for comfortable operation even in the rain or other environments where objects

 digital design data shared on a network

casio products are all designed in 3d using computer software and are stored as digital data these
files are centrally managed along with circuit diagrams component data specifications and
production schedules and are shared via network with production sites and logistics facilities this
system was established to enable casio to flexibly adapt to changing conditions such as changes in
user needs and the economic environment
by sharing this data throughout the company casio can ensure that circuits and parts that work the
same way even if used in different product areas are standardized achieving lower procurement
costs and greater efficiency in assembly if any problems arise in relation to quality or the
environment casio can efficiently go through its past product lineup to determine if there is a need to
replace a certain part or can work across departmental lines to examine the total environmental
impact for instance calculating the amount of designated chemical substances contained in
products
design data is also used in the creation of catalogs and instruction manuals since design data can
be used to create 3d diagrams and crosssection diagrams there is no need to start drawing new
diagrams from scratch this accelerates the production process and keeps costs down



 platform design for flexible production

casios electronic dictionaries come in a variety of models and in a wide array of colors to meet the needs of todays diverse users to
efficiently produce product lineups that span a wide range of configurations casio integrates all the common parts of each product to
create a single platform unit this allows casio to keep costs down by ordering parts in large quantities and to improve manufacturing
efficiency by standardizing production processes


casio determines how many of each product to ship by looking at the market conditions immediately before shipment inserting different
types of content into the platform units assembling the exterior and then packaging the products this allows casio to supply only the
number of models necessary in the shortest period of time

casios primary mission is to deliver the products desired by customers at the right time the company is
working to strengthen its global supply chain and to continue providing cuttingedge products without
interruption


 approach to stable product supply

delivering a stable supply of products to consumers is one of the most important responsibilities of a manufacturer and is required to
ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty

as part of casios mission to provide delight happiness and pleasure to customers through its innovative products the company is
promoting the following policies



      policies on stable product supply

         1 we strive to shorten production leadtime and improve planning and execution accuracy by using it to streamline the
            supply chain procurementproductionlogisticssalesservice
         2 we build good relationships with component suppliers to ensure stable procurement
         3 we maintain the flexibility needed to address various risks involved in manufacturing by
             building a production system with at least two production sites for each product
             producing multiple products at each casio group production site
             maintaining inhouse production and inlining of key devices and components




 supply network is highly responsive to changes in demand

since sales for products such as electronic dictionaries for education for schools teachers and students are concentrated in the early
spring when the japanese school year starts this makes accurate sales planning more difficult on the other hand the components at the
core of these products such as semiconductors and display devices have a procurement lead time that is determined by the market this
means longterm planning is required


accordingly casio has taken various measures to minimize the loss of sales opportunities and has worked to expand its market share

one such measure is the operation of parallel supply chain management systems scm at the headquarters procurement division and a
production site in order to enhance capacity simulation speed

production sites carry out simulations based on sales plans provided by the sales department and calculate the personnel and equipment
levels needed for production before making the necessary arrangements the materials procurement department adjusts the procurement
quantities every week by looking at information on materials to be received and the models prioritized by the sales department these
efforts help ensure timely production delivery


in the case of electronic dictionaries by using common platforms as base models and performing primary assembly production it is
possible to add individual model specifications such as dictionary content display panels and keyboards during secondary assembly just
prior to delivery this enables casio to rapidly meet changes in customer demand

in the past all parts procurement was carried out three months in advance however through the use of model platforms the lead time for
final product specifications determination has been shortened to just two weeks in advance which also helps minimize surplus production

casio responds to the competitive and rapidly changing market for digital cameras by using weekly supply chain management in all
divisions for sales procurement and production




                                                                                                    casio sustainability report 2013
                                                                     55

     diversifying production risk and producing core components inhouse

    casio maintains a stable supply of products by having each production site manufacture multiple product items and by ensuring that two
    different sites can produce any given casio product


    the company is also increasing the internal production of components in order to protect newly created technologies and to reduce parts
    procurement risk


    production sites for individual products




          highlight

          casios new plant in nakhonratchasima thailand is located on high ground making it
          less susceptible to floods casio has added the new plant to its existing major production
          sites with a view to enhancing business continuity planning bcp and diversifying risk
          through global manufacturing casio will continue to expand the plants production scale
          and functions


                                                                                                       casio thailand

    left an hour early for lunch to renew a drivers license
      previously one had to take a half day off in order to attend to a personal matter during the work day now one can take time off on an
      hourly basis which is a more efficient way to use holiday time
    took hours off to take her twoyearold daughter for vaccinations and to meet with daycare staff
      it is handy to take time off by the hour since i also want to save my holiday time in case my daughter gets sick
    wanted to leave a couple of hours early to catch a ball game
      a great way to break up my work routine i felt very energized when i returned to work the next day

      realizing a lowcarbon society
    the december 2012 general elections for the house of representatives in japan resulted in a change of government from the democratic
    party of japan dpj to the liberal democratic party ldp and japans basic energy plan is now being drafted as part of this the
    current government will start from scratch in its review completely reconsidering what the dpj administration had proposed that 15 of
    japans energy come from nuclear power once the basic energy plan is launched the next step will be drafting japans new targets for
    reduction of greenhouse gas emissions ahead of cop19 at the end of the year

    meanwhile as part of an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2013 keidanren japan business federation decided to
    launch its new commitment to a low carbon society  which goes a step beyond its voluntary action plan on the environment effective
    through 2012 and includes penalties for failure to achieve targets the target for the electrical and electronics industries is an annual
    reduction in perunit energy consumption of 1 yamagata casio co ltd casio electronic manufacturing co ltd and the hamura rd
    center of casio computer co ltd will participate in keidanrens plan it will be necessary to reduce perunit energy consumption by an
    annual average of 1 until 2020 and casio is actively pursuing initiatives moreover in terms of products that contribute to saving energy
    during use it has been decided to calculate the contribution from page printers as the applicable item for casio casio is taking steps
    towards the establishment and disclosure of calculation methods in line with trends the companies are also taking measures to establish a
    calculation method and provide disclosure in these areas while staying in step with carbon footprint best practices

  building a recycling society
thus far casio has recycled personal computers and rechargeable batteries based on japans act on the promotion of effective utilization
of resources and made voluntary efforts to collect page printer toner and drum sets and name land cartridges moreover the small
electronic appliance recycling program became law this fiscal year mandating that rare and precious metals be reclaimed manufacturers
are responsible for making products easier to disassemble and are expected to use recycled materials almost all of casios consumer
products will be subject to the program as small appliances in order to respond to the program casio conducted interviews previously with
a number of recycling companies to compile requirements relating to the recycling process for small appliances ranging from disassembly
to reutilization informed them about its efforts in the product development and design process and implemented improvement measures
fullscale collection by municipalities and stores will commence in fall 2013 and casio plans to analyze data from these sources and make
efforts to upgrade its programs in order to increase reutilization rates



   living in harmony with nature and preserving biodiversity
in march 2011 casio issued the casio group biodiversity guidelines as part of the guidelines casio has established a target for
implementing biodiversity impact assessments relating to its operations and the locations of its offices and plants based on this casio
commenced a pilot environmental impact study on paper last fiscal year paper uses wood as a raw material which is not problematic
when raw materials are sourced from wood from properly managed forest resources and recycled paper casio will contribute to
biodiversity by confirming that the instruction manuals for casio products and catalogues as well as the various paper products used in
offices pose no problems for the preservation of biodiversity casio will continue to expand the scope of its studies and action themes in the
future


  conclusion
the environmental trends that surround casio are broadreaching and it is important for casio to implement its own unique environmental
management strategy we will strive to contribute to the environment while also strengthening the casio brand by creating products that are
compact lightweight slim and energy efficient and which help to realize a paperless society moreover globalscale environmental
regulations are becoming increasingly stringent this is obviously true for products but it is also the case for regulations on recycling and

in order to ensure that the next generation inherits this irreplaceable planet casio has established and is
implementing climate change action with medium and longterm targets to be achieved by fiscal 2051


 approach to setting medium and longterm targets

with the establishment of these medium and longterm targets casio intends to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions significantly
moreover the company is emphasizing its goal of becoming carbon neutral1 which means reducing casios net greenhouse gas
emissions to zero accordingly casio has adopted the following environmental management policy


       casios goal is to become carbon neutral by leveraging its ability to develop compact lightweight slim and energy
       efficient products to create new markets and cultural phenomenon


1 casio defines carbon neutral as offsetting its direct co2 emissions with co2 emissions reduction and absorption through other methods


scope of emissions reduction targets
when casio established its medium and longterm emissions reduction targets it also announced the target scope as greenhouse gas
emission from business activities at casios production sites and offices in japan and around the world furthermore casio is aiming to
become a carbon neutral company by offsetting its total volume of greenhouse gas emissions including the co2 emissions resulting from
logistics product usage employee travel and consignment production with the reduction effects of casios ecoproducts such as data
projectors electronic dictionaries and other products that promote paperless lifestyles

in addition to the co2 emissions reduction achieved by the efforts of the casio group the target co2 emissions reduction also includes
reductions due to the availability of cleaner energy such as electricity and due to carbon reduction in the entire social infrastructure see
diagram

co2 emissions reduction targets




switching to totalvolume emission reduction targets
with the setting of global medium and longterm targets totalvolume emissions reduction targets for greenhouse gases have been
established in japan and around the world including reduction targets and emission trading systems casio has now finished the move to
totalvolume emissions reduction targets

casio had already set targets for the total volume of greenhouse gas reduction at its offices worldwide however with the establishment of
its recent medium and longterm targets casio has now set worldwide targets for reductions in the total volume of co2 emissions which
is a change from previous targets for reduction per unit of production

the base year for casios medium and longterm targets is fiscal 2006 decided based on changes in casios business structure as well
as the scope and accuracy of data acquisition




                                                                                                                   casio sustainability report 2013
                                                                              101

     medium and longterm targets


          casio groups medium and longterm targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction

             mediumterm target to reduce the total volume of global greenhouse gas emissions from business activities by 30
             compared to fiscal 2006 by fiscal 2021
             longterm target to reduce the total volume of global greenhouse gas emissions from business activities by 80
             compared to fiscal 2006 by fiscal 2051
           business activities this indicates activities of production sites and offices in japan and overseas and does not include co2 emissions from
          logistics product usage or employee travel




     managing risks and opportunities

    as a result of the march 2011 great east japan earthquake and the ensuing accident at the fukushima nuclear power station virtually all
    nuclear power stations across japan have suspended operations japan is faced with such risks as rising electricity tariffs and power
    shortages in summer and winter moreover the greenhouse gas emission coefficient for electricity has risen as a result of the decline in the
    utilization of nuclear power generation resulting in an increase in real co2 emissions this translates into greater risk of incurring
    emissions trading costs under the ordinance on environmental preservation to secure the health and safety of the tokyo metropolitan
    area environmental preservation ordinance also in 2011 there was major flooding in thailand which may be partially attributable to
    global warming and upstream deforestation consequently global risks have become apparent including threats to the value chain for
    production and parts

    in order to avoid these risks casio plans to expand the introduction of renewable energy and secure alternatives in the value chain

    on the other hand the greenhouse gas reduction effect at time of product usage offered by casio products which promote paperless
    lifestyles such as data projectors and electronic dictionaries has been identified as a significant opportunity to address climate change
    over the product life cycle casio will work to further expand its business in these products

    in order to minimize the various risks mentioned above and expand opportunities casio must contribute to the sustainability of the planet
    and its human societies casio recognizes that this is an extremely important issue for further strengthening its business foundation and
    will make even more strenuous efforts in the fight against climate change




     measures for achieving medium and longterm targets

    casio has set medium and longterm targets for achievement by 2020 and 2050 among the three areas that the casio environmental
    declaration 2020 focuses on casio will put the highest priority on realizing a lowcarbon society

    realizing a lowcarbon society
    the casio group will provide products and services that make an even greater contribution to the reduction and absorption of co2
    emissions in addition to expanding products and services that use energy sources that are friendly to people and the planet including
    solar wind and hydro power casio will incorporate these renewable energy sources into its own business operations

    casio europe has been operating geothermal cooling and heating in its office building since january 2009 in fiscal 2013 casio will also
    begin investigating initiatives for the use of renewable energy including solar

    regarding other indirect co2 emissions ghg protocol scope 3 emissions casio will work to expand the scope of disclosure of other
    indirect co2 emissions generated during distribution and product usage which it already discloses based on the calculation guidelines
    being considered currently by the electrical and electronics industry associations

 measures for 2020

casio is studying the potential of the following initiatives to achieve the mediumterm target for 2020 it will also strive to assess as quickly
as possible their potential to help meet the 2050 target

  1 response to social environment changes after the great east japan earthquake
     responding to energy issues
     introducing renewable energy sources

  2 environmental contribution through product usage
     reducing the amount of electricity used by products
     minimizing and optimizing the amount of product packaging
      increasing the percentage of products that run on solar cells

  3 utilizing carbon offsets
     co2 absorption effect based on the expansion of paperless products reducing demand for logging etc
     purchasing carbon offsets for products
     promoting tree planting and greening
     emissions trading clean development mechanism cdm and joint implementation ji
  4 reduction of co2 emissions in various business activity processes
     materials procurement product manufacturing transport and distribution product usage recycling and disposal
      expansion of the scope of co2 emission data gathering on logistics transport efficiency improvement and modal shift
      making production facilities more energy efficient and improving production processes

  5 increasing the percentage of non fossilfuels used at sites
     installation of led lighting
     installation of solar panels
     installation of highly efficient air conditioning equipment




 new energy conservation targets for fiscal 2014 power fuel etc

starting in fiscal 2014 casio established the new energy conservation targets described below with a target year of fiscal 2016 in an
update of its energy conservation targets up to fiscal 2013

by fiscal 2016 the casio group overall will reduce energy usage crude oil equivalent kl by 13 per unit of total floor space compared
with fiscal 2011 in setting the new target casio changed from establishing targets for production sites in japan offices in japan
production sites outside japan and offices outside japan respectively as it did in the past to establishing an overall group target
moreover while the target for production sites was previously expressed per production casio has employed per unit of total floor space
for the new target which is as close as possible to an absolute target


casio has established energy conservation targets as a crude oil equivalency kl for fuel and power usage and this has made it possible
to evaluate actual energy conservation programs without relying on the co2 emission coefficient for purchased power




 fiscal 2013 performance

the amount of co2 emissions for the casio group overall in fiscal 2013 rose 57 compared to fiscal 2012 which represented a 645
decrease compared to fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2013 casio micronics was transferred kofu casio was closed down and energysaving
activities were carried out by the entire casio group as a result total energy use by the entire casio group fell by 79 in crude oil
equivalency compared to fiscal 2012 however the co2 emission coefficient for the amount of power in japan worsened by 36 compared
to the previous fiscal year so the total amount of co2 emissions increased

    this page introduces casios initiatives for preserving biodiversity


     casios approach to biodiversity preservation

    the 10th conference of parties to the convention on biological diversity cop10 was held in nagoya japan in october 2010 at this
    important international conference for resolving issues related to preserving the abundance of life on this planet the following measures
    were adopted
     new strategic biodiversity plan 2020 and the aichi biodiversity targets 2050
     nagoya protocol on access and benefitsharing
    in march 2011 casio established biodiversity guidelines for the entire casio group taking the first step on this issue in its environmental
    action plan casio is now carrying out activities based on this

    in fy2012 casio began investigating a checklist for environmental impact evaluation with the goal of assessing biodiversity impact the
    company also carried out elearning for about 700 employees in relevant departments concerning basic biodiversity preservation
    knowledge and casio measures in order to create a foundation for future impact assessment

    in fiscal 2013 casio prepared a biodiversity impact survey sheet covering paper relating to products and sites in cooperation with external
    npos and ngos active in environmental protection and commenced a pilot study of suppliers
    specifically regarding instruction manuals pamphlets and other materials in the area of products and paper for copiers drafting and other
    uses in the area of sites casio conducted a study into the usage of waste paper and paper from certified forests evaluated by thirdparty
    organizations and not products from manufacturers about which there are concerns over the legality of logging and environmental
    destruction and other areas
    casio will continue the program from fiscal 2014 aiming for the new environmental action plan described below which it established in
    fiscal 2013

    biodiversity preservation target
    based on the casio group biodiversity guidelines commence a biodiversity impact study for products and sites and examine and
    implement measures to reduce biodiversity impact by fiscal 2016 which will include procurement

    for products
    consider details concerning design procurement manufacture packaging sales logistics and recycling of products

    for sites
    consider details concerning location and operation of plants and offices

    fy2014 conduct a pilot study based on the impact survey sheet prepared in cooperation with nposngos examine strategy and
            direction for programs in light of the pilot study and its analysis and response to the action plan and guidelines for the electrical
            and electronics industries
    fy2015 based on results in fy2014 make improvements to the impact study sheet and the structure of the study and expand the scope
            of the impact study taking priority level into consideration examine measures for biodiversity in procurement
    fy2016 analyze the results up to fy2015 identify issues and establish and implement action themes to reduce biodiversity impact

casios green star products offer even greater environmental performance than casios conventional
products


 green star product concept

in order to minimize the environmental impact of its products casio is promoting the development of environmentally friendly products in
every aspect of planning and design


in 1993 casio began product assessment in order to systematize and promote its development of eco products new products had to
undergo a preliminary assessment for their environmental impact and meet certain criteria in order to be certified as casio green products
prior to fy2008 casio worked towards an initial green product sales target of 80 of total sales and in that year the company achieved
84 now the company promotes to continue target of 80


with the achievement of this target casio decided to create even stricter criteria and implement more specific detailed assessments
qualifying products are certified as green star products representing the best of casio green products this ensures that casios
products continue to set the bar higher and drive the realization of a sustainable society


for green star certified products the environmental features are listed in catalogues and on the product packages

    this page provides an overall picture of the environmental impact of the casio groups business activities


     what is a material balance

    a material balance shows the amount of resources used and the amount of materials with environmental impact that are produced
    outputs in business activities from rd to aftersales collection and recycling inputs


     fiscal 2013 performance

    in fiscal 2013 business activity inputs and outputs at production sites in japan fell primarily as a result of the transfer of casio micronics
    co ltd a group company since the great east japan earthquake which took place in march 2011 offices and production sites in japan
    have continued yearround energy saving activities which include summer and winter

    however although the amount of energy inputs declined compared to fiscal 2012 co2 emissions volumes for outputs conversely
    increased due to a substantial deterioration in the co2 emissions coefficient for the amount of domestic power casio will continue making
    efforts to improve production facilities and business processes as well as increasing the energy and resource efficiency of the products its
    sells to promote a reduction of its environmental impact


                         material balance in business activities fy2013




    1 ozone depleting substances have been fully phased out
    2 parts and materials include consumables such as toner cartridges
    3 recycled waste includes thermally recycled material
    4 product distribution is consigned to transportation companies

in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations casios main sites have acquired iso14001 certification and operate an
environmental management system under the environmental management system casio plans and executes environmental protection
activities based on a range of environmental legislation and the casio group environmental action plan as well as various voluntary action
plans established by keidanren and the industry association moreover casio applies and operates its own unique environmental
management system to relatively small office sites which takes into account the extent of their environmental impact




 co2
reducing co2 emissions


production sites in japan
the target for production sites in japan was a 35 reduction in co2 emissions per unit of actual production compared to fiscal 1991 in the
average for fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2013 simple average of evaluation results for each year due to the transfer of production subsidiaries in
the device business including kochi casio and casio micronics energy conservation activities including power saving the target was
achieved with a 527 reduction in co2 emissions compared to fiscal 1991 the figure for co2 emissions volume in fiscal 1991 the base
year uses the co2 emissions volume for businesses at the time as is without any special adjustments of the base year going forward
casio will strive to achieve the new target to be established for the entire group starting in fiscal 2014


office sites in japan
the target for office sites in japan was a 9 reduction in the total amount of co2 emissions compared to fiscal 1991 in the average for
fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2013 the performance was a 305 reduction compared to fiscal 1991 achieving the target casios independent
efforts which included the construction of energyefficient buildings at the hatsudai headquarters and hachioji rd center made a major
contribution to achieving the target the decline in sales compared to fiscal 2008 when the target was established also had an impact
going forward casio will strive to achieve the new target to be established for the entire group starting in fiscal 2014

production sites outside japan
the target for production sites outside japan was a 30 reduction in co2 emissions per unit of production in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal
2005 in fiscal 2013 emissions were 98 lower than in fiscal 2005 so the 30 reduction target was not achieved production sites outside
japan underwent frequent relocation of sites and reorganizations and closures making it difficult to address reductions consistently going
forward casio will strive to achieve the new target to be established for the entire group starting in fiscal 2014

office sites outside japan
the target for office sites outside of japan was a 3 reduction in the total amount of co2 emissions in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2005
in fiscal 2013 emissions were 412 higher than in fiscal 2005 since fiscal 2005 the number and size of office sites have increased in
conjunction with the growth in the overseas market resulting in a significant increase in total floor space although casio has also
constructed some new energy efficient buildings the increase in the amount of emissions has outpaced the reductions achieved by these
buildings going forward casio will strive to achieve the new target to be established for the entire group starting in fiscal 2014


logistics in japan
the target for co2 emissions from logistics activities in japan was a 22 reduction per unit of domestic sales in fiscal 2013 compared to
fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2013 emissions were 510 lower than in fiscal 2006 achieving the target in august 2011 the logistics center was
relocated from suzuka city mie prefecture to toda city saitama prefecture in january 2012 the eastern distribution center in kotoku
tokyo was amalgamated with the logistics center through this staged effort casio reduced the number of consumer distribution centers in
japan from five to four this transition not only shortened transportation distances but also facilitated a modal shift from truck to rail
helping to further reduce co2 emissions in fiscal 2013 casio began an initiative to send products manufactured overseas directly to the
western distribution center in osaka this allows transport distances to be shortened significantly by cutting out transit through the toda
logistics center


logistics outside japan
no specific co2 emissions reduction target has been set for logistics activities outside japan cargo shipped from china to north america
used to be sent to a sales company warehouse in chicago before being forwarded to client logistics centers since 2009 however the
cargo has been shipped from china direct to the various central logistics centers of clients which is helping to reduce co2 emissions
going forward casio will continue striving to improve energy efficiency and production processes at all of its production sites in and outside
japan moreover casio will promote energy efficiency including for lighting and heating and cooling equipment as it works to reduce the
amount of co2 emissions at its office sites in and outside japan


                                                                                                        casio sustainability report 2013

      greenhouse gases other than co2
    reduction of greenhouse gases other than co2


    the target for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions other than co2 is at least a 90 reduction compared to fiscal 2001 by fiscal 2013
    usage of sf6 was reduced substantially due to the sale of the device business in which sf6 was used in the past casio has also been
    promoting a switch to alternative hfcfree spray products for the remaining hfcs contained in dust blower sprays used in product
    repairs already achieving the target in fiscal 2012
    consequently starting in fiscal 2014 casio will transition to maintenance management which includes confirmation of amount of usage for
    each specific period without setting a new target

reducing waste
sites in japan
the target for reducing waste from sites in japan was a 50 reduction in waste per unit of actual production in fiscal 2013 compared to
fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2013 waste was 463 lower than in fiscal 2001 which fell slightly short of the 50 target
starting in fiscal 2014 casio will transition to management of total volume which will not be affected by production volume


production sites outside japan
the target for reducing waste from sites outside japan was a 30 reduction in waste per unit of production compared to fiscal 2005 in
fiscal 2013 waste was 480 lower than in fiscal 2005 meeting the target

     water resources
    reducing input of water resources
    production sites in japan
    the target for production sites in japan was a 25 reduction in water resource input per unit of actual production in fiscal 2013 compared
    to fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2013 water input per unit of actual production was 930 lower than in fiscal 2001 meeting the target the reasons
    for this significant reduction were as with the reduction in co2 emissions at production sites in japan the sale of production subsidiaries in
    the device business and liquidation of companies
    starting in fiscal 2014 casio will establish a new target for total usage

    production sites outside japan
    the target for production sites outside of japan was a 15 reduction in water resource input per unit of production in fiscal 2013 compared
    to fiscal 2005
    the result was an 87 reduction compared to fiscal 2005 which did not meet the 15 target
    starting in fiscal 2014 casio will establish a new target for total usage and strive to make reductions through such means as reviewing
    production processes

 paper resources
reducing usage of paper resources
the reduction target for the usage of office paper at sites in japan was a 10 reduction compared to fiscal 2008 by fiscal 2013 per unit of
sales
the result for fiscal 2013 was 518 higher than in fiscal 2008 failing to meet the target the reasons for the increase were that reductions
in paper usage have plateaued and sales were sluggish starting in fiscal 2014 casio will establish a new target for total usage which will
not be affected by sales

 prtr
reducing prtr substances
the target for reduction of usage and releases of substances specified by japans prtr act was a 40 reduction per unit of actual
production compared to fiscal 2004 by fiscal 2013
the result for fiscal 2013 was 100 lower than fiscal 2004 meeting the target
the reason for achievement of the target was that the main sources of emissions no longer existed due to the liquidation of production
subsidiaries that used to release prtr substances consequently starting in fiscal 2014 casio will transition to maintenance management
which includes confirmation of amount of usage for each specific period without setting a new target

    reducing nox sox dust
    casios atmospheric emissions of nitrogen oxides nox sulfur oxides sox and dust in the peak year of fy2006 were 138 tons 37 tons
    and 2 tons respectively emissions in fy2013 were dramatically lower at 03 tons 04 tons and 00 tons respectively the reason for
    these significant reductions was the transfer of a company out of the casio group and its removal from the scope of computation along
    with a decrease in production activities following a business closure by adjusting settings and practicing indoor temperature management
    casio also intends to continue reducing emissions of atmospheric pollution generated by air conditioning equipment such as hot and chilled
    water generators

      2 outputs
           1 co2emissions
               the co2 conversion factors for electricity used to calculate output amounts are as follows
                 for emissions in japan casio used an emission coefficient of 000035 tco2kwh as announced by the federation of
                 electric power companies to reflect an adjustment for depreciation credit this coefficient was also adopted by the japan
                 business federation in its voluntary action plan
                 for emissions outside japan the emissions factor adjusted for the co2 emissions from chp combined heat and power
                 generated electricity was used it is taken from the latest year value 2003 estimate in the japan electrical manufacturers
                 association jema estimate survey june 2006
           2 other greenhouse gas emissions
                 these were calculated in accordance with japans act on promotion of global warming countermeasures
           3 waste
                 recycling amount is calculated as the amount of material consigned to consignees for intermediate processing plus the
                 amount of material consigned to consignees for thermal recycling
                 results related to waste for sales sites calculated by applying independent estimates with reference to manifest tickets etc
           4 base year values
                 the base year values are established by aggregating results for all business sites in existence at the time of the base year
                 without making revisions for sales of businesses and so on
           5 method for calculating average values for amount of co2 emissions
              for production sites in japan the average value for amount of co2 emissions is calculated as a simple average per unit of
              actual production for each of the five years between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2013 for office sites in japan the average amount
              of co2 emissions is calculated as a simple average of the amount of emissions for each of the five years between fiscal 2009
              and fiscal 2013

     carbon offset initiative

    as an initiative to help combat climate change casio began selling toner cartridges featuring a carbon offset in july 2008 in general
    carbon offset works like this an organization purchases a credit equivalent to a reduction of emissions of certain gases thought to
    contribute to climate change in order to cancel out its own emissions even though casios products are compact and energyefficient
    which in itself reduces emissions casios toner initiative seeks to offset co2 emissions equivalent to the amount generated to produce the
    electric power the printer uses during the life of the toner cartridge
    in the initial fiscal year casio performed the offsets using carbon credits from clean development mechanism cdm projects outside
    japan registered with the un cdm executive board in fiscal 2010 casio also began using japan verified emission reduction jver a
    newly created carbon credit system in japan in 2012 the final year of the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol the 9520
    tonsco2 that casio offset with carbon credits from cdm projects outside japan counted toward japans contribution helping with the
    achievement of japans 6 reduction target

    this section describes casios environmental protection initiatives in the area of general packaging

    casios special committee on packaging spearheads the companys effort to revise and improve general packaging
    specifically the committee promotes efforts to improve transport efficiency reduce co2 emissions during transportation and reduce the
    amount of material used in packaging by making packages more compact and lightweight for all products


    here are three examples of these activities

     1 watch packaging eliminated an extra step of distribution processing by standardizing packaging that had been different for each
     customer and further reduced the packaging size
     2 electronic dictionary packaging realized more compact packaging with fewer package components by improving the shock resistance
     of the products themselves
     3 digital camera packaging in consideration of actual customer usage eliminated some included items accessories and revised
     specifications of others thereby reducing packaging weight




     watch packaging

    casio redesigned three different packaging formats c ring stands that had been used for north american customers by standardizing the
    packaging format the packaging volume was reduced by about 17 in addition a step of distribution processing was eliminated

casio is working to ensure its logistical operations have as low an environmental impact as possible by
improving its intersite partsshipment routes and switching to more efficient modes of product transportation


 logistics process initiatives

casio is actively reducing its environmental impact by striving to reduce co2 and waste emissions arising from logistics

in order to reduce co2 emissions in the logistics process casio is promoting the following three action plans

  shortening transport distances promoting direct shipping to customers from logistics centers in and outside japan
  promoting a modal shift actively using modes of transport with low environmental impact such as rail for transport between sites
  improving loading efficiency and reducing transport volume improving the packaging design of digital cameras electronic
  dictionaries musical instruments electronic cash registers and other products and reducing the volume of packaging



relocation and consolidation of logistics centers in japan
casios logistics center in mie prefecture was moved to saitama prefecture and then its distribution center in tokyo was ultimately
consolidated with the logistics center a transition that was achieved in stages
in august 2011 the logistics center was moved from suzuka city mie prefecture to toda city saitama prefecture then in january 2012
the companys eastern distribution center in kotoku tokyo was consolidated with the logistics center
with this change casio reduced the number of consumer product distribution sites in japan from five to four this transition not only
shortened transport distances but also promoted a significant shift from truck to rail shipment and has contributed greatly to co2
emissions reduction

promoting modal shift and reducing intermediate transport




                                                                                                    casio sustainability report 2013
                                                                    133

      results of the transfer and consolidation

        1 elimination of intermediate transport
            shortened the distance from the logistics center to the hokkaido distribution center in sapporo
            intermediate transport no longer required from the logistics center to the eastern distribution center in tokyo
        2 promotion of modal shift
           partial shift to rail between the logistics center and the western distribution center in osaka
           switch to rail between the logistics center and the kyushu distribution center in fukuoka
        3 transport distance shortened
            shortened the transport distance in the kanto tokyo region which accounts for about 46 of direct shipments from the logistics
            center delivery direct to customers without going through a distribution center
       based on the results described above casio reduced co2 emissions by approximately 340 tons in fiscal 2013


      in fiscal 2013 casio began an initiative to send products manufactured outside japan directly to the western distribution center in
      osaka
      this allows transport distances to be shortened significantly by cutting out transit through the toda logistics center


    promoting direct delivery to north america
    casio is promoting direct delivery from logistics centers to corporate customers

    in the past products shipped from china to north america were sent to a warehouse of casio america inc in chicago before being
    delivered to the logistics centers of corporate customers in 2009 however casio began shipping directly to the central logistics centers of
    customers thereby helping to reduce co2 emissions in fiscal 2011 about 1800 tons of co2 emitted by the casio group and its
    customers were eliminated in this way

    in fiscal 2012 casio will promote further direct delivery efforts investigating direct shipment not just to the central logistics centers of
    customers but also to their regional centers


    promoting direct delivery to north america

introduction of reusable shipping cartons in asian distribution
to reduce packaging material casio is working to introduce the use of reusable
shipping cartons in its asian distribution operations

in an effort to switch to plastic reusable shipping cartons in its air freight shipments
between japan hong kong and thailand casio launched the use of new cartons in
september 2009

these cartons can be used to ship parts made in japan to hong kong for use at
chinese production sites and to ship timepiece parts from vendors in china from                   a reusable shipping carton employed for distribution in asia
hong kong to thailand by then transporting finished timepieces or timepiece parts
from thailand to japan the cartons never have to travel empty between the three countries

unlike traditional cardboard boxes these cartons do not have to be discarded and instead can be used many times over thereby reducing
environmental impact

casio has now begun to introduce even larger shipping cartons the large shipping cartons are mainly used for ocean transport packaging
damage can be avoided through the use of lcl shipping freight from different companies in one ocean shipping container which also
eliminates the need to use air transport when the shipping volume is small
starting in fiscal 2012 the reusable large shipping cartons are also being used to transport products




shipping carton receives chairman of japan external trade organization jetro award
on october 4 2012 the large shipping carton shown here received the chairman of japan external trade organization jetro award at
the japan packaging contest 2012 one of japans biggest packaging competitions which is organized by japan packaging institute


four products obtain eco rail mark certification
on february 28 2013 casio obtained eco rail mark certification from the railway freight association for four products clocks digital
pianos electronic keyboards and electronic cash registers

the eco rail mark indicates that a product or company is proactively addressing global environmental issues by using rail freight transport
rail transport produces about one sixth of the co2 emissions of commercial trucking making it an environmentally friendly method of
transport with a low environmental impact

the criteria for certification are utilization of rail for at least 30 of land freight transport for distances of 500km or more for a product and
utilization of rail for at least 15 of land freight transport for distances of 500km or more for a company

casio obtained eco rail mark certification as a company in october 2009 and successfully obtained product certification as a result of
further expanding rail transport due to the relocation amalgamation and closure of business sites

casio now actively uses rail for transport from its logistics center in saitama prefecture to distribution centers in hokkaido osaka and
fukuoka going forward casio will make active efforts to reduce environmental impact by pursuing environmentally friendly transport

    in compliance with global laws and standards casio is striving to achieve environmentally compliant product
    design and green procurement

     environmental laws and regulations relating to casio products and green procurement

    as a company with operations around the world casio must comply with the laws and standards of many different countries

    this is why casio starts with the design and procurement stages to ensure that its products comply with restrictions on specified chemical
    substances in parts and materials while complying with obligations for labeling information provision and energysaving standards for
    finished products

    in the procurement stage casio regularly updates its green procurement standards to ensure compatibility with all the current laws and
    standards in countries around the world thus by procuring parts and materials that meet its own strict standards casio can be confident
    that its product development meets legal requirements worldwide casio also ensures the compliance of its products by scientifically
    verifying and analyzing the content of chemical substances in parts and materials used

    in the design stage the company confirms that all parts and materials that will go into a completed casio product meet the casio green
    procurement standards products are approved for production only after confirmation using a database of the chemical substances
    contained in procured materials

    casio selects recyclable materials and provides symbol marks and the necessary information to ensure separate collection complying with
    the relevant laws and standards worldwide on product recovery and recycling as well as on chemical substances contained in products

    the company has also established internal standards to comply with laws for energysaving design such as europes energyrelated
    products erp requirements

as an initiative to help prevent climate change in the procurement stage casio requests suppliers not to use greenhouse gases in the
manufacturing process and also to ascertain and reduce their emissions of co2 in the development and design stages casio promotes
product development by setting targets that surpass its competitors products with the best energy consumption efficiency in the same
category

    casio is committed to green purchasing or the proactive effort to purchase environmentally friendly indirect materials which includes office
    supplies and office equipment excluding software casio pursued its goal of a 70 green purchasing rate2 in fiscal 2010 at sites that
    have adopted the cats ep system1 a goal established in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2010 the target was achieved with a rate of 70 in fiscal
    2011 casio worked toward a green purchasing target rate of 75 by fiscal 2013 however due to the major changes in economic
    conditions since 2009 performance has slipped since fiscal 2010 based on this analysis of results and the steps taken to further increase
    the share of green products purchased casio achieved an improvement in the green purchasing rate to 743 in fiscal 2013 almost equal
    to the 75 target for fiscal 2013 in the future casio will actively increase the share of green products purchased in order to keep its green
    purchasing rate at a minimum of 70

this section describes casios environmental protection initiatives in the area of general production


 saving resources by eliminating defects

at yamagata casio which boasts the most advanced manufacturing technologies of any casio
facility a computersimulated system is adopted for the design process in an effort to eliminate
the creation of defective products even before the trial production stage

they calculate the flow of resin inside a mold and try to predict and resolve any problems that
might occur in the manufacturing process this enables production to begin without a test
production phase thereby minimizing the waste of resources




                                                                                                      simulation display




                                          in the mass production stage the condition of the molds used to form components is analyzed
                                          digitally using acoustic emission ae technologies that yamagata casio developed itself this
                                          technology detects even slight deformations or cracks that appear in the mold over the course of
                                          manufacturing many tens of thousands of parts sounding an alarm before such problems can
                                          have an impact on product quality this prevents the generation of defective products

                                          as an indication of the success of these initiatives the factory is now using parts per million
mold diagnostic system using ae           ppm rather than a percentage  as the index to manage its defective product production rate

    all casio office sites are engaged in efforts to reduce co2 emissions and cut resource use by upgrading office
    equipment and improving work processes


     reducing power consumption through server integration

    casio has vastly reduced its energy consumption by integrating the servers that had once been disparately located across the group


    server integration results
    902 servers had been integrated by march 2013


    effects of reducing power consumption through server integration
    this server integration effort is resulted in a total reduction in power consumption of 1350000 kwh yielding a reduction in co2 emissions
    of 491 tons

     casio europes energyefficient building

    casios office sites have shifted from focusing on reducing co2 per unit of production to cutting
    the total volume of co2 emitted across the entire casio group in january 2009 casio europe
    integrated its offices distribution center and service center which had previously been separately
    located around germany into a new energyefficient building




                                                                                                                       casio europe


                                  this building has an innovative air conditioning system that uses geothermal exchange equipment 130m below
                                  ground to pump water through pipes embedded in the concrete ceiling and floor of the building the system
                                  pumps cool water in the summer and hot water in the winter to either cool or heat the building
                                  energy consumption in the building is further reduced by controlling room temperatures using blinds that open
                                  and close automatically according to the weather as well as proper ventilation

powersaving measures thus instead of just relying on its hardware the center has been enthusiastically pursuing other improvements
such as finely tuned temperature control adjustments and the revision of operation methods based on actual daily data

as a result of these efforts in fiscal 2010 five years after the base year of fiscal 2005 the center was able to reduce co2 emissions by
275 subsequently the organization and the number of employees at the center underwent significant changes in fiscal 2011 and fiscal
2012 because some of its departments carried out business combinations with other companies and substantial changes in singular values
were also observed in the amount of co2 emissions however in fiscal 2013 co2 emissions were less than half of what they were in the
base year of fiscal 2005

 the hachioji rd center  environmentally friendly since the design stage

                                                               the airconditioning system at the hachioji rd center features a large vertical

distance and the storage tank has become an energy
saving symbol for the entire hachioji rd center it holds
roughly the same volume of cooled water as a 25meter
elementary school pool and uses it for air conditioning


 natural ventilation system maximizes use of outside weather conditions

no heating equipment is needed at the hachioji rd center this is because the building has comprehensive protection against cold
weather which prevents interior heat from escaping and improves thermal efficiency
since room temperatures increase even in winter due to body heat and heat from equipment such as computers the interior is cooled by
letting outside air in as needed through ducts on each floor this provides ventilation through natural airflow using the chimney effect to
lower room temperatures thus the temperature is adjusted using hardly any electric power




                                                                                                              casio sustainability report 2013

    making the most of sunlight with automatic blinds

      the opening and closing of the blinds is controlled automatically by calculating the
    position of the sun and using sensors to detect its intensity at the same time thanks
    to this technology a comfortable interior environment is maintained
    in addition to this the system reduces unnecessary usage of electricity by regulating
    air conditioning to match the number of people in the center obtained by using building
    entry data and automatically control interior lighting switching it on and off and
    adjusting brightness with sensors that detect room brightness and human movement
    the building also has a green wall of vegetation to prevent it from heating up the
    center has developed educational tours for local elementary school students and
    others to explain the use of its features

                                                                                               automatic blinds

    in fiscal 2013 casio was not subject to any legal violations penalties fines or lawsuits relating to the environment




casio sustainability report 2013
                                                                           144

worldwide environmental regulations are being strengthened to preserve the beauty of the earth whether
global or local compliance with environmental regulations has become an integral part of the corporate
mission companies today recognize the need to address issues such as risk management and environmental
information disclosure while complying with greenhouse gas emissions regulations the prohibition of
products containing harmful chemical substances and iso 14001 legal requirements here is an overview of
casios environmental compliance initiatives


 standards management and audits regular internal audits and thirdparty audits

there are 14 casio sites which have obtained iso 14001 certification


each of these sites regularly implements conditions management and improvement activities by measuring concentrations of dust sox
and nox in exhaust emissions based on voluntary standards and standards established by national and local governments they also
measure wastewater quality water containing harmful substances moreover the sites measure and report usage conditions for harmful
atmospheric pollutants as well as handling quantities and atmospheric emissions of volatile organic compounds vocs


each site trains internal environmental auditors and environmental provisional auditors in addition to carrying out internal audits thirdparty
audits by external organizations are also regularly performed and improvement activities are carried out

going forward casio will work to improve the environmental risk detection skills of its internal environmental auditors as a way to improve
its overall environmental audit capability casio will also seek to improve auditors understanding of various environmental laws and
provide training in worldwide laws relating to chemical substance control and information management casio intends these auditors to lead
the way in environment compliance starting at the local site by discovering issues and proposing ways to improve



 compliance audits in the phases of product development design and manufacturing

in recent years laws and regulations on the environmental performance of products have become stricter in addition to stricter regulations
in eu nations and us states stronger laws are also being discussed and enacted in the newly emerging economies of asia and latin
america referencing those already established by developed countries in some cases the newer laws are based on the established ones
but they often have small differences in the specific requirements it is vital for casio to interpret these regulations properly and make
whatever product adjustments are needed


accordingly casio always obtains the latest news from each region and specialized information services while also exchanging information
with other companies in the same industry the information is used to check that casio products meet legal requirements the company
analyzes the text of laws including those under deliberation and establishes specific product response policies immediately after new laws
are officially announced ensuring that all casio products are legally compliant

casio has established a product environment law study working group within its new green product development council the working
group includes representatives from the environmental management technology developmentdesign and sales departments and
investigates measures for product compliance the group members share information establish reasonable response policies and confirm
response progress for efforts relating to both current and future laws they also offer support to the development design manufacturing
and sales departments

the working group performs the following

  1 gathering and sharing legal information from and with sources such as industrial associations sales companies in each region
     information services and other companies in the same industry
  2 analyzing and interpreting legal information
  3 ensuring obligations are met by manufacturing import export and sales entities
  4 creating development and design standards and conducting inspections
  5 improving the usage efficiency for design support tools database of chemical substances contained in products etc




                                                                                                       casio sustainability report 2013

    with the enactment of some regulations carrying severe penalties casio also recognizes the need to keep strengthening risk management


    furthermore casio conducts environmental audits before shipping new products in the development and design departments to check for
    environmental design that conforms not only to laws and regulations by also to the casio voluntary plan for the environment the group
    also conducts audits of chemical substances to check whether products comply with laws and regulations on chemical substances in
    various overseas markets products are cleared for shipment on confirmation that all parts and materials satisfy standards on chemical
    substances



     compliance relating to chemical substances contained in products

    countries around the world have implemented new laws pertaining to chemical substances contained in electrical and electronics products
    while existing laws continue to be strengthened each year individual laws and regulations vary in terms of the applicable chemical
    substances regulated applications exempt applications threshold values scope and requirements content restrictions labeling and
    information provision etc
    casio has consolidated the requirements of various laws on chemical substances contained in products and has incorporated them into the
    casio green procurement standards the development and design departments are then able to comply with regulations worldwide by
    checking a database to see whether a part or material to be included in a product meets the casio green procurement standards



     compliance relating to the proper collection recycling and disposal of used products

    countries around the world also have regulations for the collection and recycling of used electrical and electronics products packaging
    materials and batteries companies must comply with the requirements of each law including product design to save resources and
    facilitate recycling labeling and information provision to promote user participation in the sorted collection of products for recycling as well
    as information provision for proper product disposal
    through audits at the end of the product design process casio evaluates each product design in terms of resource savings ease of
    dismantling recycling potential and recycled material content confirmation is also made to see whether the recycling symbols and
    displayed information meet legal requirements worldwide
    casio established a project involving professionals such as engineers designers and others related to each product genre aimed at
    developing products that are easy to reuse in accordance with japans small electronic appliance recycling act which was enacted in
    april 2013 under the project casio conducted interviews on areas such as methods of disassembly with intermediate processors and
    metal refiners who handle recycling of used small appliances the company reflected the results of the interviews in its inhouse design
    manual to facilitate the development of products that are easy to reuse



     compliance relating to power consumption

    there are also regulations on power consumption and efficiency for electrical and electronics products including external power supplies
    and chargers based on product categories and power source types companies must also meet various requirements relating to power
    consumption and efficiency including regulations that require the meeting of minimum standards and those that mandate the display of
    power consumption information casio confirms the applicable regulations for each of its products and carries out product development
    and design to meet the requirements approval applications and reports are made to the relevant agencies as necessary



     compliance relating to energy saving and the prevention of global warming

    the following measures to comply with regulations on energy saving and the prevention of global warming are important efforts to achieve
    casios medium and longterm environmental vision and environmental declaration for the realization of a lowcarbon society

    1 act on the rational use of energy
    casio computer co ltd and certain group companies in japan are working on the rationalization of energy use as applicable business
    entities under the act on the rational use of energy in addition to the regular submission of reports and medium and longterm plans since
    fiscal 2010 these casio entities have set up management systems according to the determination standards relating to the rational use of
    energy

2 act on the promotion of global warming countermeasures
casio computer co ltd and applicable group companies do not exceed the standards for emissions of greenhouse gases other than
co2 arising from energy use set by japans act on the promotion of global warming countermeasures they are complying with
requirements for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by regularly submitting reports under the act on the rational use of energy

3 environmental regulations in tokyo
since fiscal 2009 the tokyo capandtrade program for greenhouse gas emissions has been in effect for large business facilities with
energy usage of more than 1500 kl per year crude oil equivalent located in tokyo the system requires companies to reduce total
greenhouse gas emissions against standard emission amounts in each upcoming fiveyear reduction period


a system for reporting on measures against global warming was also introduced in fiscal 2010 for all small and mediumsize business
facilities with energy usage of less than 1500 kl per year crude oil equivalent in tokyo


the applicable casio group sites understand the purpose of the program and are ascertaining current conditions implementing measures
and preparingsubmitting mandatory and voluntary reports based on the iso 14001 management system




 compliance relating to environmental information disclosure

there is a growing international movement calling for the creation of information disclosure standards for companies

along with the need for japanese standards to coincide with the international financial reporting standards ifrs there is a movement
calling for the provision of management commentaries mc as a form of disclosure of nonfinancial and corporate forecast information in
other words companies will need to disclose nonfinancial data which describes the connections between the companys current situation
business strategy risks and financial performance and other relevant information

in order to provide its stakeholders with the proper environmental information in a way that it is easy to understand casio has the following
aims

  1 to adopt more accurate indices relating to environmental impact and to provide comparable information
  2 to provide nonfinancial information including environmental information that indicates the connections with corporate strategy
  3 to explain the capability of environmental information to improve corporate performance

along with working to disclose environmental information casio will promote international disclosure standards for nonfinancial
information and work towards standardization

     initiative to save otoguro cherry trees

    otoguro cherry trees scientific name cerasus serrulata or komatsunagi are a type of wild
    cherry that comes into full bloom in mid april they have white blossoms measuring 5 to 6 cm and
    the leaves emerge at the same time as the blooms
    in the late 19th century and early 20th century this cherry tree variety was growing along the banks
    of the fuefuki river which flows through presentday chuo city in yamanashi prefecture the
    otoguro cherry gets its name from the otoguro embankment in the otoguro district where the
    trees used to bloom this variety of cherry tree has long been a favorite of the people in that
    region

    however with the improvement of the fuefuki river in 1932 the otoguro cherry trees were cut
    down mr matsuhiko tanaka of otoguro district grew grafted seedlings from a few remaining
    descendent trees in order to bring back the historic otoguro cherry his activities eventually came
    to fruition and a volunteer group for saving the otoguro cherry was established in 2002 the
    tamahocho now chuo city board of education lifelong learning center led the whole community
    in efforts to save and cultivate otoguro cherry trees this was achieved through cutting and grafting          otoguro cherry trees on the grounds
    methods using a few remaining descendents of the original trees

    as part of kofu casios environmental activities the company offered to participate in the cultivating of this endangered type of cherry tree
    for the purpose of preserving the variety and beautifying the landscape around the plant kofu casio received a donation of trees from
    tamahocho now chuo city in 2004 and over the three subsequent years the company planted more than 30 otoguro cherry trees all
    the transplanted trees took root and every spring they provide a beautiful display of blossoms for people to enjoy on the grounds of the
    kofu plant

    the otoguro cherry serves as a symbol of the connection between casio and the people of chuo city the company is proud of its early
    participation in helping to preserve the tree variety as part of its biodiversity protection efforts on the local level this is just one example of
    casios vision of harmony among people businesses and living things
    in fiscal 2013 the kofu office of casio business service co ltd took over kofu casios effort

    the opinion presented here was written based on the content of this report website version and interviews with
    casio personnel responsible for environmental procurement human resources and csr initiatives casio is
    now at a stage where the plandocheckact pdca management cycle with a focus on reducing the companys
    environmental impact should be used to expand csr initiatives groupwide


     commendable efforts by casio

     with respect to its medium to longterm environmental management policy casio has set greenhouse gas targets for fiscal 2021 and
     2051 and has expanded the reduction of environmental impact to include packaging and distribution this is in line with its commitment to
     realizing a lowcarbon society building a recycling society and living in harmony with nature and preserving biodiversity it is
     especially commendable that casio started surveys to verify that the paper used in its user manuals pamphlets and other publications is
     made from recycled paper certified timber and legally logged timber in addition to efforts within the group and supply chain i have
     strong expectations that casio will develop initiatives that cover the entire product lifecycle including the customer stagesuch as
     providing instructions on optimal product usage and improving the recycling rate at the time of disposaland also disclose information on
     the progress of those initiatives
     as an initiative to improve supplier csr casio conducted a questionnaire using a fivepoint scale on issues such as reducing
     environmental impact and protecting the human rights of employees and responses were received from 159 suppliers in china by
     providing feedback on the results making audit visits to some suppliers and providing case studies at meetings casio continued to seek
     to ascertain and quantify the situation of csr at its suppliers in the future i recommend that casio ask suppliers to provide data and
     other verifiable proof in their selfassessment of initiatives and work towards making the specific measures and issues even more readily
     visible i also hope that casio will further advance its system for sharing effective measures giving awards to outstanding suppliers and
     fostering communication to solve problems



     points for improvement while commending progress to date

     with respect to the csr implementation system it is admirable that casio conducted a survey of 32 group companies in and outside
     japan in order to advance initiatives focused on human rights and fair operating practices two of the iso 26000 core subjects however
     i continue to have strong expectations that casio will the same as with its environmental management policy verify issues and put
     measures into practice based on the establishment of mediumterm targets and indicators taking into account the future global economy
     and the trends at competitors
     regarding the fostering of a csr culture throughout the group it is commendable that casio maintains a csr series in its inhouse
     magazine casio in the future i hope that team leaders who have responsibility for implementing csr globally will be appointed to each
     site and department again i strongly urge casio to convey messages from senior management translated into multiple languages to
     casio sites around the world and to increase opportunities for ensuring that employees on the frontlines at headquarters and at sites
     around the world get a rapid and detailed understanding of the companys initiatives
     regarding efforts to create more supportive workplaces for employees it is commendable that 472 of employees at casio computer
     co ltd made use of the companys leave and reduced working hours programs for childcare and nursing care with an expected
     increase in employees that continue to work while caring for a family member at home or face other challenges outside of work the
     company needs to provide more opportunities for its employees to hear from users of these care support programs and ask questions
     about any topic
     in the area of employing persons with disabilities it is commendable that casios average consolidated performance in japan is once
     again above the legally mandated rate of employment i strongly urge the company to promote community creation efforts based on
     disability and job types and to continue making workplaces more supportive

points for improvement

concerning the utilization and improvement of human resources diversity throughout the group looking at the entire group in the near
future there should be a portfolio of global human resources that can move across divisional and company boundaries a system needs
to be developed for overseeing and promoting employee hiring training and exchange human resources databases should also be
improved and expanded for a comprehensive picture of staff in each country using efforts such as these i strongly recommend that
casio move forward with the creation of systems and strategies for the active utilization of human resources diversity as a truly global
company
regarding the environmental impact reduction data in this report it is commendable that details are provided on the principal sites in and
outside japan including group companies my hope however would be that casio will continue to increase the level of accuracy of group
reporting not only for environmental data but also for personnel and procurement initiatives and data
