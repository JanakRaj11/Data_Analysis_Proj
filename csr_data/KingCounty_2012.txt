          toward a sustainable prosperous king county
          2011 annual report of king countys
          climate change energy green building and environmental purchasing programs



      background
      the programs described in this report  climate change energy green building and
      environmental purchasing  help to meet core objectives of the king county strategic
      plan to reduce climate pollution prepare for the impacts of climate change reduce
      the environmental footprint of government operations and improve the financial
      sustainability of county government

      king county provides environmentally sustainable services such as transit farm and
      forest land protection salmon recovery flood control recycling parks and regional
      trails as highlighted in this report the countys role extends to climate change
      response energy efficiency and renewable energy green building and sustainable
      development and environmental purchasing

      this report prepared in accordance with king county code 1850010 provides a
      single point of reference for the public and decision makers about progress towards
      related environmental goals challenges and opportunities with these programs and
      priorities looking forward


      2011 key accomplishments
      the following are examples of major 2011 accomplishments in king countys
      climate change energy green building and environmental purchasing programs
      information about other 2011 project and program highlights that support the countys
      environmental sustainability goals can be found throughout this report

        king county metro provided transit service to more than 100 million passengers
         who traveled more than 543 million miles transit reduces communitywide
         greenhouse gas ghg emissions by replacing private vehicle trips reducing traffic
         congestion and supporting efficient land use

        king county parks and the water and land resources division continued to
         acquire protect restore and provide stewardship for natural lands that now include
         more than 26000 acres forests on these lands reduce the severity of local climate
         change impacts and naturally sequester carbon dioxide

        the facilities management division completed energy efficiency improvements
         that have resulted in a 19 percent reduction from 2007 levels


      2        toward a sustainable prosperous king county                  2011 annual report

 metro transit saved nearly 80000 gallons of fuel by replacing older diesel buses with
  more energy efficient hybrid buses

 king county agencies worked on 10 leadership in energy and environmental design
  leed projects 202 projects using the sustainable infrastructure scorecard and
  diverted from the landfill an average of 80 percent of construction and demolition
  material generated by these projects

 green building tools and training were provided to project managers including the
  green operations and maintenance manual and training in life cycle cost assessment

 king county purchased more than 60 million of environmentally preferable
  products with cost and durability savings of more than 15 million compared to
  conventional products

 county governments electronic waste is now recycled only through estewardcertified
  vendors ensuring sustainable practices for more than 68000 pounds of electronic
  equipment almost 7000 pounds of cathode ray tube monitors and 6300 pounds
  of batteries

 king county became the first local government in the nation to account for ghg
  emissions associated with the local consumption of goods and services such as food
  and electronics



2011 performance snapshot
it is important to look at the countys 2011 accomplishments in the context of broader
performance information this includes data about greenhouse gas emissions energy
usage and renewable energy at both the community level and from government operations
additional performance information about green building and environmental purchasing is
included in these chapters of the report

government operations
 normalized facility energy use related to king county government operations was
  reduced by 52 percent between 2007 and 2011 and king county is on track to meeting
  its 10 percent normalized energy use reduction target by 2012

 2011 normalized energy use by county vehicles ranged from 06 percent below to 62
  percent above 2007 levels depending on the type of normalization method used the
  2010 king county energy plan target is to achieve a 10 percent normalized net reduction
  in energy use by county vehicles by 2015 the increased energy usage by county
  vehicles is largely attributed to increasing transit service which has a net positive impact
  on community level energy usage

                                                   related ghg emissions from nontransit sources such as buildings decreased by roughly
                                                   4 percent however energy related emissions from overall government operations
                                                   including transit increased 1 percent between 2007 and 2011 significant additional
                                                   action will be required to achieve the 2015 target

challenges and opportunities
king county has adopted and is striving to meet aggressive targets for ghg emissions
reductions energy efficiency and renewable energy green building and environmental
purchasing achieving these goals will require upfront investments which can be
challenging given the reality of tight budgets at the same time king county is working to
meet the needs of a growing population and has important priorities to maintain or expand
services such as public transit which can sometimes increase the countys operational
environmental footprint

despite these challenges king county is committed to minimizing its environmental impacts
and supporting smart land use transportation green building and related efforts in the
region in terms of government operations the county is taking important steps to share
resources across agencies to support internal efforts  for example by sharing training
technical expertise and developing countywide approaches to implementing energy
efficiency projects and reinvesting energy and resource cost savings at the community
scale county actions can help continue and accelerate the recent trend of decreasing per
person sources of ghg emissions

in addition to the challenge of achieving the countys goals the scale of related
environmental changes facing the region is daunting climate change impacts such as
increasing river flooding decreasing summer river flows and rising sea levels have the
potential to cause severe and costly impacts to public and private property ecosystems and
public health

these new impacts are challenging to plan and prepare for but promising new
partnerships  for example through the king countycities climate collaboration  are
indications that the region is stepping up other new partnerships for example through king
countys community solar program are the type of partnerships that will need to occur for
the region to meet its environmental goals

additional exciting opportunities are emerging in 2011 king county became the first
local government in the nation to account for ghg emissions associated with the
local consumption of goods and services such as food and electronics this more
comprehensive picture of our environmental footprint quantifies  and helps king county
and its partners  target future climate solutions for example in 2012 the solid waste
division is implementing a reducing wasted food pilot project that could potentially serve
as a model for broader foodrelated efforts

a key nearterm challenge within the countys energy program is to ensure that two
significant new renewable energy projects become fully operational in 2012 the cedar hills
regional landfill renewable energy project and the west point wastewater treatment plant
electricity cogeneration project




toward a sustainable prosperous king county                   2011 annual report              5

advances in green building and sustainable infrastructure are tied to integrating sustainability
considerations into early phases of project planning and design so that projects can
be developed to have a lower overall impact even with future population growth green
building practices can help curb emissions through renewable energy energy and water
efficiency sustainable material use diverting demolition material innovative and adaptable
design promotion of alternative transportation passive ventilation daylighting and efficient
building envelopes there is a good opportunity to further integrate early planning objectives
in the near term as the green building and sustainable development ordinance will be
revised and updated in 2013

it has become increasingly clear to environmental purchasing experts that it can be difficult
to assess the true environmental preferability of the diverse range of products the county
purchases however opportunities are expanding to help develop environmental standards
and certifications that not only inform the countys purchases but also resident and
business choices


looking forward
 king county will implement the 2012 climate motion which outlined nearterm actions
  to reduce ghg emissions and complete development of a strategic climate action
  agenda to developed using the organizing framework of the king county strategic plan

 king county will continue to partner with cities through the king countycities climate
  collaboration and work with these and other regional partners through the growth
  management planning council to support development and adoption of regional ghg
  emissions reduction targets

 the county will establish new mechanisms for assessing lifecycle energy and resource
  costs financing the capital costs of efficiency investments documenting savings and
  supporting reinvestment efforts

 county divisions will prioritize adopting a green operations and maintenance manual
  to implement operation practices that will save money and reduce the countys
  environmental footprint

 the county will follow recommendations from the 2012 ghg emissions study on king
  county emissions as they relate to county purchasing of goods and services and
  implement targeted approaches to further reductions in ghg in purchasing

 the county will update its environmental purchasing policy to align with overall
  environmental sustainability goals and other policies

  climate change program



background
human sources of climate pollution such as carbon dioxide and methane are causing
unprecedented and severe changes in global and local climate systems this is the
collective opinion of the worlds leading scientists including the national academies and the
intergovernmental panel on climate change

in king county decreasing mountain snowpack increasing flooding and rising sea levels
are all evidence that the climate system is changing and is causing significant impacts in the
region the county faces significant environmental and economic challenges stemming from
climate change these challenges include stressed and rapidly changing ecosystems costly
impacts on public and private property and new public health risks

king county executive dow constantine and the county council are leaders in responding
to these challenges environmental sustainability is a key goal of king county as identified
in the 2010 strategic plan a key objective of this goal is to reduce climate pollution
and prepare for the impacts of climate change on the environment human health and
the economy

in support of this commitment the county took action in 2011 and early 2012 to strengthen
its efforts to respond to climate change efforts include unanimous adoption of the 2012
climate motion which outlines the countys nearterm commitments to help it meet long
term climate goals strengthening climate changerelated policies as part of the 2012
comprehensive plan update and beginning work on a new strategic climate action plan
that will focus and guide climate changerelated priorities


performance indicators
several performance indicators are tracking government and regional efforts to respond
to climate change key indicators include king county community wide sources of ghg
emissions see the executive summary as well as the indicators presented in this section
focused on government sources of ghgs core ghgs from buildings vehicles and solid
waste and local impacts of climate change

king county government operations direct greenhouse gas emissions
the 2012 executive transmitted comprehensive plan includes a nearterm goal that king
county reduce total ghg emissions from government operations compared to a 2007
baseline by at least 15 percent by 2015 preliminary data for 2011 indicates that overall
energy related ghg emissions from government operations are up roughly 1 percent since
2007 however emissions from nontransit sources such as buildings have decreased by 4
percent since 2007 this reduction is a sign of progress and related to implementation of the
2010 energy plan

2011 key accomplishments
reducing ghg emissions in county government operations
king county is reducing operational sources of ghg emissions by implementing its 2010
energy plan the green building and sustainable development policy and the environmental
purchasing program see the following chapters of this report for 2011 accomplishments in
these focus areas

reducing ghg emissions in the king county community as a whole
in addition to reducing its own operational environmental footprint king county is taking
important action to support resident business and local government efforts to reduce
climate pollution and prepare for the impacts of climate change

transit
  in 2011 king county metro provided transit service to more than 100 million
   passengers who traveled more than 543 million miles transit reduces communitywide
   ghg emissions by replacing private vehicle trips reducing traffic congestion and
   supporting efficient land use

 after its first year of operation the new bus rapid transit
  rapidride a line between federal way and tukwila delivered
  more than 30 percent additional daily bus rides than the regular
  metro route it replaced while ridership on the rapidride b line
  between bellevue and redmond increased 10 percent in its first
  three months

 king county partners with employers throughout the county
  to support their employee commute trip reduction programs
                                                                         new rapidride bus
  between 2007 and 2011 commute trip reduction worksites
  in king county experienced a 71 percent reduction in drive
  alone rate that resulted in 22 million fewer solo vehicle
  trips annually

   included redeveloping two miles of the burkegilman trail
   through lake forest park completing 12 miles of the east lake
   sammamish trail segment through redmond and upgrading
   a segment of the foothills trail near enumclaw based on
   bicycle and pedestrian counts at peak hours it is estimated that
   more than 20 million trips are made annually on regional trails
                                                                         newly redeveloped burkegilman trail
   including an estimated five million trips along five key corridors

                      public health  seattle  king county supported seven king county cities in adopting
                       policies to improve biking and walking for more than 359000 residents through efforts
                       such as comprehensive bicycle and pedestrian plans and complete streets ordinances
                       public health also partnered with school districts to implement safe routes to school
                       programs serving 124000 king county students and bicycle and pedestrian trainings
                       now completed for fourth and fifthgrade students in five king county school districts

                 recycling and waste reduction
                   the solid waste divisions waste prevention and recycling program uses education
                    incentives pilot programs and partnerships to reduce the generation of waste and
                    to increase recycling in 2010 about 832000 tons of recyclable and compostable
                    materials were collected in king county which is up 2 percent since 2009 recycling
                    helps reduce ghgs created by mining farming or manufacturing new products using
                    an environmental protection agency model recycling in king county is estimated
                    to reduced ghg emissions by an estimated 162 million metric tons annually 
                    the equivalent of removing 280000 passenger cars from the road

                                        an innovative example of improving recycling is the linkup program
                                         which is working to expand markets for recyclable and reusable
                                         materials and eliminate market barriers such as a lack of recycling
                                         infrastructure and poor endmarkets in 2011 linkup focused
                                         on enhancing asphalt shingle carpet and mattress recycling for
                                         example linkup hosted a mattress recycling summit that brought
                                         together partners to learn about mattress recycling opportunities
                                         since mattress recycling became available in king county mattresses
                                         delivered directly to the cedar hills regional landfill have decreased
mattress recycling                       by approximately 60 percent

                      another innovative effort focused on improving recycling and sustainability best
                       practices is the ecoconsumer public outreach program this program includes the
                       regular ecoconsumer column in the seattle times as well as numerous tv and radio
                       appearances nearly 30 public presentations were made in 2011

preparing for climate change impacts
 the king county flood control district is improving
  floodplain management to minimize the impacts of
  flooding in 2011 the district completed three flood
  protection infrastructure projects helped raise the
  elevation of seven homes facilitated relocating five
  chronically flooded houses to higher ground and
  demolished six other chronically flooded houses on
  land that king county had previously purchased

  lands reduce the severity of local climate change
  impacts and also naturally sequester carbon dioxide
  in 2011 king county acquired more than 780 acres of
  natural lands additionally parks volunteers provided
  more than 58000 hours of service planting more
  than 23000 native plants and removing invasive
  weeds while wlrd planted nearly 60000 plants
  the county also supported private stewardship
  efforts for example 720 privately owned acres were
  enrolled into king conservation district farm or rural
  stewardship plans

outreach education collaboration training
 in 2011 executive constantine kicked off the

 in 2011 through the responding to climate change brownbag series and the
  greentools sustainable cities roundtables king county led more than 25 educational
  events that reached hundreds of city and county staff on climaterelated project and
  program successes and challenges

 the wastewater treatment division used its new biosolids brand loop as a tool

challenges and opportunities
the scope and scale of climate change impacts facing the region are daunting king county
residents businesses and local governments face diverse and increasingly severe impacts
from rising sea levels decreased snowpack and increased flooding

beyond the scale of the direct impacts that king county faces a key challenge will be to
sustain the level of action and commitment to achieve king countys greenhouse emissions
reduction target of at least 80 percent below 2007 levels by 2050  the amount scientists
tell us is necessary on a global scale to avoid some of the most catastrophic impacts of
climate change

despite these challenges exciting opportunities are emerging the recent ghg emissions in
king county report highlights opportunities for new climate solutions for example in 2012
the solid waste division will implement a pilot project to reducing wasted food that could
potentially serve as a model for broader foodrelated efforts


looking forward
nearterm actions and commitments related to achieving king countys climate change
goals are outlined in the 2012 king county climate motion and the 2012 strategic climate
action plan implementing the priorities and strategies identified by these plans is the key
recommendation for king county through 2013

background
king county has a long history of energy efficiency and energy smart action the king
county council adopted the countys energy plan in october 2010 ordinance 13368
recommitting the county to aggressive goals for energy savings and renewable energy use

the energy plan directs all departments and divisions to save energy and to obtain as
much of their energy as practical from renewable resources divisions are responsible for
using the energy plan strategies to develop specific plans to achieve the countys goals
an interdepartmental energy task force coordinates and supports these plans and reports
progress to the executive and county council during the 2012 update of the king county

challenges and opportunities
saving energy remains a top priority for king countys diverse governmental operations
significant progress in facilities and operations was made in 2011 as the county is close
to meeting its reduction goals as for renewable targets the county continues to pursue
aggressive and proactive efforts to help achieve its 2012 renewable energy targets with the
cedar hills and west point cogeneration projects scheduled to be fully operational in 2012
the countys renewable energy production should exceed the stated goals

the county continues its efforts to achieve 2015 vehicle energy reduction targets but
this continues to be a challenge given the fact that 81 percent of the vehicle energy use
is attributed to metro transit there are several contributing factors to metros increased
fuel consumption chief among these is the conversion of the fleet to larger buses to
accommodate and increase ridership additionally numerous other factors contributed to
this such as loss of engine performance due to aging additional energy consuming features
on new buses and conversion of electric trolleybuses to diesel coaches

financial support technical and management resources willingness to try different
approaches and ongoing management support are required by all divisions to achieve
the targets

king county must continue to focus on reducing energy consumption in its operational
practices using creative financial mechanisms such as utility incentives energy savings
performance contracting and lowinterest federal bonds to implement energy reduction
efforts during these challenging fiscal times and to keep the county on track

looking forward
king county continues to push for continuous improvements in energy efficiency in all areas
of county operations below are some of the key areas of focus in 2012

 employee education the 2010 energy plan provides key strategies to identify energy
  saving changes in operations and prioritize capital investments that will provide the
  greatest benefit the county plans to implement an energy efficiency training series
  for operations and project managers in 2012 and begin a countywide resource
  conservation effort to improve employees awareness of the goals strategies and the
  impact of individual actions on the environment and bottom line

 data systems managers are expected to support operations staff in monitoring energy
  use and optimizing operations based on detailed knowledge of facility energy use in
  2012 the county will review existing data systems processes and uses to assess
  energy data system needs the energy task force will develop a data plan with the goal
  of aggregating energy and resource data into one system and provide staff with the
  training and expectations on using this important information in order to accomplish this
  effort the system investment and supporting resources must be made a high priority

 community collaboration the county will continue to participate in local regional
  and national efforts and collaborate with communities on adding more electric vehicle
  charging stations installing community solar installations and supporting district
  energy opportunities

 financial mechanisms the county will further explore establishing mechanisms for
  financing the upfront capital costs of energy efficiency investments documenting
  savings through energy accounting and creating incentives for agencies to reinvest
  savings in further energysaving projects these steps are key to continuous
  improvement additionally integrating these energy expectations into the budget
  process helps to ensure budgets are aligned with the key strategies to improve energy
  efficiency 2012 budget direction to agencies will include direction for inclusion of
  specific proposals to meet energy efficiency targets finally developing future year
  energy cost forecasts and a mechanism to update them annually are also key initiatives
  to continue this effort sections must apply this same approach to project and
  operational efforts

background
the intent of the green building and sustainable development ordinance 16147 is to
ensure that the design construction maintenance and operation of any king countyowned
or financed capital project is consistent with the latest green building and sustainable
development practices

the ordinance requires eligible county projects to be leed gold certified or to apply the
king county sustainable infrastructure scorecard the green building team comprised of
representatives from king county departments is charged with helping countywide projects
achieve the highest possible standards of green building

the ordinance also directs the greentools program to provide technical support for the
countys green building team as well as to cities and county residents as appropriate

challenges and opportunities
an ongoing challenge is the need for better quantitative data to effectively monitor progress
and performance measures county agencies need a streamlined and consistent database
that contains comprehensive project tracking information

king county can continue its national leadership in public sector green building and
operation efforts with the renewal of green building and sustainable development
ordinance in 2013 developing policy content will begin in 2012

green building practices should continue to be mainstreamed into county actions such
as the countywide capital project program budget direction and the project information
center database division database systems can be modified to include or expand their
sustainability criteria for more efficient tracking


looking forward
 division management should continue to actively support and incentivize project
  managers to implement sustainability practices to the greatest extent possible in all their
  capital and operating projects

 continue to develop a framework for documenting and reinvesting energy resource
  and financial savings resulting from divisionled initiatives that reduce the countys
  environmental footprint which can help to incentivize continuous improvement

 county divisions should prioritize adopting a green om manual to implement operation
  practices that will save king county funding

 link operations and capital budgets in one fund to better evaluate life cycle cost
  alternatives and pursue truly sustainable buildings and infrastructure

 look forward and plan for more innovative green building or operations projects such as
  pursuing the living building challenge

 environmental purchasing program



background
king countys environmentally preferable products purchasing policy kcc 1820
originally established in 1989 was updated in 2011 to include revisions for paper
reduction and purchase of 100 percent recycled paper electronics recycling and reporting
requirements and directs county agencies to buy environmentally preferable products
whenever practicable

environmentally preferable purchasing epp is defined by the environmental protection
agency as products and services having a lesser or reduced effect on human health and the
environment when compared with competing products that serve the same purpose this
comparison may consider raw materials acquisition production manufacturing packaging
distribution reuse operation maintenance or disposal of the product

the department of executive services environmental purchasing program is responsible
for implementing this policy and offers county employees information and technical
assistance to help them find economical and effective alternative products that meet
environmental requirements

in the past year king county agencies purchased 60 million worth of environmentally
preferable products saving 154 million compared to the cost of conventional products
the savings are typically found in reduced initial purchase cost and avoided replacement
cost due to durability oftentimes there are even more savings through less maintenance
reduced energy and water use or reduced greenhousegas emissions these savings are
quantified to the greatest extent possible and are included in this report

                               year by purchasing fewer cases of paper and receiving better pricing under the
                               new copy paper contract

                 the paper policy is supported by both the king county executive and county council and it
                 will help county agencies meet the strategic goals for environmental sustainability if county
                 agencies convert their remaining purchases of copy paper to 100 percent recycled content

lighting
the energy task force completed the 2012 lighting
implementation plan in response to ordinance 16769 that was
issued to ensure compliance with new 2012 federal energy
efficiency lighting standards the plan is a guide for king
county agencies on creating plans to replace or retrofit lighting
fixtures with more energyefficient lamps and ballasts to take
advantage of utility rebates ahead of federal phaseout laws and
                                                                       taxiway led lighs
to shield outdoor lighting to prevent outdoor light pollution from
county facilities the plan also summarizes efforts to acquire
energyefficient lamps with reduced mercury and recycle lamps
containing mercury

county agencies including facilities management division
transit division and parks and recreation have completed
several projects at various facilities including at the component
supply center and the weyerhaeuser king county aquatic
center upgrading to more efficient fluorescent lamps and lighting
controls the airport marine and transit divisions installed light
emitting diodes leds for over 320 taxiway lights and 13 signs
a trial light at pier 50 and bus headlamps respectively leds are
long lasting and energy efficient which far outweigh their initial
cost many more energy efficient lighting upgrades and the use
of leds are planned for 2012 at several maintenance facilities       pier 50 led lighting

king county procurement and contract services worked with the state of washington
on a new contract for lamps and ballasts awarded in june 2011 meeting the new 2012
federal energyefficiency requirements in addition to price the bids were evaluated on
several noncost environmental factors including longlife lamps and reduced mercury and
                                       lead referencing mercury limits set by the european
                                       unions restriction of hazardous substances

                                          king county has been recycling mercurycontaining
                                          fluorescent lamps from its own facilities since 2000
                                          in the past year king county recycled thousands of

challenges and opportunities
a major challenge to expanding the purchase of additional categories of environmentally
preferable products is the lack of consensusbased standards and independent third
party certifications for many products greenwashing or false claims of environmental
preferability of products available in the marketplace is another issue that must
be considered

king county addresses these challenges by participating in the public process for
consensusbased standards and referencing these environmental standards and third
party certifications where applicable when specifying many products such as paper
green cleaners energy efficient equipment and sustainable carpet every year county
agencies purchase more green certified products such as epeat registered computers
green seal certified cleaners energy star equipment and forest stewardship council
certified paper

in addition continued support and priority for epp is needed to ensure that the countys
sustainability goals are met and that it is integrated fully with other environmental programs
consistent messaging at all levels of management and continued work with other
jurisdictions and national organizations are opportunities to expand the program and learn
about other successful policies and programs


looking forward
 implement paper and electronics recycling legislation passed in 2011

 use recommendations from the 2012 ghg emissions study on king county
  geographical emissions as they relate to county purchasing of goods and services and
  implement targeted approaches to further reductions in ghgs in purchasing

 establish a contract for sustainable flooring products and installation  work with the
  city of seattle and us communities on a national contract for carpet and other flooring

 continue partnerships with responsible purchasing network and naco green
  purchasing taskforce including acquiring a summer intern to assist with green
  purchasing efforts and

 update epp policy to align with overall environmental sustainability goals and
  other policies

           climate change cost benefit


      king county ordinance 20120049 requires this report include information about all
      expenses associated with the climate change program and a costbenefit analysis of
      the program


      approach and cost of climate change program
      the 2008 king county comprehensive plan established a longterm ghg emissions
      reduction goal and includes policies calling for actions to assess and reduce climate
      pollution and prepare for the impacts of climate change the king county strategic plans
      environmental sustainability goal and objectives also include a focus on reducing climate
      pollution and preparing for the impacts of climate change on the environment human
      health and economy the countys climate change program is led out of the department of
      natural resources and parks dnrp where there are currently one full time and one term
      limited staff position the 2012 budget for these two positions is 190275 including salary
      and benefits

      the actions needed to carry out climaterelated comprehensive plan policies and strategic
      plan goals and objectives intersect with the roles and work of multiple departments and
      divisions in king county in order to integrate actions and pool technical resources across
      county agencies these dnrp climate program staff work closely with climate focused
      teams supporting development and implementation of county directives related to climate
      change the interdisciplinary climate teams bring together additional county staff focused
      on complementary tasks such as implementing the energy plan the green building and
      sustainable development policy and the environmental purchasing program

      the county also pools resources for climaterelated technical assessments eg ghg
      emissions inventories public outreach and program development with cities through the
      sustainable cities roundtable king countycities climate collaboration and through
      professional associations like climate communities and icleilocal governments for
      sustainability membership in these types of organizations gives king county staff ready
      access to information on local government approaches to reducing climate pollution and
      preparing for climate changes federal and state grant programs and changing regulatory
      requirements dues for these organizations were approximately 15000 in 2011


      benefits of climate change program
      supporting implementation of a diverse range of climate changerelated projects and
      programs such as those highlighted in this report have direct climate changerelated
      benefits and also other benefits such as reducing water pollution creating new local green
      jobs and enhancing residents quality of life specific examples of benefits include



      38        toward a sustainable prosperous king county                 2011 annual report

 helping secure additional revenue to support related county projects and programs
  examples include two grants that run through 2012 in partnership with the national
  wildlife federation king county was awarded a 135346 grant from the united
  states forest service to implement the urban and community forestry climate
  preparedness and response project developing tools for private landowners to learn
  about the relationship between climate change and their forests and to connect them
  to resources to support forest stewardship additionally king county was awarded a
  62 million energy efficiency and conservation block grant from the department of
  energy which prioritizes projects that reduce ghg emissions king county is using
  this grant to support 23 projects such as energy efficiency retrofits of county facilities
  electric vehicle infrastructure installations and planning efforts and paying for energy
  efficiency components of affordable housing projects climate related staff were directly
  responsible for helping secure administer and implement these and other external
  revenue sources

 increasing efficiency of county operations significant cost savings and new revenue
  sources have been achieved through climate related projects that reduce ghg
  emissions by minimizing energy waste and resource expenditures and by creating
  new resources such as renewable energy for example the facilities management
  division fmd has implemented various energy efficiency projects that reduced
  their ghg emissions by almost half from 2007 to 2011 with these projects fmds
  energy costs were also reduced by more than 17 million annually between 2008 and
  2011 similar accomplishments and cost savings have been accomplished by other
  king county divisions

 mitigating future climate change impacts a key benefit of the climate change program
  relates to minimizing and avoiding climate change risks by integrating climate change
  science into the planning and design of diverse projects and programs for example the
  wastewater treatment division has been integrating sea level rise data into wastewater
  infrastructure design and operations while it is hard to quantify the financial value
  of making these forward making decisions it is likely significant for example the
  washington state department of ecologys impacts of climate change on washingtons
  economy concluded that if ghg emissions are not reduced and proactive steps to
  minimize impacts are not taken the annual washington state price tag of climate change
  impacts will be at least 38 billion by 2020

there are other lessquantifiable benefits related to the climate change program county
council and executive leadership on the issue improving relations with king county
cities through regional collaboration improving the quality of life and health of our
residents helping residents and businesses save money on energy and resource costs
supporting community and business environmental and climate efforts and achieving other
environmental sustainability related objectives the overall conclusion is that the financial
and environmental benefits of this program significantly outweigh its costs
