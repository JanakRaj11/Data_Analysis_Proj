                     will be the first leedcertified building in the mexican
                     state of sonora in this waterstressed region the local
                     operations team and te design team understood how
                     crucial it was to design an operation that conserved as
                     much water as possible together they incorporated
                     water usage efficiencies in both the building design and
                     operations and the hard work paid off the site
