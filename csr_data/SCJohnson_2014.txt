the choices we make
sc johnson 2014 public sustainability report

a message from
the chairman and ceo
at sc johnson we have long believed in continuously improving our
products and making the best ingredient choices based on available
science our first decision to unilaterally remove a major chemical was to
eliminate chlorofluorocarbons from our products 40 years ago based on
emerging science about their negative impact in the 1990s we created a
brownlist system where we started identifying and voluntarily removing
from our products ingredients that didnt meet our standards

then in 2001 we developed a process where instead of only focusing
on eliminating the bad we would also focus on adding in better by
continuously improving the chemicals in our products we called this
greenlist and we created a systematic computerized process around
it that has helped us make better ingredient choices

just as important the sc johnson greenlist process helped cement
the path of transparency that has fortified our sustainability progress over
the years in fact as we were completing this report we announced yet           we certainly continue learning as we progress our greenlist initiatives
another important transparency initiative  productspecific fragrance            but its a process we consider to be incredibly important for the company
ingredient disclosure  which is explained on page 29                            and our ability to make products that families can trust

this is the companys 23rd year of publicly reporting progress on                 like every organization sc johnson continues to evolve in order to
sustainability objectives we dont always achieve our goals and we              meet the challenges and opportunities around us but we also work
make mistakes like any other company but we believe in communicating             hard to ensure our fundamental values never change among these
our results and being honest about our choices                                   are integrity transparency and sustainability  enduring commitments
                                                                                  that i am honored to share with the people of this company together
this year our sustainability report includes a special section on the            we are working to do whats right and to safeguard the future for
sc johnson greenlist process in keeping with our commitment to                  generations to come
transparency we are publishing for the first time the list of materials
we consider to be restricted for our products in addition we share
examples of how our sc johnson greenlist scenario planning tool
enables our product formulators to quickly and effectively explore
many product opportunities                                                       h fisk johnson chairman and ceo

 sc johnson defines zero landfill as eliminating all materials that would be transferred to landfills through reuse and recycling and ultimately without the use of incineration



     for more than a decade a critical foundation of our environmental strategy has been our sc johnson greenlist
     process which helps us continuously improve our products following is a special 18page section highlighting the
     sc johnson greenlist process and after that a report on our progress over the past year read on to learn more

a systematic sciencebased ingredient selection and
tracking process that drives continuous and measurable
improvement and is guided by principles of what we
will and will not do

a new way for
better ingredient choices
following a decade of voluntarily and often unilaterally removing from      when we create a new product or reformulation we work to select
our products chemicals that didnt meet our standards the sc johnson         raw materials rated better or best when existing products are
greenlist process formally launched in 2001 the goal was to go beyond       reformulated the formulator must include ingredients that have
taking out bad ingredients and instead focus on choosing better           ratings equal to or higher than the original formula while no system
options and continuously improving formulas based on information              is perfect we continue to revisit and refine the sc johnson greenlist
about ingredients impact on the environment and human health                process to drive ongoing progress

the nowpatented process includes ratings for all of the ingredients we       importantly the sc johnson greenlist process also includes a
use globally other than those in newlyacquired products that are still       robust reporting system that tracks scores at the product division and
being evaluated the process expanded in 2007 to include packaging            corporate level our goal is to increase yearonyear the percentage of
materials as well it uses a computerized product scenario planning        our ingredients that has a lower impact on the environment and human
tool that enables formulators and packaging engineers to compare              health we started with 18 percent betterbest ingredients in 2001
multiple potential product formulas and packaging options                    today we are at 47 percent and our goal is 58 percent by 2016



  heres an overview of our progress in increasing the use of betterbest ingredients due to ongoing advances in measurement changes in our
  product portfolio and increasing numbers of ingredients and materials being measured data may not always reflect applestoapples comparisons
  yearonyear also scores after 2011 reflect combined formula and package score prior to 2011 scores are formula only totals are rounded

the sc johnson greenlist process
how it works
our sc johnson greenlist process depends on a rigorous scoring
process and principles and it starts with an annual review of ingredient
scoring whats known as the annual material review meeting convenes
each year with our chairman and ceo chief sustainability officer and
vice president of global safety assessment and regulatory affairs

their review looks at existing materials since scores may need to be
updated due to new scientific findings or other factors and also at
new materials being added to sc johnsons approved materials library
factors considered include external influences such as new scientific
data on materials public perception and industry best practices
as well as internal factors such as updates to existing scores

establishing material scores                                                     	progress can be controversial the sc johnson greenlist

a materials classification determines the criteria by which it is scored         incredibly monumental and complicated task given that
for example a surfactant is scored on criteria including potential aquatic        we had literally tens of thousands of raw materials and

factors each criterion has specific data ranges to classify it as best
better or good for example to be classified by sc johnson as                 classify them
best for ultimate biodegradability an ingredient has to biodegrade
at least 60 percent within a 10day window

suppliers that demonstrate a higher level of environmental responsibility
such as iso 14001 certification to receive a best score for this criterion                                 h fisk johnson chairman and ceo
the supplier must be iso 14001 certified or a minimum of the ingredients                                  and sc johnson greenlist process founder
they supply must be considered preferred materials

gaining consumer and competitive advantages                                 rolling up results
along with helping sc johnson continually improve products we believe      once we have determined scores for each of the individual criteria
our sc johnson greenlist process gives us marketplace and competitive      for a particular ingredient its overall material score is generated by
advantages too explains chief sustainability officer kelly semrau        averaging the sum of the criteria scores material scores allow formulators
of course we will work to stay on top of the science and phase out         and packaging engineers to measure and track the choices they make
ingredients about which troubling new science arises  thats the point     for example the formula score for a particular product is based on
of scientific research and the sc johnson greenlist process but          a weighted average of the formulas material scores excluding water
in addition by listening to input such as public sentiment we can get
out ahead of other concerns as well such as perceptions that while not    using sc johnson greenlist data material scores and other scores
sciencebased are so powerful they could hurt trust in certain products   we are able to measure results at the product level at the division
by including these types of insights in the sc johnson greenlist process   level such as home cleaning air care or pest control and at the total
too we can potentially make moves before our competitors do  if they      corporate level our current target goal is to achieve a 58 percent
are solely looking at the science  and thats another advantage          corporate betterbest score by 2016

principles for

at sc johnson we screen for about 4600 materials as part of our            importantly this list represents internal sc johnson policy it is not
regular ingredient evaluation process about 2500 of those are materials    intended to indicate regulatory requirements and it does not indicate
that could potentially have negative impacts according to regulatory         an assessment of risk to humans or the environment from any
and government bodies as a result we specify that many of them             particular product
cannot be used at all and some can only be used at a highly restricted
level the other 2100 are materials we generally avoid because there        heres a look at the 0rated materials list

first its important to note that if an exception is granted it is because   this is engineered or manufactured nanomaterials
despite the fact that we have questions about the ingredient here at
sc johnson evidence suggests it can be used safely at certain levels
which we do not exceed in that case we might grant an exception               q  beyond the 0rated materials list are there any
for reasons such as                                                            other groups of ingredients that sc johnson avoids
 we discover a supplier is adding a 0rated ingredient to something           like all responsible manufacturers we avoid pbts ingredients or ingredi

ingredients that a formulator might logically consider for inclusion in a       out whats left of it so using a virtually limitless synthetic might be more

using the
data
among the important value provided by the sc johnson greenlist
process is the ability it gives us to track our progress across products
divisions and as a corporation overall company leaders can use this
information to guide decision making related to formulation priorities
and packaging opportunities as we work toward our 2016 goals

but its at the formulator and packaging engineer level where the
process truly makes an impact every day thats where sc johnson
product developers use the sc johnson greenlist scenario planning
tool to simplify the complex process of calculating scores and
exploring opportunities

the idea says chairman and ceo fisk johnson is to foster insights         learning as we go
at the lab bench we wanted to systematize scenario planning              despite the positive response the sc johnson greenlist process has
to make it easy for scientists to explore different options when theyre    earned in some areas we are not perfect and continue to learn from
in the lab actually creating the products                                 mistakes as well in 2010 sc johnson reached an agreement on two
                                                                            lawsuits regarding use of our greenlist logo on us windex products
scenario planning for progress                                              the company agreed to stop using the logo in its current form on
the sc johnson greenlist scenario planning tool is an interactive          windex products and the parties agreed to an undisclosed settlement
computer system that automatically calculates scores drawing data          while we believed we had a strong legal case in retrospect we could
directly from the companys approved materials library database            have been more transparent about what the logo signified

as formulators enter potential ingredients the tool automatically
generates a material score summary betterbest summary case weight
summary material rating breakdowns weight summaries and more
it provides similar data for packaging options                               the sc johnson greenlist scenario planning tool lets me
                                                                                evaluate different packaging materials early in the process
the result is a scenario planning summary sheet which details                  for example when i entered packaging information into
a betterbest comparative overview for up to three different product
                                                                                the tool for a recent project the betterbest score was
scenarios including both formula and package product scenarios
can be generated in a matter of minutes helping quickly identify

opportunities for improvements                                                 a supplier who is iso 14001 certified i was able to raise
                                                                                the product impact betterbest score to 95 percent
this means that as we develop the great products families have come
to expect from sc johnson we can ensure that both consumer expecta                                             mark woodward sr associate

teams making a difference
among sc johnsons key learnings in the pursuit of reduced waste is the
importance of employee participation at our brantford canada facility
employees formed teams to identify and remove process steps that
create waste the facility also eliminated garbage cans and introduced
centrally located recycling stations which encourages recyclables
reaching the appropriate containers
