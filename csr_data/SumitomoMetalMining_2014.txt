                     that the smm group needs to address                    by exercising its onsite strengths i think it will be important for

        and smelting  refining businesses too we are up against an

                                                                                         business in emerging nations

        hardtoprocess ores caused a strained supply of metal                       in some countries we are seeing a new trend toward

          we the smm group certainly have a role to play in                        new mining law effective since january 2014 which
        contributing to the resolution of these social issues through our    prohibits exports of unprocessed ore in light of this trend i
        core business already we have been working to lower our             believe there is now an even greater need to build solid
        environmental impact for example through use of lowgrade           relationships of trust between countries and regions in
        nickel ore recovery of rare metals and a focus in the materials   possession of resources and those like us who carry out
        business on the environment and energy fields these efforts        development and operate in those places having the trust of

        regard to technology on site and our salespersons                  us permission to operate a mine smelter or refinery there i
        the fact that our commercial application of highpressure acid       strongly feel that we need to return to the principles of the

shall place prime importance on integrity and focus even          the sumitomo business spirit is there to support us with those
more on building relationships of trust with local communities    decisions and actions it is more than just a slogan i look at it as
  to help us do that not only are we continuing efforts in        a backbone a trunk around which employees of the smm
development and operations to achieve zero environmental           group mold their conduct helping to shape the most
contamination and minimize negative impacts we are                fundamental aspects of their character i too am constantly
advancing initiatives that will contribute to regional             learning from the history of sumitomo as i go about my job and
development over the long term such as promotion of               the sumitomo business spirit is so profound that i am still only
employment improvement of facilities at schools hospitals and    halfway toward fully understanding it gradually coming to
other infrastructure and development of human resources           terms with the various aspects the sumitomo business spirit
through scholarship programs knowing that mining smelting        does not only refer to those things that can be explained in
and refining are all longterm businesses which span several       words for example the vicinity of the old besshi copper
decades and in particular that in emerging nations smmʼs          mineformerly run by the sumitomo family then finally taken
businesses are a form of community development i view it is as    over and closed by smmhas been restored to its natural state
our duty to develop alongside the community                       so much so that it is hard to imagine there was once a town
                                                                   there where many people who worked at the mine lived this
                                                                   was achieved through the efforts of our forerunners who

 q3
           what is the current status of the 2012 3year           practiced the principle included in the sumitomo business
           business plan and what is the outlook                  spirit of paying back nature with gratitude for its bounties
                                                                   through reforestation and other measures as the saying goes it


a                                                                  is far better to see with your own eyes and so the fact that this
         in the 2012 3year business plan we have put forward
         becoming a world leader in the nonferrous metals         legacy remains for us to witness makes it a very valuable asset

 q4        what do you wish to instill to employees
           as the essence of csr


a       i think the essence of csr comes down to the actions
        that employees ordinarily choose to take as individual
        human beings and individual members of the smm
        group that simultaneously requires the development of
a vision for businesses and a corporate culture that are
characteristic of sumitomo metal mining it is important that
employees have contact with society and readily engage in
communication with people around them and by doing so
come to understand and sympathize with others and to share
and resonate with others while constantly thinking about how
they should act

  other sumitomo group companies are also globalizing                 and ﬁnance but i believe this third article stressing the

   besides overcoming these technical issues a number of                    strengths as a combination of all three
smms unique advantages contributed to the success of
mass production
   the ﬁrst was the persistence of smms development
engineers including abe in insisting upon considerations for
future mass production this was based upon the
understanding that a product will only be able to make a
contribution to the company to customers and to society
once it can be mass produced an important point that abe                                             by mass producing materials the market
too stressed to his employees                                                                        needs at low cost i hope we create
   the second advantage was that smm smelted and reﬁned                                                more employment and thereby make a
nickel from the ore stage and therefore had the ability to                                             contribution to the city of niihama where

   the third advantage was that smm was already in                                                     head of the nca project dept materials div

basic approach

smm group business centers on the utilization of the earths valuable yet limited resources effective use of resources
is therefore considered an important issue for management as we seek sustainable business development based on this
understanding the smm group has included effective use of resources as one of its six key csr areas and is
advancing recycling efforts as the vision for 2020 depicts a company that generates resources using innovative
technology we are developing technologies that will assist with the effective utilization of minerals which have not
previously been converted into resources such as lowgrade and complex ores we are also endeavoring to recover
precious and other valuable metals from items such as used home appliances and electronic devices and develop and

progress in fy2013
in fy2013 the development of copper resources at sierra gorda chile and nickel production in taganito in
the philippines were projects of high significance the key here is the development of technology for
recovering as many valuable metals as possible from lowgrade ores and putting them to effective use for
example besides establishing technology for economically recovering the mere 1 nickel content from nickel
ores we have started operation of a pilot plant in the philippines where we carry out verification testing of
technology with the aim of recovering as much of the 40 iron and 12 chromium content in residues
employing our own original technologies to make effective use of resources is the very heart of our business
and we believe that we can both contribute to society and enhance our corporate value by pursuing this in a
sincere manner
response to stakeholder comments
making effective use of resources along the entire supply chain is another issue we must consider nickel
extracted from ores is used to make lithium nickel oxide a cathode material for secondary batteries used in
automobiles we have developed technology and worked with customers to establish a system for recycling
allowing us to retrieve materials from batteries that have reached the end of their lives and turn them into new       harumasa kurokawa

          the raw material used at the plant is lowgrade nickel                                            humankind we hope to further reﬁne the hpal technology
        oxide ore which had previously been underutilized using                                            so that we can utilize earths limited resources even more
        the hpal technique to turn this ore into resources also has                                         effectively
        tremendous social signiﬁcance
          initially after startup the plant went through various kinds
        of hardships in establishing operating conditions suited to
        the properties of the taganito ore but thanks to the united
        efforts of japanese and filipino workers these hardships
        were overcome and now the plant is operating smoothly

basic approach

many potentially harmful substances are handled by smm group businesses during mineral resource processing and
manufacturing even a small accident carries the risk of seriously affecting local people and the environment in order to
ensure that this risk never materializes smm group emphasizes the need to prevent contamination by supplying
equipment and management systems and by providing training for relevant staff members
   every year drills are held in order to learn how to minimize the effects and prevent external impacts in the unlikely event
an incident did occur we have also worked to improve facilities and we are installing a system that automatically shuts off
the discharge if any abnormalities are detected just before the wastewater port we will continue to control environmental
risks properly and to strengthen our activities toward risk reduction

progress in fy2013
measures dealing with the issue of global warming such as those promoting the conservation of energy are an
important social responsibility that companies ought to fulfill nevertheless there are getting fewer and fewer
highly effective energysaving measures in which investment decisions can be made based primarily on
business profitability and in fy2013 alone our unit energy consumption ended up worsening in part due to the
effects of a scheduled suspension of operations going forward i believe we should promote investment
decisions that consider a variety of merits on a comprehensive companywide basis as for products that
contribute to energy savings our products including wiring materials used in led lighting and other applications
have been recognized for their high efficiency and have become more widespread during fy2013 also our
positive electrode material for secondary batteries is being used in new electric vehicles and sales are growing
response to stakeholder comments
while i agree that environmental impact assessments of the entire material cycle are important since we are an
upstream business it is quite difficult to conduct such assessments as for our scope for reducing co2
emissions further we are studying the possibility of conducting assessments using a simplified method based          takashi sugiura
on coefficients for each product application we are also considering utilizing renewable energy in collaboration     chairman environmental preservation subcommittee

in increasing costs such as the introduction of renewable energy
and switching fuels

   in fy2013 97 kilotons of waste underwent ﬁnal disposal a
 decline of about 14 kilotons from fy2012 iron clinker3 from
 shisaka smelting and zinc slag from the harima smelter
 accounted for the majority of this one major factor in the decline
 was a decrease in the volume of debris generated in the
 dismantling of facilities following completion of the switch to oxide

         basic approach                                                                                       biodiversity considerations
       all diverse living creatures on earth are interconnected either                                      at the smm group we are committed to reducing our impact on
       directly or indirectly and together they weave a magniﬁcent circle                                   biodiversity our view of factors that affect biodiversity includes the
       of life this is biodiversity each living creature plays an important                                various environmental impacts associated with business such as
       role and by interacting with each other and maintaining a                                            the emission of greenhouse gases and chemical substances the
       balance they support the global environment                                                         use of water and the disposal of waste as well as the logging of
         our society is supported by the blessings of nature produced                                        forests and erosion of soil during development projects at mines
       from this biodiversity and in order for future generations to receive                                smelters and reﬁneries and the possession of land associated
       these blessings of nature the same as us it is imperative that                                       with the establishment of facilities
       biodiversity be preserved                                                                              in new projects due consideration is given to the surrounding
         the smm group contributes to creating a prosperous society by                                       environment right from the planning stage as we undertake
       mining ore manufacturing nonferrous metals and various                                              development and operations it is also our basic policy to engage
       materials and supplying them to society at the same time though                                    in adequate communication with citizens of local communities and
       given the characteristics of our business it is unavoidable that we                                  governments at national and regional levels and to disclose
       affect biodiversity both directly and indirectly nevertheless by                                   information where permissible as requested by citizen groups and
       taking this into consideration we can minimize any impact or we                                     other parties during environmental surveys conducted by

         the smm group is moving ahead based on the recognition that                                        development and business activities in a locality will have a

progress in fy2013
smm does business in many different regions both inside and outside japan and we believe we have to
carry out ongoing contribution activities rooted in local areas we spent the equivalent of 1 of recurring
profit on social contribution activities inside and outside japan again in fy2013 and we intend to maintain
that level while seeking close communication with stakeholders and persisting with activities that match
local needs
response to stakeholder comments
developing human resources who are going to sustain the next generation is a major theme of smms
social contribution and in particular it is one aspect of our active efforts to provide support for education
and resolve povertyrelated issues in developing nations where we operate providing assistance to
communities affected by major natural disasters is our other companywide theme and through these two
themes we will practice think globally act locally as systems for encouraging employee participation in
social contribution activities we already have a csr awards system for honoring outstanding activities
and a volunteer leave program but we are also looking into introducing a longterm leave program as a
way to further promote volunteering in social contribution activities and international cooperation by              koji imai

        in peru we were asked by children from a nearby village to                                               picking up litter as they chat and experiencing the
        give a talk on japans advanced science and technology it                                                blessings of nature
        was a chance to visit the village community center and                                                      initially starting out as an activity called creating a
        speak about japans stateoftheart robotics while mixing it                                             society in harmony with nature its aim was for the
        up with some video clips seeing such images for the first                                                development of local industry and symbiosis with the
        time the children listened with great interest                                                          natural environment by getting participants to think about
          in most cases the community contribution wanted by                                                     the signiﬁcance and importance of sorting garbage and
        local residents is economic assistance and it is normal for                                              getting them to see the current state of the tenryu river
        this to be given in the form of the provision of goods                                                   ﬁrsthand it has since developed into a major event with
        however i believe that leaving as many intangible assets                                                 100 companies and 5000 people participating from the

        the true sense of the word education is a notable example                                                  in the ﬁrst year just a few volunteers from shinko co ltd
        of such assets that such a project was implemented at the                                                participated as part of the team from the minowa town
        request of the children themselves was also an unexpected                                                 chamber of commerce  industry there were also some
        joy for us                                                                                               corporate teams comprised of participants from the same
          one child in the audience asked why is it that japanese                                               workplace
        can do these things but we cant i answered with hope                                                    being a company like ours which manufactures printed

     my way of
     doing good
                                  when purchasing goods i make it a point to select from fairtrade products this is because i think that if a
                                  system can be established whereby producers can generate profits producing goods in their own countries
                                  then they can become selfreliant and can get better living conditions
                                   fairtrade a movement that aims to improve living conditions and achieve selfreliance for producers and workers in vulnerable developing countries by purchasing raw
                                    materials and products from those developing countries at a fair price on an ongoing basis

aiming to become a company worthy of being called world leader in the nonferrous metals industry and an
excellent company of japan we made steady progress again in fy2013 on basic initiatives in the form of
human rights training at smm group companies in japan and overseas to firmly instill knowledge about the
smm group human rights policy as well as promotion of diversity at smm for example through hiring of
female management track employees and foreign exchange students and creation of posts that can be filled by
disabled employees we also stepped up our support for the careers of women through ongoing enhancements
to the various programs and implementation of training as a result we were selected for the second
consecutive year as a nadeshiko brand for encouraging female employees to play active roles in the workplace
  furthermore in fy2013 we devised and conducted test runs of a human rights due diligence system for within the
smm group in fy2014 we will begin fullscale implementation of the system conducting ongoing studies to
determine the level of human rights awareness and to identify any related issues in the contexts of the smm group
human rights policy and international standards such as iso 26000 appropriate action will be taken as required
additionally in fy2014 we are looking into extending this system to encompass the entire supply chain and plan to
implement due diligence studies prioritizing suppliers according to their higher importance

international employee development
the globalization of business has created a need for human
resources who can actively pursue smms business strategy at
overseas facilities and within markets for each of our main
businesses
  acknowledging that the development of such human resources
needs to start as early as possible smm implements a shortterm
overseas training program whereby all new management track
employees are seconded overseas for a twomonth period more
than just an opportunity to polish up language skills the program
is designed to bring about general improvements to the
employees ability to accommodate other cultures and their ability
to act under their own initiative in an overseas setting
  training in business skills which are perhaps one common                               ledda 3rd from left in front row with members of the personnel dept
language within a global business is also readily incorporated into
the different types of management training and training for
employees promoted to new positions international employee
development is thus approached from a number of angles not
simply from the language aspect

                                                   my observations and guidance at business locations since 2010 that similar problems keep arising although the
                                                   issues do vary from location to location there is a strong desire to deal with them through a united effort of everyone

progress in cy2013
areas we focused on in the occupational health  safety subcommittee in cy2013 were the smm anzen
dojyo seminar for developing leaders who will take charge of health and safety management at sites and risk
assessment education to assist the assessment of and action against risk factors by top executives at each
facility employees attending the anzen dojyo are asked to plan and administrate safety activities matching
the actual circumstances at their own site top executives at workplaces also have stronger awareness now
risk assessments too are continually improved through ongoing dialogue with ordinary workers for example
about ways to deal with remaining risks thereby reducing the number of risk factors this is to ensure that
risks are not simply addressed through initiatives forced on workplaces from above in 2013 while there were
fewer losttime accidents the total number of accidents increased through activities suited to individual sites
i would like to work on preventing accidents before they occur

response to stakeholder comments
in cy2013 we started to review the safety of machines and equipment through joint efforts with the
engineering division we are working to unify rules and standards that will allow us to maintain safety of
equipment at each facility including electrical wiring and piping right from the design stage we will seek                           takashi sugiura

        in conducting activities at the pogo mine safety is regarded as
        paramount importance for everyone needless to say in order
        to carry out operations safely each individual worker must use
        protective equipment properly but they must also understand
        how important their actions are for both themselves and their
        families with this in mind we conduct monthly safety
        campaigns for the purpose of repeatedly raising awareness in
        the workplace for potential risks during these campaigns                                         chris kennedy

        such topics as securing safety systems and preventing                               sumitomo metal mining pogo llc
        recurrent injuries and communicates the results of these
        discussions to all employees through these activities the risk
        awareness of employees was clearly heightened
          in addition by participating in various other meetings and
        engaging in direct dialog with employees and by undertaking
        on site checks as part of their inspections management and
        the health safety and loss control manager are also actively
        involved in the early detection discussion and measures for
        any rule violations through these activities we are working to
        create a workplace where all employees become safe workers                                           steve steel

     my way of
     doing good
                               three years ago i began climbing the 100 steps from the train platform for the yokosuka line on basement level
                               4 to the ticket gate on the ground level at the jr shimbashi station which is the station closest to work
                               although my original intent was to promote my own health since i do not use the escalator i feel like i am also
                               doing my bit albeit small for the conservation of energy and the alleviation of congestion nowadays i routinely
                               use stairs even on my days off

    zinc smelting business with a history spanning 50 years and
    our nickel sulfate business which only commenced operations
    in 2014
      zinc smelting is a drying process dealing with large volumes
    of hightemperature materials and melts1 in addition to                                         fans and a dust counter center used to measure dust particles

    on reporting communicating and consulting at points of                                 environments but not nearly enough consideration was given
    variation through these safety activities the awareness of                            and countermeasures did not necessarily lead to results at
    employees toward safety is gradually changing and our safety                           our plant workers are required to wear masks from control
    performance is also improving                                                          class 2 but in order to improve their work environment we

                                         what is your evaluation of the smm groups activities during fy2013
                                         the mineral resources business and smelting and refining business are businesses with a potentially large impact on
                                         local communities and the environment and that is why it is extremely important to appropriately engage in
                                         communication with local people to gain the understanding and backing of the community on this point it is highly
                                         admirable that individual operating locations are building relationships of trust according to the local circumstances
                                         as demonstrated by taganito hpal nickel corporation thpal and coral bay nickel corporation cbnc holding
                                         regular meetings with ngos is also important as a way to quickly come to terms with potential risks and can be
                                         admired as an indication of smms openness toward the outside in regard to dialogue with individual stakeholders i
                                         believe smm is already achieving a high standard
                                         in your view what does society require in regard to stakeholder communication
                                         first i think it is important for head office to have an accurate grasp of communication activities implemented at
                                         each facility and to strike a balance between adapting to local circumstances and achieving companywide
                                         consistency smm does not simply react passively to demands made by the local community but takes the initiative
                                         in its community contributions even looking beyond the closure of a mine for example in its development of industry
                                         and education of human resources it naturally follows that properly communicating this will increase societys trust

     professor faculty of economics
 takasaki city university of economics   of these activities over and above simply introducing them can assist in the acquisition of stable longterm investors
                                         and greater awareness among employees you already adequately engage in integrated thinking so perhaps
                                         integrated reporting is also now in order

progress in fy2013
in fy2013 we primarily worked to strengthen communication with three stakeholder categoriesemployees
shareholders and investors and citizen groups we endeavored to build relationships with each stakeholder
category for example through employee awareness surveys plant tours and strategy briefings for
shareholders and investors and the hosting of inhouse lectures with the cooperation of ngos these kinds
of initiatives have even been recognized by outside parties as illustrated by our winning a best ir award
hosted by the japan investor relations association
response to stakeholder comments
we have a system in place whereby case examples of initiatives for communicating with the community are
regularly compiled through written surveys and shared with all facilities for example via the inhouse bulletin
while difficulties do arise due to the varying cultures traditions and other background aspects from region to
region i hope we can deploy best practices across the organization where applicable and strengthen
dialogue
  to earn greater trust from society it is also extremely important that we undertake appropriate disclosure of
nonfinancial information there is extensive demand among shareholders and investors in europe and other
overseas locations for integrated reporting which involves reporting on current business activities and future                  takashi ito

resources development subcommittee within the csr
committee started deliberating on implementation of
companywide activities in line with the smm group policy
on human rights in october 2013 and a working group
was set up comprising business divisions which are
responsible for procuring raw materials and the
purchasing department advice is also sought from a
thirdparty organization as a way to incorporate an
objective outlook

for human rights management within the supply chain
enabling all divisions with procurement functions to
engage in activities urging suppliers to show respect for
human rights and prevent human rights violations

          difﬁcult to take in their detail

          partners do


         while i understand space is limited i think the report would be
           easier to understand if it was made more visual                              we have reduced the number of topics that appear and we
         the font is small and hard to read maybe too much detail has                    have made the photos and character fonts larger
           been packed into the report
                                                                                         we have maintained the questionandanswer format again this
         the qa method used in the digest version for explaining what                    year we have also included an introduction of the csr
           csr is was easy to understand future reports should keep this                  communication support ofﬁcers assigned to each business
           section because every year there are new employees and                          division if there is anything about csr that you are wondering
           others who are reading the csr report for the ﬁrst time                        about or want to know please contact a csr communication
                                                                                           support ofﬁcer or the csr committee secretariat

         having a history spanning 400 years is an advantage unique to                  in order to further deepen readers understanding about the
           smm and so i think it was good to emphasize this in terms of                   smm group this year we put together a special feature on the
           smms 400year legacy                                                        sumitomo business spirit

         having read the special feature on quality i understand that                in this years report we have created a page on smms
           high quality and production capacity are important but it would                approach to manufacturing focusing on one product the
           be better to communicate how they help in the outside world                    article touches on how our products are used in the world

                                                                                         the subcommittee chairpersons were interviewed based on the

           seem to match what the outside experts say in their
                                                                                           in 2013 and 2014 and their views have been published in this

         there are many foreign words written either in english or in                  effort was made to make the katakana english and technical
           katakana there are also some technical terms that i do not                     terms easier to understand by adding explanatory notes
           understand                                                                     wherever possible
