manage wastes and hazardous
materials responsibly
waste is a key issue for singapore as a small island nation with                                        hazardous waste generation
limited land space and a growing population we need to be very                                                   tonnes
mindful of the waste that we generate since the 1970s the amount
of solid waste disposed of in singapore has increased sixfold1                      2000
as one of the leading companies in singapore we aim to lead by
example and play our part in managing waste responsibly                              1500
our priority is to reduce the amount of waste that we generate at the
workplace we adopt a twopronged approach at the company and                         1000
individual levels for example we promote personal responsibility
like encouraging our people to bring their own water bottles or mugs
to meetings instead of using the biodegradable disposable cups that                   500

                          the staff access card on the network printer and            of ncs cafeteria waste from fy1011

users can also choose to delete documents that were mistakenly                                        nonhazardous waste generation

responsibly this year we reduced our hazardous waste generation
by 14 mainly through the reduction of scrap copper cables we
reduced our scrap copper cable waste by 46                                                              fy0910                                 fy1011

a key environmental initiative introduced during the year
is project less with the tagline its time we did less 
to protect our planet
                        singtel project less environmental campaign

                        launched on 1 march 2010 the eightweek

                        less  little eco steps  among our staff
                        and customers to adopt simple green acts
                        to care for our environment we hope to
                        reduce our carbon footprint by spreading
                        the ethos that little acts can collectively
                        make a big difference
we organised numerous activities for our people to participate
actively in this campaign including sharing of green tips by
our people and management members a photo contest with
environment in focus as its theme and an ecotrip to the
newater visitor centre to understand the water challenges
we face as a nation our annual plantatree day became a
