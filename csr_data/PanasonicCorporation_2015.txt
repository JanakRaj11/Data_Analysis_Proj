                                       there is much discussion today regarding social responsibility but while the meaning of
                                       that concept can be wideranging depending on social conditions at a particular time the
                                       fundamental social responsibility of a corporation in any era should be to improve society
                                       through its business activities it is extremely important to manage all business activities based
                                       on this sense of mission

basic framework
panasonic has three levels of management cycles for risk management the gg risk management committee four
panasonic companies and business divisions each year an assessment of the impact of risks that could affect the
business management of companies and affiliated business divisions is undertaken using a single global set of standards
incorporating the potential impact on business operations probability of risk occurring and other factors steps are then
taken to identify major company risks and to ensure that appropriate countermeasures are implemented taking into
consideration these major company risks the gg risk management committee considers and identifies those major
risks that require attention from a groupwide perspective the gg risk management committee also monitors progress
made concerning countermeasures as a means to improve and strengthen groupwide risk management

initiatives relating to business continuity management bcm
as a public entity of society panasonic management philosophy includes a commitment to contribute to the advancement
of world culture by working to improve the quality of life for all of society through the products that it produces and sells
since 2005 the company has been keenly aware of the necessity to practice business continuity one of the companys
duties to society the goal of these activities is to prevent a break in the supply of products or the provision of services
when contingencies such as disasters have occurred or in the rare eventuality that service has halted to restart operations
as quickly as possible

it is predicted that a major earthquake will probably occur in the relatively near future directly under the tokyo metropolitan
area or in the nankai trough responding to these predictions panasonic has established a crosscompany task force
which promotes disaster response capabilities based on the latest government damage predictions and reviews the
companys bcm more specifically the task force conducts annual groupwide disaster preparedness training drills and has
established emergency measure headquarters at every level groupwide within the four companies and within business
divisions the task force is also tasked with maintaining and improving panasonics initial response capabilitiesincluding
confirmation of the safety of employees and coordinating among different emergency measure headquarters on the degree
of damage to address potential fires the task force conducts periodic fire risk assessments fire prevention selfchecks
and fire prevention audits and promotes accident prevention by sharing case studies of response measures for firerelated
accidents to assess risks of natural disasters overseas the task force has conducted a hazard survey covering various
risksearthquakes floods tropical depressions tsunamis naturally occurring fires landslides tornadoes and volcanic
eruptions the task force has communicated its findings to each of the four companies in addition the task force uses
hazard maps to visualize the risks that panasonic locations face and promotes prioritybased response measures

environment policy

environmental policy
contributing to society has been the management philosophy for panasonic ever since its founding and we have been
taking measures against pollution since the 1970s we announced the environmental statement in june 5 1991 clarifying
our approaches to address global environmental issues as a public entity of society since then we have been carrying
out initiatives including matters on global warming prevention and resources recycling corporatewide aiming to attain a
sustainable safe and secure society

in fiscal 2014 the panasonic group introduced a new brand slogan a better life a better world aiming to realize a
better life for all its customers and are promoting environmental initiatives as an important element in achieving that goal
in production activities exhaustive energysaving measures have been implemented in all factories worldwide pushing
for further co2 emissions reduction in our production activities we are also pursuing recyclingoriented manufacturing
for effective utilization of resources one example is the development of a resources recycling and trade scheme together
with our supplier in which scrap iron from used home appliances is recycled into steel plates to be used as material for
products by our group

in addition panasonic has introduced its own indicator called the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions to
strengthen co2 reduction efforts during actual product use until now the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions
had been disclosed to represent the volume of our direct contribution to co2 emissions reduction by cutting down power
consumption during product use through energysaving designs for our key consumer products now we are also engaged
in business development in the areas of housing automotive and btob solutions accordingly more of our products are
being integrated into finished goods and services of other companies contributing to their energysaving performances
for this reason we have defined the co2 emissions reduction effect in these business areas as the size of indirect
contribution to reduction and start disclosing the figures from the fiscal 2015 results

furthermore we define our products and services that accelerate the transition to a sustainable society through the
reduction of environmental impact as strategic green products gps of these we call the products that deliver the
industrys topclass environmental performance super gps by promoting green products we will contribute to further
reduction of co2 emissions




                                                              11

environmental action plan green plan 2018
after the completion of the green plan 2010 which was established in 2001 the green plan 2018 was established in 2010
to clarify our targets for fiscal 2019 from april 1 2018 to march 31 2019 and actions to be taken in order to achieve the
targets furthermore the green plan 2018 was revised in july 2013 followed by the newlyestablished environmental
action guideline

the green plan 2018 will continue our initiatives in five areas co2 reduction resources recycling water chemical
substances and biodiversity we are focusing on maximizing the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions which is
an indicator that represents our efforts for co2 reduction to contribute to making net co2 emissions from the international
community peak and decline thereafter at an earlier timing as for resources recycling we promote higher recycled
resource utilization ratio and factory waste recycling rate as well as create more resources recyclingoriented products
to materialize recyclingoriented manufacturing in addition with respect to ecoconscious products and businesses we
will expand the range of activities to products services and solutions in the btob sector while keeping strengths in the
home appliances field to provide products and services that create environmental value for our customers panasonic will
deepen the collaboration with various partners across the supply chain and accelerate environmental initiatives to extend
better impacts on the society

we will steadily execute this environmental action plan towards achieving our fiscal 2019 targets

and plan and promote their activities accordingly

successful practices challenges in implementation and approaches to midterm to longterm targets at companies and
various regions are shared and discussed at the global environmental working committee meeting held twice a year
which consists of environmental compliance administrators at companies and regional headquarters seeking to enhance
the level of corporatewide environmental sustainability management through the pdca management cycle the progress

in order to further reinforce environmental sustainability management globally we have established ems in all our sites
including nonmanufacturing sites across the world and these sites have certified iso14001 in principle in october
2011 we published the environmental management system establishment guidelines that summarize ems concepts for
different business forms such as manufacturing sales and services and head office administration aiming to build ems in
accordance with the basic rules for environmental affairs on a global scale based on the guidelines groupwide action is
underway to achieve the goals set out in the green plan 2018

furthermore in preparation for the iso 14001 amendments in 2015 inhouse seminars on iso 14001 amendments were
held for environmental operation administrators of companies and factories in december 2014 and march 2015 lecturers
were invited from the japan audit and certification organization for environment and quality jaco to the seminars which
included use of teleconference systems etc with more than 250 people attending the amended iso 14001 is expected
to impose more rigorous demands in environmental management development through business activities identification
of environmental risks not limited to compliance violations and environmental management of such risks the participants
of the seminar not only learned about before and after the amendments of iso
14001 but also shared information and challenges through communication
with the lecturers and discussions among operation administrators the
seminar participants reported they were able to understand the key points of
the amendment and gain deeper understanding through the discussions and
expressed their wish to further study actual cases including more practical
content seminars for practical application and for training internal auditors are
also scheduled even after the iso 14001 amendment activities will be organized
on a continual basis to enable the environmental management system to                                   discussion during the inhouse seminar
function as a more effective scheme

environment environmental risk management

groupwide systems to manage environmental risks
as a tool to continuously reduce environmental risks panasonic has established an environmental risk management
system specific to each company in accordance with the basic risk management policy for all companies see page 8
we promote 1 identification of environmental risks and groupwide risk management each year and 2 ensuring quick
responses to reported environmental risks

to identify environmental risks and implement the management system environmental risks are identified for each
company and for each region in the world each year from these risks environmental risks on a groupwide level are
selected the risks that show a high level of frequency or seriously impact business management are designated as major
risks and prioritized in planning and executing riskreducing measures these measures are implemented for each major
risk and progress is monitored and followed up on a quarterly basis in the pdca cycle

when an environmental risk is found the relevant company related job functions and regional headquarters collaborate
to promptly implement emergency measures and recurrence prevention measures adapted to the risk level also the
management flow in case of risk discovery is standardized to prevent the occurrence of secondary risks as a result of
confusion

environmental compliance management at factories
panasonic manages its environmental systems in full compliance with laws and regulations we regularly measure emissions
of gas wastewater noise odor etc and introduce preventative measures for cases that may lead to serious violations

furthermore key human resources are developed for information sharing among the companiesbusiness divisions
environmentrelated job functions and regional headquarters to ensure exhaustive compliance with legislation related to
factory environment management in respective countries where panasonic manufacturing sites are located specifically
activities to share information as well as specialized training is conducted for factory management officers in charge of the
management of chemical substances waste wastewater and exhaust gas either by country or by region in japan europe
china and southeast asia

in fiscal 2015 there were 2 violations of environmentrelated legislation in japan and 4 outside japan in response they
were reported promptly to the administrative authorities and measures to address the causes were implemented we will
continue to ensure compliance with legislation as well as prevent recurrence

measures against soil and groundwater contamination
in the latter half of the 1980s soil and groundwater contamination due to chlorinated organic solvents was detected at
some of panasonic sites in response we have conducted anticontamination activities across the company specifically
in 1991 we created the manual for preventing contamination of soil and groundwater and began conducting necessary
surveys and measures in 1995 we discontinued the use of chlorinated organic solvents and in 1999 created guidelines
on the prevention of environmental pollution to ensure there would be no recurrence of similar problems at our sites in
fiscal 2003 we began enhancing our surveys and measures to comply with relevant laws and regulations including the
soil contamination countermeasures act which was enforced in japan in 2003 and in fiscal 2004 started implementing
measures to place all our bases across the globe under management supervision with regard to soil and groundwater

specifically we conduct onsite inspections and interviews at the bases in addition to surveying their use of vocs and
heavy metals furthermore we implement surface soil surveys within the premises for the sites where contamination was
detected beyond the regulatory pollution standards we conduct detailed borehole surveys to identify the boundaries of the
contaminated areas and take remedial measures

as a result of these efforts we were able to place all our bases under management supervision in 2008 furthermore in
fiscal 2011 the management supervision scheme was purposespecifically reorganized and reinforced to establish a new
management supervision scheme with the highest priority given to preventing dispersion of pollution beyond our premises
this new scheme is implemented across all operating sites to further improve the level of measures against contamination

in fiscal 2015 three new soil contaminations were detected at panasonic sites as a result of soil surveys in land utilization
reviews we confirmed that there is no possibility of external dispersion however we are conducting measures to
complete the purification

initiatives for pcb pollution
panasonic discontinued the production of equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in japan in 1972 and
has since been strictly managing its pcb waste with the enforcement of the law concerning special measures for
promotion of proper treatment of pcb waste in july 2001 optimized storage decontamination and notifications are
being practiced in compliance with the law 2074 of 2281 units 91 completed including transformers and capacitors
using pcbs submitted under the early registration scheme were treated as of march 31 2015 by japan environmental
storage  safety corporation jesco as our subcontracted pcb waste disposal operator additionally approx 11 tons of
stabilizers and other waste with a high pcb concentration were consigned for treatment to jesco and approx 158 tons
of lowconcentration pcb waste was contracted to a private incineration facilities certified by the japanese ministry of the
environment we will continue to treat pcb waste towards march 31 2027 which is the legally designated deadline by
which decontamination is to be completed

environmental accounting

overview of environmental impact from business operation
in order to mainly manufacture and market electrical and electronic products panasonic consumes petroleum and
electricity as energy sources and resources as raw materials of parts and components as a result we emit co2 and waste
into the environment this diagram maps the environmental impact from our business operation from a procurement stage
to recycling activities also ghg throughout the entire supply chain is classified into scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 and
assessed according to the ghg protocol the international calculation standard

15 figures for japan
16 the principal factor in the decrease since fiscal 2014 comes from calculation using the latest basic unit defined in the guideline published by the
   japanese ministry of the environment and the ministry of economy trade and industry
17 the principal factor in the decrease since fiscal 2014 comes from the decrease in the number of sites covered in the calculation due to
   operational changes of leased assets resulting from business structural reforms
18 the principal factor in the decrease since fiscal 2014 comes from the change in transport distance between the distribution center the retailer
   and the consumer from panasonic standards to the scenario defined in the guideline on calculating household appliance life cycle co2
   emission by the japan electrical manufacturers association

environment ecoconscious products and factories

initiatives for ecoconscious products green products
panasonic uses a product assessment system that evaluates the environmental impacts of our products and services
starting at the planning and design stages based on our criteria we accredit our products and services that achieved high
environmental performance as green products gps at the same time starting in fiscal 2014 the existing superior gps1
have been enhanced to designate products and services that accelerate the transition to a sustainable society as strategic
gps of these products products that particularly create new consumer trends are certified as super gps

in the gp accreditation criteria we assess the performance of our products in terms of prevention of global warming
effective utilization of resources and management of chemical substances by comparing not only among our own products
but also with competitors products in fiscal 2012 we took steps to further enhance our accreditation criteria by adding
biodiversity and water conservation to existing items this has in turn enabled the creation of a wider range of gps
1 products and services that showed superior environmental performance to products in the same category in the industry

2 life cycle assessment method of quantitatively assessing the environmental impact of products at each life cycle stage



expanding the scope of strategic gps
panasonic has been devoting much of its energies into the creation of no 1 ecoconscious products superior gps until
fiscal 2013 in the course of business reorganizations such as expansion of btob businesses panasonic has decided not
only to pursue environmental performance of consumer products but also to work on further expansion of products and
services that lead to the mitigation of environmental impact starting in fiscal 2014 the concept of strategic gps has been
introduced for the creation of such products and services in addition to alleviating impact on the global environment with
toplevel environmental performance we aim to accelerate the drive to shift to a sustainable society through a variety of
business operations including those that are expected to reduce impacts through wider dissemination and those directly
cutting impact in specified regions

the ratio of strategic gps rose from approx 173 in fiscal 2014 to 19 in fiscal 2015 we will work to further push up this
ratio in the future
3 although the sustainability report 2014 published in july 2014 indicated the ratio for strategic gps in fiscal 2014 as 22 closer scrutiny showed
  the result to be 17

of the strategic gps the following three were named super gps for fiscal 2015namely tankless toilet new a la uno for
its environmental performance ranking at the top class in the industry solar module hit that can cut down environmental
impact dramatically and vrla battery pack system for forklift truck application which are ev leadacid batteries that
support addressing regional environmental impact

                                                                        27

in addition to topclass energysaving performance in the industry4
the new a la uno introduced a new shape that not only prevents
scattering but facilitates cleaning even when it becomes dirty thus
cutting down the quantity of cleaner and water used hit utilizes
its large power output in promoting the wider use of photovoltaic
power generation in the housing market that demands outstanding
power generation efficiency the vrla battery pack system for
                                                                                                        ev leadacid batteries

initiatives for ecoconscious factories green factories
panasonic is working on green factories gf activities in its efforts to cut down environmental impact caused by
manufacturing specifically based on legal compliance each factory develops a variety of plans for reducing environmental
impact in production activities focusing on co2 emissions total waste generation water consumption and chemical
substance releases and transfers progress control is implemented and improved through total emissions reduction and
specific unit management to achieve both environmental impact reduction and business management

the gf assessment system was introduced in fiscal 2011 aiming for further advancement by visualizing the activity levels
at factories under the system the factories evaluate themselves on a onetofive scale across 19 environmental activity
items classified into six basic groups emissions reduction environmental performance enhancement reduction activities
risk reduction human resource development and management comparing the progress with other sites and implementing
relative assessment enables the factory to identify issues and voluntarily reviewpromote measures for improvement in
fiscal 2014 the system was upgraded to enable the addition of further assessment items to the existing 19 based on the
companys needs

for regular checks on the progress state of subordinate factories and to lead to greater improvements companies share
the best practices implemented at similar factories as well as management knowhow corporatewide to upgrade the
efforts to higher levels through continuous improvement the case studies on reduction implemented at each factory are
registered in the beforeafter ba chart search system and updated for application at other factories presently more
than 2500 cases are registered

additionally information exchanges among factories within each country human resource development and gf promotion
activities on regional issues such as in asia and europe are underway through the manufacturing environmental
information sharing group information on global activities for environmental impact reduction legislation and social
trends are shared and discussions are held to resolve issues in gf promotion outside japan information exchanges are
promoted within each country and region where panasonic factories are located such as in europe southeast asia and
china especially in southeast asia where there are many panasonic plants and diverse legislative frameworks and issues
that vary by country competitions in best practices for environmental impact reduction presentation of awards for best
practices and activities for horizontal promotion covering all factories in the region are held to boost and accelerate action
in this direction

furthermore in order to support these gf activities respective regional headquarters companies and related divisions
in each region are working on various human resource development programs every year in their respective regions
training programs are being organized including those on energy conservation management of chemical substances and
waste management which are in great demand in china and southeast asia where panasonic has many sites special
training programs on environmental laws and regulations are being held especially in china to ensure compliance with the
legislation being strengthened at great speed

environment co2 reduction

size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions
one of the longterm environmental targets set by the international community is to reduce emissions of co2 and other
ghgs by 50 from the 2005 level by the year 2050 to achieve this co2 emissions should peak out reach a peak
and decline thereafter during the period from 2020 to 2030 with this background companies are asked to contribute to
reducing co2 more than ever

panasonic has introduced a unique indicator size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions to accelerate emissions
reduction targeting both our products for energy saving and energy creation and production activities the size of
contribution in reducing co2 emissions is defined as the amount achieved by deducting the actual emissions from the
amount that would have been emitted without the improvements by the energysaving performance of our products and
productivity from fiscal 2006 and this amount is combined with the emission reduction resulting from power generation
by energycreating products in other words it reflects the continuous efforts being made to reduce co2 emissions
panasonic will continue to maximize the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions


we will improve the energysaving performance of our products to reduce the energy consumed in using the products
the more energysaving products are introduced and promoted the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions will
further increase

meanwhile since fiscal 2014 panasonic has been reinforcing its housing automotive and btob solution businesses
and is disclosing the co2 reduction effect results in these areas from fiscal 2015 specifically the data represents air
conditioning load reduction effects from improved insulation performance in panasonic housing energysaving effects
from products by other companies equipped with panasonic energysaving compressors and motors and improved fuel
economy effects from electric vehicles equipped with panasonic automotive batteries as with the calculation of energy
saving effects of our home appliances the trial calculation of the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions through
these effects is based on comparison with the performances of fiscal 2006 we regard the effects as indirect contribution
to reducing co2 emissions to distinguish them from the direct contribution from products under the panasonic brand such
as home appliances


by using electricity generated by solar power generation and such we can reduce co2 emissions from thermal power
plants panasonic will further foster its energy creation business to increase the size of contribution in reducing co2
emissions

contribution in reducing co2 emissions through production activities
panasonic is working to reduce co2 emissions in factories with the aim of contributing to climate change mitigation as
well as improving production efficiency in factories and reducing energy costs

in fiscal 2008 we set a companywide business goal to reduce co2 emissions by 03 million tons in fiscal 2010 compared
to fiscal 2007 as a result of our unified efforts we achieved 084 million tons in co2 emissions reduction surpassing our
target figure since fiscal 2011 we have been using our unique indicator the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions
see pages 3032 to further improve our energy management capabilities and reduce the co2 emissions per basic unit
aiming towards maximizing the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions in production activities in addition to
individual efforts implemented in each factory energysaving and co2 emission reduction measures including horizontal
introduction of good examples across the company specialist training and co2 itakona initiatives1 are promoted
the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions in production activities achieved in fiscal 2015 was 315 million tons
compared with the fiscal 2006 level furthermore we are also reducing energy consumption our investment in co2
emissions reduction in fiscal 2015 was 33 billion yen2

we also take part in the keidanrens commitment to a low carbon society a voluntary action plan for global warming
prevention targeted at 2020 in japan specifically we are steadily implementing energysaving measures in factories and
offices in order to achieve the goals set by the electrical and electronics industry in japan aiming improvement in energy
consumption rate in factories and large offices at an annual rate of 1 on average towards 2020
1 itakona is a term unique to panasonic which refers to a process by which we review stages prior to production to study raw materials to
  ensure waste is minimized and quality is maintained we apply a similar review process for our co2 emissions reduction efforts and call these our
  co2 itakona initiatives the activity is aimed at discovering energy conservation measures from a new viewpoint through continuous display of
  energy consumption levels energy consumption per basic unit and analyzing the factors that influence the variables in each basic unit

3 calculated with the weighted average of the improvement rate for co2 emissions per basic unit of nominal production for each factory the
  amount of co2 emitted from each factory was used for weighting cases that had no improvements basic unit of fiscal 2006 was converted into
  an index as 100
4 increase in co2 emissions per basic unit in fiscal 2012 2013 and 2014 is due to the decline in production volume
5 the factors related to fuels are based on the guidelines for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions version 22 published by the japanese
  ministry of the environment the co2 emission factor kgco2kwh for electricity purchased in japan in each fiscal year is fixed at 0410 to
  accurately reflect efforts for co2 emissions reduction if the factors set for each fiscal year are used instead 0425 for fiscal 2006 0476 for fiscal
  2012 and 0487 for fiscal 2013 057 for fiscal 2014 and 2015 total co2 emissions will be 463 million tons for fiscal 2006 381 million tons for
  fiscal 2012 335 million tons for fiscal 2013 318 million tons for fiscal 2014 and 280 million tons for fiscal 2015 the factors above are also
  used for electricity purchased from power producers and suppliers pps the ghg protocol factors for each country are used for electricity
  purchased outside japan

reduction effects to date we have introduced more
than 40000 measurement systems and factory
energy management systems fems at all of our
global manufacturing sites and we have continued to
promote our co2 metageji 6 initiative

based on this scheme the co2 itakona initiative                                minimum energy consumption per basic unit
has been implemented since fiscal 2011 the
activity is aimed at discovering energy conservation                                                                  time
measures from a new viewpoint through continuous
display of energy consumption per basic unit of production and analyzing the factors that influence the variables in each
basic unit

in order to accelerate action under the co2 itakona initiative we developed the senavi software that displays energy
and production data simultaneously and analyze energy consumption per basic unit the energysaving navigation
function of this software quantitatively extracts energy loss per device as well as loss per factor based on the automatic
energy loss analysis results through co2 itakona analysis with this function energysaving efforts prioritizing processes
with large energy loss have been made easier 

conventionally energy consumption and other data had been analyzed manually by specialists in order to develop energy
conservation measures this function automatically analyzes data and enables users to consider energy conservation
measures based on the energysaving measure database not only did this contribute to a reduction in working time but
also to the identification of energysaving measures without the assistance of specialists
 an example of factory energy conservation support service is introduced in the following website
httpwwwpanasoniccomglobalcorporatesustainabilityecoco2servicehtml


in our semiconductor plant in suzhu china minimum measurement instruments were installed in processesfacilities
subject to energy saving and based on that data local employees conducted analyses on loss per production volume
per basic unit using the senavi energysaving navigation function as a result of efficiently working on energysaving
measures an energy saving of approx 18 was achieved in the cold water pumping facility within about a month
after introduction going forward the factory will utilize the devicefactorspecific energy loss identification function in
compressors and production facilities in order to increase the efficiency and effects of energysaving activities
6 metageji is a term unique to panasonic which refers to visualizing energy consumption and implementing measurable reduction initiatives by
  introducing measurement instruments such as meters and gauges

reducing co2 emissions in logistics
to contribute to the prevention of global warming as well as to improve transportation efficiency while reducing costs
panasonic is working to reduce co2 emissions in logistics we have set the targets of reducing co2 emissions per basic
unit1 by at least 1 yearonyear and by 46 from the fiscal 2006 level by fiscal 2019 focusing on modal shift introduction
of lowemission vehicles and biodiesel fuel reduction in transportation distances and improvement in load factor

in fiscal 2015 our global co2 emissions from logistics activities came to 081 million tons across the world of which
international transportation was 037 million tons 46 and domestic transportation within japan was 0135 million
tons 17 although co2 emissions per basic unit increased by 8 from the previous fiscal year due to the increase in
international air freight this is still a reduction of 36 from the fiscal 2006 level
1 co2 emissions per transportation weight the scope covers both international and domestic transportations

modal shift 2 initiative in collaboration with logistics partners
panasonic promotes modal shift in transportation from trucks to railroad in order to reduce co2 emissions

in fiscal 2015 panasonic took the initiative in modal shift collaborating with our logistics partners including japan freight
railway company nippon express co ltd and kintetsu panasonic trading service co ltd

one of such initiatives is the transportation of security cameras from suzhou in china to urayasu city in chiba prefecture
japan the conventional transportation method was via air freight directly from suzhou to haneda airport in tokyo or
narita airport in chiba prefecture this was changed to a method where the products were transported to hakata port in
fukuoka prefecture by ship and then to a freight center near urayasu city via railroad although there was an issue that
transportation took longer than before it was overcome by using highspeed freight vessels co2 reduction effects from
this initiative reach 61 tons per year

we also realized another modal shift in the transport of pos systems from shanghai china to tosu city saga prefecture
japan pos systems were conventionally transported via air freight from shanghai to fukuoka airport in fukuoka
prefecture and then carried by truck for approx 40 km from fukuoka to tosu this was changed to highspeed vessel
transportation form shanghai to hakata port in fukuoka prefecture then to the tosu freight terminal by railroad changing
the transportation method from truck to railroad would generally cost more if the distance is less than 500 km however we
made this change possible by a variety of arrangements such as by using smaller containers and utilizing the temporary
storage service offered by the railroad transport the co2 emission reduction effect is equivalent to 74 tons per year

as a result of such efforts our railroad freight transportation within japan in fiscal 2015 became equivalent to 14191 five
ton containers which resulted in a reduction of 7013 tons of co2 emissions
2 switch from truck and air transport to railroad and sea vessel transport that has less environmental impact

environment resources recycling

recyclingoriented manufacturing
with swift economic growth advancing worldwide and bringing heightened attention to concerns over resources the
sourcing of new resources and materials not only significantly impact the environment but mineral resource depletion and
material pricing runup have also become issues

to address these concerns and as a responsibility of a manufacturer that uses a large volume of resources panasonic
has been propelling recyclingoriented manufacturing under the theme of recycling resources since 2010 placing it as an
important issue along with co2 emissions reduction

recyclingoriented manufacturing has three aspects under this concept which are to minimize the amount of total
resources used and maximize the amount of recycled resources aim towards zero waste emissions by reducing our final
disposal of waste from production activities and recycle used products

we have been working on the weight reduction and downsizing of products to minimize the total resources used and are
continuing to increase resource collection through introduction of new recycling technologies and systems to expand the
usage of recycled resources

furthermore by reducing the amount of factory waste and thoroughly recycling resources from waste we are working to
eliminate the amount of waste treated in landfills to as close to zero

in addition to utilizing the resources that were previously wasted across the entire production process we have established
a process where resources are recovered from used products recycled into products and further delivered to customers
to realize sustainable business activities throughout the product life cycle

we use many kinds of resources including iron 27 of total resources used and plastic 10 of total resources used
due to our wide range of products and businesses from home appliances components such as semiconductors and
batteries to housing in recyclingoriented manufacturing it is important to promote the reduction of total resources used
and at the same time develop a recycling process according to the specific characteristics of each resource for expansion
of our usage of recycled resources

furthermore we clarify recycled resource utilization issues by identifying the volume of each type of resource used across
the panasonic group for example in the case of recycled plastic we used approx 16000 tons of recycled plastic in our
products in fiscal 2015 by identifying the characteristics required in the materials used securing a stable supply researching
how to recycle it in production and developing new recycling technologies by promoting the use of recycled resources in
products a number of different products that incorporate recycled resources have been launched since fiscal 2014

the total volume of recycled resources used decreased due to a less lumber use deriving from a drop in demand for
construction materials and other factors as a result the recycled resource utilization ratio1 became 163 we will
continue to work on further reducing total resources used and maximizing utilization of recycled resources to maintain and
improve our recycled resource utilization ratio

in addition as for the recycling rate of waste at factories we had traditionally set different targets for japan and countries
outside japan according to the relevant local infrastructures however with the awareness of the importance of zero
waste emission activities we have set a globally standardized target since fiscal 2011 and are taking steps to improve the
standard level of waste recycling across the entire group the factory waste recycling rate2 was 988 for fiscal 2015
against the target of 995 or more in fiscal 2019 see page 52

environment reduction in resources used

reducing product mass
to minimize the use of resources for production we continuously look to reduce the weight of our products

through the product environmental assessment see page 27 panasonic has been promoting resource saving from the
product planning and design stage such as using less resources making our products lighter and smaller and using less
components we also implement various measures from the standpoint of resource recycling throughout the product life
cycle such as component reuse longer durability use of recycled resources easier battery removal and labels necessary
for collectionrecycling

examples of weight reduction and recyclable product design are also introduced in the following website

environment product recycling

global initiatives for used product recycling
aiming toward the effective use of natural resources and the prevention of environmental pollution a growing number of
recycling laws have been enacted in various countries throughout the world examples include the law for recycling of
specified kinds of home appliances home appliance recycling law and the act on the promotion of effective utilization
of resources in japan the weee directive in the european union and recycling laws in many states in the united
states in china as well a similar law has been taking effect since 2011 in addition to complying with relative laws in
respective countries we strive to establish the most efficient recycling system in each country in view of its local recycling
infrastructure


fy2015 results
   japan         recycled approx 120000 tons of four kinds of home appliances

   europe        collected approx 34000 tons of used electronic products

    usa          collected approx 16000 tons of used electronic products



product recycling initiatives in japan
in response to the home appliance recycling law of 2001 which covers four specified kinds of home appliances we
established ecology net co ltd jointly with toshiba corporation which manages a geographically dispersed recycling
network through the effective use of existing recycling facilities nationwide the recycling management company operates
all the recyclingrelated services which includes supervising 360 designated collection sites shared with groups a and
b and 32 recycling facilities on behalf of the group a manufacturers 19 companies including panasonic our recycling
factories panasonic eco technology center co ltd petec panasonic eco technology kanto co ltd peteck and
chubu eco technology co ltd cetec1 conduct unique research to improve our recycling processes for more efficient
treatment of the four kinds of home appliances2 and for the recovery and supply of more resources in fiscal 2015 we
recycled approx 120000 tons of the four specified home appliances

amendment of the home appliance recycling law was considered in 2014 in order
to make recycling charges clearer and lower as well as to improve recycling rates3
as a result the statutory recycling rate4 was revised in april 2015 each of our
recycling factories implemented measures to further enhance resource recycling
aiming to improve the recycling rate of the entire group a

at petec while the resin selection equipment with nearinfrared spectroscopy
installed in 2012 originally identified only one type of resin at a time a newlyadopted
technology has enabled simultaneous identification of three types of resin thereby                   new refrigerator disassembly line in peteck
significantly increasing the volume of recyclable resources see pages 4950 this
new equipment and technology have also been installed in peteck and are planned
to be introduced in other recycling factories

additionally in the recycling of refrigerators at peteck a refrigeratorprocessing line
incorporating new technologies has been installed which include a pos peteck
omnipotent server system that controls the in and out of refrigerators corresponding
to two types of insulating fluorocarbons a laser cutter for refrigerator bodies and
a vacuum insulation material remover that uses induction heat to reutilize vacuum

recycling efforts in the europe  cis region
since its establishment we have been closely involved in the operations of the recycling electrical products industry
consortium repic a compliance scheme for electrical appliance recycling in the uk it was more than 10 years ago that
the uk originally started discussing legislation concerning waste electrical and electronic equipment weee we examined
how to establish a recycling system and other related issues and eventually established a nonprofit compliance scheme
known as repic in collaboration with other corporations repic manages almost a half of the total weight of weee in the
uk which is processed in the uk weee system

over the years we have contributed to the revised weee regulations put into effect in 2014 through working with repic
the uk government and other stakeholders the uk weee regulations previously
allowed trading of evidence notes which is proof of treated weee between
schemes however the limited visibility of such trading became an issue and
the revised 2014 regulations resulted in evidence trading being abolished the
change enabled schemes to have a full audit trail of which treatment company
was being used so helping to improve treatment quality and reduce unnecessary
costs we will continue to contribute to the sustainable operation of the electrical
appliance recycling system in the uk through an industry association

in 2014 we collected approx 34000 tons5 of used products covered by the                          panasonic employee presenting accomplishments
                                                                                                     of law amendment at a uk parliamentary event
weee directive across europe


russia is currently discussing weee legislation and panasonic is working on developing appropriate regulations through
an industry association ratek the russian government is planning to collect the recycling fee of the products subject to
weee regulations uniformly from manufacturers in a form similar to a tax as actions against this plan ratek is working
towards building efficient recycling schemes under the initiative of manufacturers
5 calculated by multiplying the weight of collected products per collection system by panasonic market share in terms of weight per collection
  system


promoting recycling activities in north america
panasonic is taking a leading role in establishing and operating a recycling system for
waste batteries and consumer electronic products in north america following the start
up of a state recycling law in minnesota in july 2007 we established the electronic
manufacturers recycling management company llc mrm jointly with toshiba
corporation and sharp corporation in september of the same year and began recycling
tvs pcs and other electronic equipment with collaborative ties to four recycling
companies each with a nationwide network we are running a recycling program that
covers the entire united states through more than 1600 collection bases panasonic
collected approx 16000 tons of used electronic products according to each state
mandate and by our voluntary efforts in 2014

panasonic is actively involved in a range of recycling activities for example in june 2014
we joined sustainable electronics recycling international seri a nonprofit organization    gold tier award received in the
aimed at environmentoriented electronics recycling as a founding member in the             sustainable management electronics
                                                                                              challenge
following month we received the gold tier award for our participation in the sustainable
material management challenge a campaign to promote appropriate recycling organized
by the us environmental protection agency under the smm challenge we committed to using only thirdparty certified
electronic product recyclers in our ewaste recycling programs in the us

as for waste batteries we established call2recycle in 1994 jointly with other leading battery manufacturers and now
provide recycling programs for rechargeable batteries throughout the us and canada




                                                                        46

out of ten provinces and three territories in canada nine currently have weee regulations however the programs run by
local management organizations in each province and territory differ from each other panasonic is a member of all of these
local organizations contributing to effective recycling activities there are now more than 1700 permanent collection sites
in canada and we are currently working to standardize the operation of these programs on a national basis

weee legislation is currently under discussion in the yukon northwest and nunavut territories in northern canada in
those areas we are also presenting our ideas for manufacturerled producer responsibility programs for treatment of
used consumer electronic products


recycling business in china
the regulation for the management of recycling and disposal of waste electrical
and electronic products was enforced in january 2011 under this regulation
we established a joint recycling company in hangzhou named panasonic dadi
dowa summit recycling hangzhou co ltd pdsh with chinese and japanese
companies and its operation started in february 2014 this new company
aims at becoming an advanced model for home appliance recycling in china in
accordance with the above regulations utilizing the methods of advanced and
practical technology and a contemporary control system that have developed
through our recycling business in japan for more than a decade the company          new tv disassembly line in pdsh

engages in collecting and disassembling used appliances as well as selling
resources from used appliances through these businesses the company will
contribute to environmental conservation and the effective use of resources in the
country


international collaboration in southeast asia and oceania
we commenced phase ii of the heartland ewaste recycling programme in january 2015 this voluntary waste reclaiming
activity in singapore is an initiative to provide a recycling platform of home appliances and electronic waste based on a
shared responsibility concept among manufacturers recyclers retailers local communities and the government the
program aims to raise recycling awareness among the community by offering an integrated platform for recycling waste
home appliances through diverse channels during phase i from july 2013 to february 2014 approx 1800 home
appliances exceeding 10 tons in total weight were collected in two neighborhoods in southeast singapore the scope of
phase ii which runs for nine months from february 2015 has been expanded to cover seven neighborhoods in addition
a survey on residents awareness of ewaste recycling will also be conducted by students and volunteers at the collection
points such insights will assist in mapping out singapores ewaste landscape

regulators in vietnam malaysia and thailand are gearing towards the global trend of mandating responsible endof
life product recycling discussions with regulators and industry bodies are in progress such examples include malaysia
department of environmentjapan international cooperation agency jica ewaste management system feasibility study
joint initiative between japanese and vietnamese governments and thailand local industry association continuous
discussions with the australian government to support the review of the existing ewaste recycling regulation are also in
progress through such engagements between the government and industry bodies panasonic hopes to contribute to the
formulation of sustainable ewaste management policy in each country


recycling efforts in india
in india the recycling law was enforced in may 2012 requiring manufacturers to form their own recycling systems in
response to this enforcement we established the i recycle program that collects and treats waste home appliances
panasonic has also been taking part in the consumer electronics and appliances manufacturers association ceama to
help develop the white paper to reports on an analysis of current recycling activities in india and a medium to longterm
plan for waste problem solutions the white paper was submitted to the ministry of environment forests and climate
change in january 2015

the market penetration of home appliances is expected to continue to grow at a fast pace in india we will hold further
negotiations with the indian government through various industry associations to help establish an even more efficient and
robust recycling system

recycling initiatives in latin america
as the trend of reinforcing environmental laws progresses in latin american countries discussions on legislating recycling
laws and actual enforcement are being conducted

we are having dialogues with the brazilian government jointly with an industry association and retailers about the
establishment of local recycling systems we are also actively engaged in a resource collection campaign in major cities
our efforts also include participation in the improvement program of reverse logistics systems in brazil through an industry
association to reinforce the system and making it more effective the project is planned to run for three years with technical
support from jica following a request by the brazilian government

in colombia we also formed a recycling management organization under an alliance of manufacturers liaising with
governmental organizations and industrial groups the first step was collection of refrigerators aiming at mitigating
ozone depletion in mexico and peru we conducted ewaste collection campaigns while working towards enforcement
of optimum recycling regulations for each country we are also actively discussing with governments in costa rica and
argentina about the best recycling legislation while also working on planning practical recycling systems

petec is capable of sorting three major types of resins with different purposes and propertiespolypropylene pp
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs and polystyrene psfrom shredder residue of waste home appliances with an
accuracy of at least 99 this precision separation is realized by our original nearinfrared identification technology
conventionally shredder residues were generally discarded or used as fuel however this technology has enabled the
sorting and recovering of single resins

pp abs and ps were conventionally sorted by each type at a time over three processes but in fiscal 2015 we developed
new technologies to sort these three types of resin simultaneously the first of the new technologies is airflow control
technology which is used to blow resin pieces of different shapes and sizes after their types have been identified the
technology reduces the impact of aerodynamic drag caused when blowing the pieces into the air from the conveyer and
stabilizes the trajectory of the resin pieces the second is the air discharge technology to instantaneously optimize the
duration of the air jet and nozzle position to shoot down the flying resin pieces the third is highspeed signal processing
technology to instantaneously detect the type of resin of the flying piece that is moving at 3 msecond and ensures
continuously shooting the piece down using more than 700 air nozzles

these three technologies have significantly improved the resin sorting efficiency
through development and introduction of such technologies we are striving to
improve recycling treatment efficiency and to enhance the scope of resource
recycling the technology also detects and removes specific hazardous substances
during sorting which keeps the substance content significantly lower than regulated
by stringent european legislation moreover because no water is necessary for this
sorting process and there is no need for effluent treatment it contributes to reducing
environmental impact caused by wastewater after the recycling process                                          nearinfrared sorting machine that can sort

the recycled single resins sorted and recovered at petec are then transferred to the adjacent kato plastic recycling
factory to be washed and processed to recover their chemical properties kato plastic recycling factory is a
manufacturing and development site that demonstrates promotion of use of recycled resin at our appliances company
a home appliance manufacturer and seller the factory plays an important role in enhancing recycled resin utilization by
developing recycling technologies such as a more efficient method for cleaning recycled resins recycled resin is generally
weaker in strength and has a shorter life than new resin this is why its chemical properties have to be recovered to the
level of new resin to make them usable as materials and components in new products different properties are required
for different resins we have established techniques that make full use of the properties optimal to each resin such as pp
abs and ps which include adding antioxidants or mixing recycled and new resins

recycled resin processed and qualityassured by petec and kato plastic recycling factory are reborn in our
manufacturing factories as filter frames for air conditioners or internal parts in ih cooking heaters and refrigerators
according to the resin type to serve the right functions in the right places


building a recycling scheme for scrap iron
jointly with tokyo steel co ltd we started a recycling scheme for scrap iron in july 2013 in this scheme we recover the
scrap iron from used home appliances and tokyo steel makes it into steel sheets we then purchase the sheets back as
a material for our products supplying scrap iron for recycling and repurchasing the recycled iron is the first scheme of its
kind in the japanese electrical manufacturing industry

specifically scrap iron from home appliances collected and treated at petec is supplied to tokyo steels okayama plant
where the scrap iron is processed into electric steel plates1 panasonic procures the recycled steel plates and utilizes
them in products discussions with tokyo steel commenced in 2010 and we have worked together since then to improve
the quality of recycled iron to a level sufficient for production use as well as developing the technology to improve the
applicability of the recycled iron from this we identified the optimum application of the electric steel plates and refined
its specific features eg shape strength and weldability to meet applicationspecific requirements use of thin electric
steel plates in our products was first made possible in 2011 through this close collaboration we materialized this recycling
scheme in 2013 a scheme where a home appliance recycling company that we own supplies scrap iron to be used to
make electric steel plates

                                                                        50

the amount of scrap iron we initially supplied to tokyo steel was about 50 tons per month in fiscal 2015 it reached over
2100 tons and the recycled steel is being used in our products including washing machines and ceiling materials for
housing

the increase in electric steel plate usage leads to an increase in the usage of scrap iron which is one of the most important
resources in japan in addition producing steel plates from scrap iron emits much less co2 compared with producing
steel plates from scratch this scheme also stabilizes the procurement price because the price of scrap iron supplied from
petec and the price of electric steel plates procured from tokyo steel are determined by the scrap iron fluctuation rate
agreed between the two companies we will further expand this recycling scheme for more efficient resource utilization

environment factory waste management  zero waste emissions

improving factory waste recycling rate
from the viewpoint of effective usage of resources we believe that generation of waste and revenuegenerating waste at
factories must be minimized even if such waste could be sold as valuable commodities based on this belief we identify
the amount of generated waste including both revenuegenerating waste and factory generated waste and classify
it into 1 recyclable waste including those that can be sold and those which can be transferred free of charge or by
paying a fee 2 waste that can be reduced by incineration or dehydration and 3 landfill waste with no option other
than being sent to landfills

we reduce the emission of waste by boosting yield in our production process and increasing the recycling rate of our
waste materials accordingly we strive globally toward achieving our zero waste emissions from factories 1 goal by
reducing the amount of landfill to nearly zero

we have reinforced our efforts in china and other asian regions as well as in europe the recycling scheme in a new
factory that caused the overall recycling rate to fall in fiscal 2014 entered into full operation in february 2015 this
resulted in the fiscal 2015 recycling rate reaching 988 an increase of 01 point over the previous fiscal year we will
continue our initiatives to achieve the factory waste recycling rate target of 995 by fiscal 2019

as a means to reduce the generation of waste we are fostering resourcesaving product design in our production
activities we are engaging in resource loss reduction employing our own unique material flow analysis methods we
consider materials that do not become products and excessive use of consumables as resource losses and make the
material flow and lost values for each process visible in order to resolve the issues with the involvement of the design
manufacturing and other relevant business divisions in the future we will promote further reductions in resource losses
through the resource loss navigation our original system developed to automatically display information to help reduce
resource losses

as measures to reduce the amount of landfill of waste and revenuegenerating waste we constrain the amount of waste
materials that are particularly difficult to recycle such as thermosetting resin we are also strictly adhering to waste
sorting practices in production processes to further expand the reuse of resources

because waste recycling rates in our overseas factories lag behind those in japan we have worked to improve the
average level of recycling activities by sharing information within and between regions outside japan specifically
in addition to accelerating the information sharing on waste recycling issues between our local factories and group
companies in japan we also promote the sharing of excellent examples and knowhow among our factories across
regions by utilizing ba charts2 prepared by each region following our longstanding approach toward co2 reduction

environment water resource conservation

approaches to water resource conservation
it is said that available fresh water is only about 001 of the earths total water resources according to the global risk
report published by the world economic forum in january 2015 the water crisis is listed as the top risk with a global
impact in order to save this limited resource panasonic aims at manufacturing in which water is recycled endlessly in the
manufacturing processes of parts materials and products we also provide customers with products that help save water
and are working on the conservation of water resources throughout our business activities

in order to identify and mitigate the impact of water risk on business activities we also started assessing the scope of
impact of water risks at all our factories across the world utilizing a global water risk mapping tool aqueduct created by
the world resources institute wri because the levels of water risk vary according to region we will place our focus on
water conservation initiatives in regions where the risk is particularly high

in addition panasonic participates in the water project which was established under the initiative of the ministry of the
environment in japan in 2014 and is a joint promotion project between the government and the private sector to maintain
sound water recycling and encourage water environment recovery we are working together with the japanese government
and other companies to preserve our valuable water resources



water resource conservation through products
by thoroughly analyzing the use of water through our products we have developed functionalities that allow a considerable
amount of water conservation by utilizing water at a maximum level through improvement of water flow control and cyclic
use in fiscal 2012 we enhanced one of the criteria water conservation in our green product accreditation criteria see
pages 2628 and are speeding up the development of industryleading products that contribute to water saving

company which manufactures solar panels set the fiscal 2015 target to
reduce water usage while increasing production volume in fiscal 2015 the
factory reused the wastewater discharged when creating pure water by
filtering the impurities in the wastewater using another water purifier through
such efforts the water usage in the factory has been reduced by 04 and
water usage per basic unit improved by 236 compared to the previous
year we will continue to promote water usage reduction activities with
targets while increasing production volume in fiscal 2016                                      eco solutions company nishikinohama factory

environment chemical substance management

initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of chemical substances
as represented by the enforcement of the reach regulation1 in the european union the world is moving toward the goals
agreed at the world summit on sustainable development wssd held in 2002 which is to produce and use all chemical
substances in a manner that minimizes their impact on human health and the environment by 2020 in support of the
precautionary approach proposed in the rio declaration made at the earth summit in 1992 we have been manufacturing
products in line with our basic policy of reducing the use of chemical substances that might adversely affect human health
and the environment throughout their lifecycles as specific initiatives we aim to reduce the environmental impact of our
products by 1 identifying hazardous substances contained in our products 2 evaluating these substances on their
environmental impact and 3 voluntarily reducing or discontinuing their use in case of any environmental risks
1 regulations on the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances

process to reduce the environmental impact of chemical substances


                reduce environmental impact

  reduce and discontinue the use and release voluntarily


                assess environmental impact

   thoroughly identify chemical substances contained
                reach compliance measures
                rohs compliance measures

to promote our initiatives clearly we set forth our chemical substances management rank guidelines which prohibit or
specify certain substances for management in terms of our products and factory activities companies in the panasonic
group are requested to follow the guidelines and suppliers are also requested for support as necessary in fiscal 2013
we added level 3 to the chemical substances management rank guidelines for products to review the timing for the
prohibition of further substances that may adversely affect humans and the environment in addition to the current and
forthcoming prohibitions

management of chemical substances in products
to minimize the environmental impact of chemical substances contained in products we endeavor to identify chemical
substances used in the components and materials of our products in addition for substances that are prohibited in
products in major developed countries due to legislation such as the european rohs directive we specify prohibited
substances to globally ensure that they are not used or contained in our products except in certain cases where
substitution of the substances are infeasible moving forward we will conduct environmental impact assessments for
managed substances contained in our products take steps to reduce the use of substances where the impact on human
health and the environment cannot be ignored and create plans to eventually prohibit the use


identifying chemical substances in products
to contribute to the achievement of the global goals set at the wssd it is important for us to disclose and communicate
information on the chemical substances used in our products across the supply chain for which we must promote cross
industrial initiatives to establish and disseminate an effective system we are a member of the joint article management
promotion consortium jamp together with about 440 major companies from various industries such as chemical

                                                                                     57

component and equipment manufacturers we are proactively formulating utilizing and disseminating chemical
substance management standards and systems through this organization since fiscal 2005 we have been using a
chemical substance management system gpweb to gather data concerning the chemical substances contained in the
components and materials for our products from our suppliers in july 2009 we asked our suppliers to submit the data
in a common format by the joint article management promotion consortium jamp and approx 10000 suppliers are
currently using this format


because only the manufacturer of a certain part knows what substances are contained therein it is necessary to request
information not only to our suppliers but also to further upstream suppliers who do not have direct transactions with
panasonic in order to ensure that the communication of this information flows efficiently we have created an online
elearning site regarding chemical substance management in japanese chinese and english in february 2014 we
discontinued the authorization process required to use the elearning site to make the site more conveniently available to a
wider audience including our suppliers and their customers
in addition to deepen the understanding on the handling of chemical substances among our suppliers outside japan we
have conducted practical seminars to provide attendees with a general overview as well as training on the preparation and
submission of data since fiscal 2011 in china southeast asia and europe

furthermore from fiscal 2015 we started posting the schedule of jamp seminars on the gpweb top page to promote
them among our customers these seminars are held across china by sgscstc standards technical service co ltd a
counterpart of jamp in china and are free of charge

 seminars by sgscstc httprstscnsgscomenseminar_enasp

companies that procure electronic components may need to have a full understanding of the substances contained in the
components at the point of selection or usage in order to adhere to the eu rohs directive and reach regulation

particularly as the reach substances of very high concern svhc list is updated every six months those companies
expect their suppliers to provide the latest substance data to demonstrate compliance with the list

also as a company supplying electronic components to other companies we have published a table of rohs and reach
compliance status on our website since november 2012 so that our clients can obtain relevant chemical substance
information from us quickly and efficiently the table covers our rohs directive compliance information and the substances
designated in the reach svhc list for all our major generic electronic components
 table of rohs and reach compliance status httpindustrialpanasoniccomwwdownloadsrohsreachconfirmationreportdownload


assessing the impact of chemical substances
scientifically identifying the impact on human health and the environment of products containing chemical substances is vital
to the development of products with low environmental impact we are engaging in activities designed to assess the levels
to which customers are exposed to substances of very high concern svhc as well as safety at the time of product use

to date we have undertaken assessments on the impact of phthalate ester contained in power supply cables and ceramic
fibers used in some models of professional microwave ovens as part of our efforts to comply with the eu reach regulation
which requires preparing information for the safe use of products containing svhc we have created and disclosed a safety
assessment document for both cases in each case exposure was considered to be nominal with little concern for any
impact on human health

reduction in usage and emissions of chemical substances
fluorocarbons used as a heat insulator and a refrigerant for freezers and air conditioners can damage the ozone layer and
cause global warming we developed the technology to utilize co2 which has much smaller impact than fluorocarbons
as a refrigerant and have been supplying a home boiler using co2 refrigerant since 2001 although the co2 refrigerant
is suitable for heating purposes it was difficult to apply to refrigerators and freezers especially in large professional
equipment due to insufficient cooling efficiency and size problems however with support from the new energy and
industrial technology development organization nedo we developed a refrigeration system using co2 refrigerant and
now supply these fluorocarbonfree freezers and refrigerator display cases to supermarkets and convenience stores in
japan


                                                                  58

further new development of a dedicated co2 refrigeration system has enhanced the product lineup from 272 models to
651 models and we started accepting orders from may 2015

in addition as measures against ozone depletion caused by hcfcs a refrigerant called r410 that does not deplete the
ozone layer was used in compact air conditioners but
this substance has a very high global warming potential
gwp panasonic then developed a model that uses a new
refrigerant r32 which has a lower gwp and introduced it
to the market in 2013 panasonic then developed a model
that uses a new refrigerant r32 which has a lower gwp
and introduced it to the market in 2013 furthermore pt
panasonic manufacturing indonesia which owns our only
factory for manufacturing compact air conditioners in

reducing the use of pvc resin
polyvinyl chloride pvc is a material of concerns to the generation of hazardous substances from inappropriate disposal
as well as the harmful effects of certain additive agents phthalate ester used to render pvc more pliable in light of
the significant potential for inappropriate disposal of the pvc resin used in the internal wiring of productsdue mainly to
difficulties associated with the sorting of this resin from used productswe have switched our new products launched from
april 2011 to nonpvc

management of chemical substances at factories
panasonic is working to minimize environmental impact by identifying the hazardous substances used in our products
assessing the impact of such use and voluntarily discontinuing the use or reducing the release of such substances since
1999 we have been conducting the 3350 reduction activity to materialize reduction by 33 in three years and by 50 in
six years in japan we started promoting cutbacks in the use release and transfer of chemical substances at our factories
in fiscal 2000 against the target in our voluntary action plan a reduction by 50 from the fiscal 1999 level we achieved
a 75 reduction in chemical substance use and a 62 reduction in release and transfer in fiscal 2005 since then we
have been continuing the activity focusing on substances with particularly large amounts of release and transfer setting
a voluntary action target of reduction by 30 compared to the fiscal 2006 level as a result we achieved a 46 reduction
in the amounts of release and transfer of specified key reductiontarget substances across all factories worldwide in fiscal
2011

reflecting international trends in chemical substance management our reduction measures have focused increasingly on
particularly hazardous substances from fiscal 2011 under our chemical substances management rank guidelines for
factories we have focused our management on select chemical substances that are hazardous to human health and the
environment

further we have created a unique indicator the human environment impact4 which is used globally in all our factories
conventionally the chemical substances were managed by quantity such as usage amount or emissionsrelease
however such quantitybased management has a problem that some highly hazardous substances do not become
subject to reduction or management if the usage amount was small and therefore would fall out of the scope of impact
assessments in addition the toxicity criteria varied according to substance types and regional legislation which made
standardized management across the group difficult to address this issue panasonic worked together with experts
from both within and outside the company reclassified chemical substances based on an overall assessment of their
hazardousness and specified a hazardousness factor for each classification this enables us to place higher priority on
those highly hazardous substances that have greater impact such as carcinogenic and ozone depleting substances which
should be reduced first according to the risk level we use this indicator as the human environmental impact to promote
efforts to ensure reduction of highly hazardous substances

in fiscal 2015 we were able to reduce voc emissions by 42 compared to fiscal 2011 by substituting highly hazardous
substances in paints improving yields promoting recycling introducing substances with lowsolvents and hazards and
improving processes including reviewing the amount of paint or the number of washing cycles as well as improving the
efficiency of removaldeodorization equipment we will continue our initiatives to minimize the amount of substances with
environmental impact released through our production activities

environment biodiversity conservation

approach to biodiversity
business management and human life in our society is founded on the ecosystem servicesa multitude of natures
blessings provided by our natural capital including soil air water and animals and plants it is important to preserve
biodiversity to sustain the benefits derived from this natural capital towards the future however this biodiversity is
experiencing significant damage at an unprecedented speed accordingly corporate enterprises are now expected to
address the issues of conservation and sustainable use of resources

we are committed to properly understanding the impact of our business activities on biodiversity and contributing to
conservation to this end we are promoting initiatives in cooperation with local governments environmental conservation
ngos and specialized agencies specifically in 2009 we launched a biodiversity project focusing on the three key areas
of land use procurement and products in order to promote biodiversity conservation as an initiative incorporated into our
businesses in promoting the key areas we formulate a biodiversity action plan bap which is the basic concept of article
6 of the convention on biological diversity and implement measures check the achievement progress and improve the
initiatives


initiatives in land use
green areas in our business sites can potentially contribute to conserving biodiversity in that area in particular hardly
any natural environments where wild animals can live and breed remain in urban areas therefore even small areas of
green in corporate premises can become a precious environment for a variety of living organisms if they retain indigenous
vegetation and a watery environment since such areas are often closed from the outside world and hard for foreign
species to blend in

in terms of biodiversity these green areas take on the roles of reinforcing the ecological network and protecting threatened
wild fauna and flora


preservation of biotopes in collaboration with governments and experts
an ecological network refers to the organic relationship between ecological spaces such as the greenery and waters
where a variety of creatures lives and breeds the greenery in our sites helps expand the overall space where wild animals
including birds butterflies and dragonflies live as they can fly from one green area to another dotted in the area in
addition protecting wild fauna and flora in local areas is an activity in collaboration with governments and with help and
advice of experts to preserve endangered species designated by the ministry of the environment or local government
that are deemed to be disappearing from that area our business sites that promote such activities include the ecological
network at the kusatsu factory of appliances company in kusatsu city shiga prefecture the biotope at eco solutions
company in kadoma city osaka prefecture and tsunagari no hiroba at the panahome headquarters in toyonaka city
osaka prefecture


external certification based on quantitative evaluation
in october 2010 the matsumoto factory of the
automotive  industrial systems company became the
first factory green space in japan to obtain the jhep
certification future prospect type which is based on the
biodiversity quantitative evaluation method developed
by the ecosystem conservation society  japan efforts
such as revising the factory green space management
policy and plans of placing deadwood in forests and                                          current sawgrass field
changing a part of the lawn into sawgrass were certified
as prospective contributions to biodiversity conservation
in terms of creating a suitable environment for local wild      deadwood planted in forests
life this certification not only recognizes our efforts
towards biodiversity conservation objectively but also
gives a significant meaning for further implementation

initiatives in products
together with the ngo birdlife international we have established a thirdparty assessment system to provide customers
with information about product contributions to biodiversity through this system we have assessed products which are
closely linked to biodiversity

we have also enhanced our green product accreditation criteria see pages 2628 by adding biodiversity to the existing
items we define products that contribute to biodiversity conservation as those that use biodiversityconscious materials in
their major components and those that include functions to help biodiversity conservation

in fiscal 2014 panasonic environmental systems  engineering co ltd developed atpsbluesys a ballast water
management system bwms to reduce disturbance from maritime transportation of the marine ecology of local sea
areas ballast water is sea water used to retain the balance of a freight vessel at sea when it is not carrying shipment
because the ship travels across the sea taking sea water from one port and then draining the water into another port the
impact of foreign organisms such as plankton and bacteria on the local ecology environment and resources is becoming
an increasingly serious problem atpsbluesys treats microorganisms in the water with inline electrolysis without using
filters which is the first in japan the system can treat the water to a level lower than the standards by the international
maritime organization imo and successfully acquired the imo g9 basic approval g9ba

partnership with the world wide fund for nature wwf
from july 2007 to march 2015 we promoted the yellow sea ecoregion support project in cooperation with wwf japan
china south korea and japan cooperated as partners and worked on the conservation of the rich natural environment as
well as sustainable management of the natural resources in the yellow sea ocean surrounded by china and the korean
peninsula possessing one of the largest continental shelves in the world

the project was executed at 23 potential priority areas selected by wwf in 2006 during the first 2 years we supported



                                                                   63

the awareness promotion activities led by local communities in china and south korea and assisted in the public invitation
to participate in habitat preservation activities in the next 3 years one location in both countries was chosen as model
areas yalu river estuary coastal wetland liaoning province china and muan tidal flat wetland protected area south
jeolla province south korea to implement conservation activities suitable for the regional characteristics from april 2013
general assessment of past activities and results was conducted and activities
in the model areas were promoted through publicity to appeal similar activities
to the world through local research and conservation activity support we
were able to contribute to the improvement in skills of groups engaged in the
activities in the yellow sea potential priority area and promote exchanging
information furthermore we implemented model conservation activities in
the two areas that contribute to regional development from the standpoint of
environmental education and ecotourism to think about the sustainability of
an area in terms of its natural environment culture and history as tourism and         panasonic korea employees participate in the
                                                                                          muan tidal flat wetland workshop in october

environment collaboration across the supply chain

collaboration with suppliers and transportation partners
as a company backed by a number of suppliers we must consider the environmental impacts of our entire supply chain
and not just of our own operations through our coordination efforts with suppliers and transportation partners who
form an integral part of our business operations we strive to minimize our environmental impact across the entire supply
chain focusing on the reduction of co2 emissions resource recycling chemical substance management and biodiversity
conservation


measures for green procurement
since the publication of the green procurement standards in 1999 we have been promoting the manufacture of eco
conscious products in partnership with our suppliers furthermore in the green procurement standards we set out the
establishment of a group of suppliers who support our environmental policy in supplying products and goods in order
to materialize the targets in supplier collaboration stated in our green plan 2018 in addition to cooperation in reducing
environmental impact in supplier business operations and sharing achievements through collaboration we are asking
our suppliers to seek the cooperation of upstream business partners to expand the scope of activities of reducing
environmental impact throughout the entire supply chain

also based on the green procurement standards we have been conducting the green procurement survey where we
monitor the implementation status of our suppliers regarding our requests to promote environmental impact reduction
activities more effectively with our suppliers in fiscal 2013 we conducted a trial survey targeted at our major global
suppliers we received responses from 415 companies and were able to confirm the level of activity in areas such as
environmental management system development thorough implementation of chemical substance management
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions promotion of resource recycling and biodiversity conservation

from fiscal 2014 we have replaced surveys conducted on a groupwide scale with surveys at a site level as a means of
communication with our suppliers

in response to the enhancement of regulations such as eu rohs directive we have been engaging in continual
environmental quality assurance audits of our suppliers since 2005 to improve the management level throughout the entire
supply chain in fiscal 2015 we assessed the environmental quality assurance systems of some 1800 suppliers and have
supported their efforts to upgrade their management levels
 green procurement standards httpwwwpanasoniccomglobalcorporatemanagementprocurementgreenhtml


estimation of environmental impacts in business activities by suppliers
in order to assess greenhouse gas ghg emissions across the entire supply chain scope 31 we made our original
calculations based on the greenhouse gas protocol the international accounting standard for ghg emissions since fiscal
2012 we have conducted assessment surveys on four occasions with the cooperation of 185 suppliers in the areas of raw
materials electrical and electronic components and processed parts

our ghg emissions in the upstream range were estimated using the ghg emissions per basic unit by resource type
based on the volume of materials purchased and on the inputoutput table published by the japanese government
the estimation results based on fiscal 2014 data is 128 million tons roughly five times the ghg emissions of our own
production activities
1 other indirect emissions excluding scope 1 direct emissions from facilities owned and controlled by panasonic and scope 2 emissions from
  production of energy consumed at facilities owned and controlled by panasonic


sharing achievements through collaboration
since fiscal 2010 we have been implementing the ecovc2 activity with our suppliers this program is a collaboration
between panasonic and our suppliers aimed to both reduce environmental impact and reinforce product capability
 achieve further rationalization for our products and our suppliers in fiscal 2010 the target for reducing environmental
impact was limited to energy saving co2 emission reduction however this was extended in fiscal 2011 to recycling
oriented manufacturing aiming at saving resources and using recycled materials the geographical range of our activities
has also extended initially centered in japan actions accelerated to china and other parts of asia in fiscal 2013 and later


                                                                       65

extended to a global scale in fiscal 2015

ecovc activities are stored in a database for effective use within the panasonic group furthermore exemplary
activities are recognized through awards at the panasonic excellent partners meeting held every autumn these activity
presentations are also shown at the meeting venue to be shared with participating suppliers for use and application in
future activities

in fiscal 2015 1445 cases exceeding the number in the previous year were presented by suppliers and resulted in
greater accomplishments compared to the previous year in terms of energy saving co2 emission reduction resource
saving reduction in resources used and use of recycled materials use of recycled
resources as well as in rationalization of costs outstanding practices were
selected including development of a new magnetic steel sheet for greater motor
efficiency

continuing efforts will be made together with as many suppliers as possible in
realizing reduction of environmental impacts product capability reinforcement
 further rationalization through ecovc activities and further strengthen
partnerships with our suppliers                                                        exhibition of outstanding ecovc practices

fundamental stance on customer satisfaction cs
since its foundation panasonics management philosophy has been to contribute to society through its products and
services while always putting the customer first based on this philosophy the company strives to improve customer
satisfaction and offers products solutions and services that enrich the lives of people around the world

when providing customer service panasonic strives for sincerity accuracy and speed and acts with humility and
appreciation this finds its basis in the principle of true service that the companys founder handed down through his
words the companys fundamental stance is thus to provide customers trust peace of mind and satisfaction


 the fundamental concept of customer satisfaction the pursuit of customer satisfaction

 the only way for those of us engaged in business to earn trust is to have everyone regardless of whether they are
 working in the manufacturing division or the sales division cater completely to the demands of the customers on
 all points and work strictly under the basic rule of producing or selling not even one product that cannot perform its
 function well

 perfection can be reached only by paying careful attention not only to the manufacturing details but also to where our
 products are going and making efforts to completely satisfy the customers and provide flawless service

                                                                                                     konosuke matsushita

                                                                             from matsushita electrics 50year history



 service philosophy true service
 the customers satisfaction is our satisfaction
 true service resides in mutual satisfaction

 service is an integral part of any business a business that does not provide service is no business at all service
 therefore is the duty and obligation of any business person but theres nothing more aggravating than service provided
 only out of a sense of duty customers can sense it

 service means satisfying customers and when we satisfy our customers we in turn find satisfaction in a job well done

 satisfied customers and satisfied employees this is what constitutes true service

                                                                                                     konosuke matsushita

fair operating practices

management system
we are striving to strengthen our internal control prevention detection and response with regard to compliance placing
priority on abiding by antitrust laws and preventing corruption


as corporate activity expands globally improprieties occur with some frequency due not just to deliberate dishonest and
criminal acts but also to a lack of awareness and understanding employees doing business in countries and regions where
legal systems are incompletely realized must perennially exercise a high degree of awareness of norms

we at panasonic have set down a clear set of rules for compliance with the law and corporate ethics we strive to achieve
thorough adherence to these rules with the aim of promoting fair operating practices in all countries and regions of the
world and to realize a sustainable society this is the panasonic code of conduct which incorporates the requirements
of the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development guidelines for multinational enterprises and other
norms

in our observance of our own code of conduct we have a global network of legal departments directors and executive
officers in charge of ensuring adherence to the code of conduct as well as managers in charge of export control and
other persons responsible for supervising various other functions in our companies business divisions and regional
headquarters outside japan

each year we designate september to be compliance awareness month marked by efforts to strengthen our awareness
of the need to observe ethical and legal requirements we conduct a compliance awareness survey to check the degree
of compliance awareness dissemination among our employees around the world once each year we check the status of
observance and practice of the panasonic code of conduct in our business locations around the world

in addition to prevent improprieties and achieve quick resolutions we have established hotlines for whistleblowers in our
domestic and foreign business locations and for our business partners

we strive to resolve at the business location level the issues that are identified through these efforts but these measures
are also collected in a unified comprehensive manner at the group head office level so they are reflected in corporate
wide measures based on social conditions as well currently our priority themes are abiding by antitrust laws and
preventing corruption

group workers union association have stipulated in their labor agreement that unions retain the rights to organize to
collectively bargain and to strike

in addition even in countries and regions where the formation of labor unions is not permitted because of legislation
regulations or conventional labor practices the panasonic code of conduct stipulates the de facto promotion of issue
resolution through labormanagement dialogues which are the goals of the principles of the freedom of association and
the right to collective bargaining in addition the company expressly lists these dialogues as one of the conditions for doing

at business sites where workplace accidents have occurred panasonic investigates the causes behind the incidents
implements measures to prevent reoccurrence and shares accident case studies groupwide so that all business sites
may implement preventive measures so as not to experience the same kinds of accidents themselves

for special tasks such as handling heavy materials or chemical substances the company expends every effort to minimize
the required amount of such work and in accordance with laws and regulations conducts additional health screenings and
continuously monitors the situation to prevent negative health outcomes

concerning work in front of visual display terminals vdts in indirect departments as well the company provides annual
special health screenings for those employees who perform at least four hours of work in front of such displays and for
whom they themselves their bosses or an occupational physician have determined screening to be necessary

responsible supply chain

management system
in todays world people insist that companies respect certain social responsibilities such as respect for human rights and
the environment in their procurement activities supplying outstanding quality and technologies is no longer sufficient
beyond that panasonic strives to ensure that it does business only with suppliers that fulfill their social responsibilities
in five areas clean procurement green procurement compliance with laws and social norms information security and
respect for human rights labor and occupational health and safety

to ensure at employees involved in procurement activities better understand csr procurement and in order to raise their
awareness of csr procurement we have created internal rules and manuals on csr procurement and disseminated the
necessary information via handouts our intranet and training sessions

we include csr terms in our standard purchase agreements with the suppliers who provide our parts and materials those
terms including items relating to human rights items relating to providing a safe workplace and items relating to concern for
the environment these agreements are premised on the understanding that the suppliers agree to abide by panasonics
management philosophy csr procurement guidelines and the for suppliers documents in addition we distribute
information to our suppliers about the csr principles we wish them to observe periodically we evaluate their csr efforts
in addition to evaluating their standards regarding quality cost delivery and services qcds and business execution

with regard to conflict minerals that fund organizations that behave without proper regard for human rights engage in
environmental destruction practice corruption and otherwise act unethically in conflict zones we strive to adhere to the
organisation for economic cooperation and developments oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply
chains of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas

through these efforts together with our suppliers we strive to create sustainable supply chains

responsible supply chain response regarding conflict
minerals

basic stance on conflict minerals
the issues of conflict minerals are considered important by panasonic these minerals are mined in the democratic
republic of congo drc and neighboring countries hereinafter the covered countries and their extraction funds
organizations that violate human rights cause serious harm to the environment perpetrate corruption and are otherwise
involved in illegal activity

to fulfill our social responsibilities in our procurement activities our policy prohibits the usage of illegally obtained conflict
minerals as raw materials

in the rare event that such use is discovered efforts aimed at to terminate any usage must be made without delay

to this end a notice was issued in december 2010 to the entire group requiring a thorough approach to nonuse in
february 2011 efforts began to require checks of our major suppliers sources for procuring minerals

however in the covered countries there are also companies and individuals engaged in legal business activities with
no connection to any illegal activities we also must strive hard to ensure that such companies or individuals business
activities and livelihoods are not harmed by our efforts to avoid using minerals that are illegally obtained

to this end we need to cooperate with a wide range of stakeholders including countries companies and nonprofit
organizations npos that are taking measures to build fair supply chains of minerals in the covered countries based on
these concepts panasonic has been participating in the organisation for economic cooperation and developments oecd
due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas which
began in august 2011

alongside our involvement in this project we are also engaged in other efforts aimed at the implementation of the oecd
guidance building management processes that conform to global standards with the aim of contributing to international
efforts to resolve the problem of conflict minerals

panasonics systems for dealing with conflict minerals
panasonic is making efforts to build companywide systems with ultimate responsibility residing with the executive officer
in charge of manufacturing and procurement with the start of the fourcompany system in april 2013 we designated
a person at each company to be in charge of investigating and reporting on conflict minerals under the aegis of these
individuals each company is making efforts to build systems and carry out investigations based on the characteristics of
its own business


due diligence efforts
we communicate our own policies to our suppliers and we also ask them to make reasonable efforts to become drc
conflictfree and to make their own procurement from conflictfree smelters cfs to the extent possible

investigations of conflict minerals require the cooperation of all suppliers and all the refinerssmelters they work with to
reduce the burden on suppliers and to enhance the efficiency of such investigations we have found it effective to use
common investigating tools and explanatory materials based on this realization panasonic uses as an investigative
tool the conflict minerals reporting template cmrt issued by the conflictfree sourcing initiative cfsi we are also
active participants at investigative briefings held by jeitas japan electronics and information technology industries
association responsible minerals trade working group where we work as a presenter we make active use of manuals
and other handbooks jointly prepared by japanese automobile makers and the japan auto parts industries association for
conducting investigations




                                                                 99

status of investigations
in fiscal 2015 we strengthened our scrutiny of response details to increase the accuracy of our investigative results if we
find a clear contradiction within the details of a response for example if the list of smelters includes a name that is not
a smelter we have been asking the suppliers for reaffirmation of the response details the suppliers response details
have themselves been improving since fiscal 2014 as before however names still appear on the list of smelters that are
companies but not smelters

regarding metals for which we receive the response originated in the covered countries so far we have not identified
any minerals that appear to have been funding armed insurgents but we continue our efforts to verify and identify all the
smelters in the area furthermore through our industry activities we have urged smelters to acquire cfs certification
our suppliers continue to perform due diligence but in the rare event minerals are discovered to have been supportive of
conflict we are asking that these suppliers strive to change their suppliers or take other steps toward nonuse


participation in forums on implementing due diligence for responsible
mineral supply chains
beginning in 2011 panasonic has been participating in oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of
minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas projects currently the forum on responsible mineral supply chains
at the forum in november 2013 we learned about ongoing efforts toward conflictfree minerals procurement including
mines exchanges and traceability systems for responsible minerals procurement in rwanda and ways to identify mines
through analysis of mineral composition and generation we also participated in the forum in paris in may 2015 where we
were able to exchange views with other interested persons and learn about effective approaches to the problem of conflict
minerals


industry cooperation initiatives
investigations of conflict minerals require the cooperation of all suppliers in the supply chain accordingly panasonic
has been working with jeita as cochair and coleader of the responsible minerals trade working group engaging in
educational activities and efforts to make the investigative process more efficient through industry cooperation

more specifically we have been working with industry groups both inside and outside japan and holding seminars and
briefings about investigations to promote correct efforts regarding conflict minerals we have checked information on
smeltersrefiners and helped plan the ipc1755 standards for the sharing of us data on conflict minerals in november
2013 jeitas responsible minerals trade working group teamed up with japanese automakers to create the conflict
free sourcing working group in order to engage in dialog with the smelting industry and to accelerate efforts to verify
information about smeltersrefiners panasonic was also a participant in this activity


support for efforts in democratic republic of congo and neighboring
countries
panasonic has engaged in due diligence initiatives to fulfill its social responsibilities as a downstream company but we
think the most important development towards resolving the problem of conflict minerals would be the establishment of
mechanisms for responsible procurement of minerals in the covered countries

based on this thinking since march 2013 we have been participating with industry groups the us government and
citizen groups in the publicprivate alliance for responsible minerals trade ppa

the ppa supports efforts to create mechanisms and develop capabilities for certification and traceability of minerals
transactions that are unrelated to any conflict in the africas great lakes region at the same time it creates a platform for
dialog and cooperation between participating organizations in the interest of realizing sustainable responsible minerals
trade in the region

panasonic is a participant in ppa and supports efforts aimed at responsible minerals trading aiming to make a contribution
to healthy economic development in the region

support for sustainable development of the covered countries
as panasonics corporate citizenship activity in this region in 2010 we began the panasonic npo support fund for
africa as a means of supporting and strengthening the public relations foundation for nposngos working to resolve
issues in african nations this is our way of supporting organizations working to resolve issues in african nations the list
of organizations we have assisted includes terra renaissance an npo working to resolve issues of land mines small
arms and child soldiers in uganda and the democratic republic of congo and elsewhere 20112013 organizations we
supported in 2014 included the npo reborn kyoto which supports the economic selfreliance of women in rwanda by
providing jobtraining opportunities


dialog with ngos
we are engaged in dialog with ngos regarding handling of conflict minerals in march 2015 we participated in an ethical
mobile phone campaign seminar promoted by the international environmental ngo a seed japan sharing our views on
our handling of conflict minerals with representatives of corporations and ngos we also exchanged views regarding the
importance of sectorcooperative efforts on the handling of conflict minerals going forward we plan to continue this kind
of dialog and cooperation
