2015 was a busy year for alstria with the takeover of deutsche ofﬁce the size of our port
folio has more than doubled creating a number of management and integration challenges
nevertheless this did not stop our effort to lead the way into sustainable real estate we have
continued to make progress in reducing our overall carbon footprint and have extended the
application of our processes to the portfolio of deutsche ofﬁce
in 2013 we decided to change our procurement policy to 100  renewable energy to both
reduce our carbon emissions and stimulate the market for renewable energy in 2015 we
reached our goal with 100  of the electricity procured by alstria being generated from
renewable sources this move gave us the opportunity to improve our procurement process
as a result we have managed to get out of the carbon electricity market and simultaneously
reduce our overall electricity costs
though our goal ﬁrst and foremost is to exit the carbon world as much as possible we
are also looking to improve the energy efﬁciency of our operations thus we have sought




                                                                                                       management letter
iso 50001 certiﬁcation for our energymanagement processes and obtained it over the
course of 2015 we also improved our reporting practices for the ﬁrst time this year we
have sought to receive thirdparty assurance for our nonﬁnancial data this assurance was
obtained for the data included in this report and the certiﬁcate can be found in appendix c
although we have made substantial progress in working to improve the efﬁciency of our
assets there is still a lot to do to reduce the overall carbon footprint of our real estate we are
now in the process of offering our tenants and employees the opportunity to beneﬁt from
our electricity procurement allowing them to beneﬁt from reduced prices while switching
to renewable energies the more our tenants subscribe to this concept the lower the overall
carbon footprint of our portfolio will be in the future
finally we have continued to invest in rd projects either directly through our beehive
coworking project or indirectly through investment in venture capital or grants to university
research we strongly believe that our industry is underinvested in rd and should be doing
more in that ﬁeld we are committed to continuing on our current path as our industry is
going through fundamental changes and its future is being designed as we speak mainly
by players found outside of the industry we need to take this process into our own hands
or risk having to pay a hefty price to catch up later

we hope you enjoy reading this report as much as we enjoyed writing it and look forward
to your feedback

                 riskadjusted returns
                 given the limited opportunities for any quick or shortterm trading of properties which is

                 global sustainability challenges and consistently seize opportunities to develop innovative
                 solutions for our stakeholders

                          re100                         over time procuring renewable electricity is an easy

                  energy having identiﬁed greenhouse gas ghg emissions as one of our main environmental
                  impacts we designed a climate change strategy to substantially reduce our carbon footprint
                  in a short period of time and at a minimal cost thus aligning all our existing activities with
                  our vision for a low carbon future we started buying fossil fuelfree energy in 2013 and
                  we are gradually changing our entire contract to renewable energy with a target to reach
                  100  by the end of 2016 we were the ﬁrst german real estate company to join re100
                  in 2015 and emphasize our commitment to go 100  renewable it is a great way for us
                  to show that alstria is actively changing the way we conduct business and allows us to
                  inﬂuence our peers to follow our example we believe that inﬂuential businesses can serve
                  as a powerful example of how going 100  renewable makes sense socially economically

           the reduction of carbon emissions is more and more becoming the key currency for all
           business operations we see a trend toward the intensiﬁcation of all efforts to minimize
           carbon emissions on the governmental side this postparis trend will further develop as the
           scheme of the climate agreement ﬁnds its way into new domestic and national laws and
           restrictions regarding carbon emissions this new era will bring challenges along with new
           opportunities from which the real estate sector can beneﬁt taking that into account we
           will continue investing in research and innovation and try to keep ourselves and our assets
           in the bestinclass position

progress




           even if we make progress on that ﬁeld data gathering will continue to be one of our great
           est challenges in the future the reason for this is that our tenants consume the major part
           of the energy and are the ones accountable for the majority of the ghg emissions in our
           operations we must therefore rely on their cooperation and engage with them in order
           to achieve signiﬁcant carbon reductions at the beginning of 2017 we are expecting to
           receive all energy consumption data from all the common areas of our buildings this will
           be accomplished by installing smart meters by using such systems we are expecting to fully
           monitor the efﬁciency of our buildings and realize instant reductions on carbon emissions

           we encourage dialogue and support our tenants in all decisions related to our buildings
           efﬁciency as of this year we have successfully disclosed a framework agreement to procure
           renewable energy for our common areas having achieved fair conditions on setting up the
           contract we decided to offer the same beneﬁcial conditions to our tenants and employees
           with us making no proﬁt participation in the framework contract will have an immediate

           individual needs we are planning in 2017 to extend our energy training and additional

                      our business contributes to sustainable development by making our buildings as resource
                      efﬁcient as possible and by developing effective technologies that can automatically adjust
                      to the user behavior we do this by

                      having a budget dedicated to the energy efﬁciency of our buildings
                      our main objective when refurbishing our buildings is the creation of efﬁcient ofﬁce space
                      and reduction of the energy consumption and occupancy costs for our tenants in 2015
                      we invested approximately eur 28 million in refurbishment measures and eur 117 million
                      in development projects

                      investing in costeffective solutions
                      every year we review all of our standing assets in order to determine the needs for preventive
                      capital expenditure and renovations lifecycle costing is the abc of our refurbishment policy
                      for example when choosing the appropriate construction techniques for a new renovation
                      project we avoid using glassfaçade as much as possible this is mainly because of its high
                      thermal conductivity which results in highrunning costs over time we also favor natural
                      ventilation and try to limit the use of cooling systems in our assets to the maximum extent
                      possible

                      investing in research and development
                      we support fundamental research as we try to identify the future trends that we should incor
                      porate in our analysis of our real estate portfolio starting last year we continued supporting

                      california santa barbara as well as his work on organic photovoltaics we believe that such
                      collaborations are mutually beneﬁcial since they allow us to provide researchers with early

feedback on whether we can see a direct application of their research to our business and
they allow us to identify potential gamechanging technologies early on at the same time
this year we also supported research concerning real estate by providing the university of
hamburg with relevant data for more information please see pages 50 to 51

engaging with our employees and tenants
we help our tenants to make their own business more efﬁcient by sharing our expertise on
ofﬁces and offering them already tested effective solutions we also encourage our employ
ees in adopting green practices by offering specialized training following our successful
certiﬁcation of iso 50001 we organized during this year training sessions on the topics
of energy efﬁciency for ofﬁce buildings all of our new as well as existing employees took
part in this training such investment can eventually minimize our environmental impact


                          fin a n c ia l h ig h l ights
in 2015 alstria made a substantial step in its corporate development by taking over its
competitor do deutsche ofﬁce ag deutsche ofﬁce in a shareforshare transaction the
combination of both companies allowed us to almost double the ofﬁce real estate portfolio




                                                                                                   economic prosperity
and to build up sizeable subportfolios in ﬁve of the six major german ofﬁce markets the
diversiﬁcation of locations and singletenant risk signiﬁcantly reduces our corporate risk going
forward and therefore improves the longterm stability of the company the bigger portfolio
also allowed us to establish local ofﬁces through the presence of local teams in our main
markets we are improving the quality of our real estate operations on a sustainable basis
as we are much closer to our assets and our tenants in our daytoday business

on the ﬁnancial side the combination with deutsche ofﬁce also offered new opportunities
as the combination of both companies allows us to substantially improve our corporate
efﬁciency and hence our operating proﬁt at the same time we did not compromise
with regard to our balance sheet quality and maintained our loantovalueratio at around
50  the bigger size of the company also allowed us to further diversify our sources of
ﬁnancing after achieving a bbb investment grade rating by standard  poors we issued
a ﬁrst corporate bond in november 2015 and a second bond in early 2016 to make use of
the opportunities in the debt capital market
we continued to redistribute most of our ﬁnancial resources to our shareholders lenders
government ofﬁcials service providers and the wider community as well as our employees
given the bigger balance sheet of the company and the associated substantial increase of
equity and debt the distribution to our shareholders and lenders also increased signiﬁcantly
as a reit company alstria barely keeps any of the proceeds generated for itself therefore
it remunerates the capital it employs both debt and equity participates in government
ﬁnancing by paying taxes and stimulates the underlying economy by investing on its assets
and employees
given the higher number of shares following the capital increase to eur 1522 million as
per yearend 2015 the dividend paid out to our shareholders amounted to eur 435 million
while our lenders received eur 433 million of interest payments for bonds and bank debt
as of yearend 2015 we employed more than 72 people excluding temporary student
employees and paid eur 121 million in compensation and beneﬁts for fulltime and part
time employees

                   on our business

physical variations from climate change change in consumer behavior and energy consump
tion practices as well as new regulatory frameworks will fundamentally transform the way
the urban landscape is constructed over time
considering the longterm nature of our business and the immovable nature of our assets
it is of key importance to take the effect of climate change on our future prospects we are
thus committed on doing our part to contribute solutions to the global challenge of climate
change
at alstria we have implemented a groupwide risk management and an early warning system
in accordance with section 91 of the german stock corporation act all risks including
those of climate change are recorded evaluated and monitored on at least a quarterly basis
to counteract climate change we mainly focus on accelerating the building efﬁciency of
existing assets and avoid participating in greenﬁeld projects

opportunity report section in the annual report 2015 pages 23 to 40

our main economic risk related to climate change is a regulatory risk the company is
exposed to the risk of increasingly numerous and constantly changing regulations notably
with regard to environmental or energy efﬁciency restrictions that might limit the possibility
of letting or operating certain buildings or impose more stringent obligations upon them

the eu energy performance of buildings directive 2002 into national law thus requiring
the establishment of minimum energy performance levels for new and existing buildings

climate change not only poses risks but also presents us with opportunities for example
being able to monitor current and future regulatory changes enables us to better control
the speed of the deterioration of our assets in addition changes in outside temperature
extremes give us the opportunity to extend the use of renewable energy sources and maintain
a comfortable indoor temperature in our buildings

finally by offering highperforming buildings and communicating with transparency on our
sustainability performance to the public we gain a competitive advantage against our com
petitors over the long term a good reputation can ultimately increase the rental potential of
our portfolio and ultimately our market value for our customers and investors

in our daily asset management we take the opportunity and responsibility to support histor
ical buildings and preserve places of cultural heritage those refurbishment projects strive to
strike the right balance between the spirit of the asset its history and future needs to meet
our tenants demands for the foreseeable future by safeguarding historical buildings we
ultimately increase the cultural value and attractiveness of our portfolio in the leasing markets
in july 2015 we were honored to have two of our buildings located in the historic kontorhaus
district and speicherstadt in hamburg inscribed to the unesco world heritage list inscrip
tion on the list conﬁrms the outstanding universal value of a cultural property which requires
protection for the beneﬁt of all humanity as the owner of these buildings we fully supported
this perennial application process

since our foundation we have consistently been committed to supporting the local economy
and to enhancing the quality of life in our surroundings this year we continued supporting
a secondleague basketball team hamburg towers in wilhemsburg hamburg beyond
the sport itself the purpose of this team is to give younger people  especially those with a
difﬁcult social backround  the opportunity to be involved in sports activities and to develop
an attitude of fair play to support this goal approximately 10  of the hamburg towers
yearly income is invested in the further development of similar social projects in the area of

wilhemsburg

we try as much as we can to keep an open ear for our local communities concerns in 2015
we had the chance to offer space to the city of hamburg in one of our buildings near the
central station to support the refugees action plan we also continued supporting the
humanitarian work of unicef in hamburg by providing it with a lease in one of our buildings
at preferential terms we further provided beneﬁcial rental agreements to diverse art and
cultural exhibitions in hamburg

for us social and environmental responsibility sees no geographic boundaries although all of
our business operations are in germany where rainfall is high we do care about the worlds
most eminent problem of water shortage and accessibility supporting the viva con agua
initiative for another year was the least that we could do the objective of this initiative is to
enable people who are living in developing countries to gain access to drinking water sixty
percent of viva con aguas proﬁt goes to longterm drinking water projects the initiative
generates these funds by selling the water bottles it produces for the purpose of ﬁnancing its
projects in 2015 we supported the initiative with more than eur 3402 2014 eur 3100
finally with regard to our own ofﬁce supplies we prefer buying only fairtrade coffee and in
that way support better trading and working conditions in developing countries



                                                  in the coming years we aim to annually
                                                  support at least two projects related with

                have acknowledged the importance of laying personal sustainability targets climate change
                limited resources and air pollution are some of the major challenges facing our society
                today at alstria we believe that only by taking a holistic approach can our society move
                forward the path to sustainability goes through the reduction of our carbon footprint and
                the resources used per building as well as the increase in the usage of renewable energy
                sources our business climate change strategy includes short medium and longterm
                plans for the energy and resource consumption of our portfolio and our corporate ofﬁces

                the climate breakthrough of 2015 has been undoubtedly the paris agreement where the
                world has decided to limit the global average temperature rise well below 2 degrees above
                preindustrial levels following this decision the german government has immediately
                responded with a development of a national climate action plan 2050 a ﬂexible policy

                 understanding the different types of utility procurement is particularly important to us for
                 determining the proper portfoliowide performance measures the procurement in our port
                 folio is organized in two types the landlordobtained energy and the tenantobtained energy
                 as a landlord we are solely responsible for the energy consumed from the shared services
                 in the common areas of our buildings and for the energy consumed in our corporate ofﬁces
                 the energy procured in tenant areas is either obtained by alstria and submetered to our
                 tenants or exclusively supplied to them by different energy providers more precisely the
                 energy for the shared services in the common areas consists of the energy consumption
                 directly in those areas such as staircase lighting and of the energy consumption in common
                 technical areas this includes services provided to the tenants such as mechanical ventilation
                 and cooling systems

                 we are continually encouraging our tenants to share their exclusive energy consumption data
                 with us however to which extent they cooperate is entirely up to them and we therefore
                 cannot directly inﬂuence their energy behaviors in many cases these data are provided to

of our buildings and in our corporate ofﬁces in 2015 the absolute energy consumption
from our portfolio increased by 19  compared to 2014 considering the fact that the size
of our portfolio doubled at the end of 2015 we are expecting to see an analogous increase
in the total energy consumption results in 2016

a full likeforlike comparison of the portfolio consumptions is provided within appendix e
the likeforlike ﬁgures for electricity from landlord shared services show a reduction of
10  which can be attributed to our efforts to reduce the energy consumption in the areas
of our main inﬂuence on the contrary the likeforlike ﬁgures for electricity in the tenant
areas show an increase of 5 

the overall heating consumption including district heating and heating with fuels shows an
overall increase of approximately 9  10  compared to the heating needs of the signiﬁcantly
milder winter of 2014 the same tendencies can be observed in the analysis of the building
energy intensities of our whole portfolio compared to the previous reporting year the
energy intensity of landlord and tenantobtained energies increased by 15  this reﬂects
an increase in the heating and electricity consumption of tenants mainly due to a longer
heating period as a consequence of a heavier winter

furthermore we applied two approaches to the analysis of the energy intensity of our
portfolio by year of building construction and by region

the comparison by year of construction shows what we had already been suspecting over
the past few years the ofﬁce buildings from the era before 1945 have good energetic
behaviors thanks to their typical sturdy structures with solid facades and basic but efﬁcient
building services buildings from the period of the 1950s to the 1970s are lacking in energy
efﬁciency as during that time new building technologies were developed and applied without
considering energy consumption not surprisingly buildings from the 1980s appear to have
the worst building efﬁciency in our portfolio the extensive use of poorquality glass façades
and nonefﬁcient building technologies in an age of massive corporations expansion makes
them perfect candidates for future refurbishment finally in the 1990s and the following
two decades building efﬁciency appears to have gotten steadily better as new energy con
servation laws and innovative building solutions demonstrate their positive effects already

the regional analysis of our portfolio shows a wide spectrum of energy intensities this is
directly linked to the predominant building ages of the regional portfolios most of the oldest
buildings of our portfolio are located in hamburg enriched with many buildings from the
1950s to the 1970s the regional portfolio with the youngest building construction age is
concentrated in the rhein  ruhr area whereas in stuttgart our portfolio consists mostly of
building complexes from the 1980s

                cent by 2050 and thereby playing their part         total consumption this is also heavily linked
                in limiting the average global temperature          to the companys economic feasibility and
                rise to well below 2 degrees celsius above          the implementation of new innovative
                preindustrial levels en route to realizing this   technologies our short and mediumterm
                ambitious but necessary target all business        actions are concentrated on procurement
                sectors including real estate need to take        strategies for renewable energies to allow a
                action one of the top priorities for our long     quick start into a carbon neutral future
                term strategy is to reduce the total energy
                consumption of our portfolio




                         electricity
                we started buying energy from renewable sources in 2013 for covering the electricity demand
                of our controlled areas and when acquiring it on behalf of our tenants in 2015 we decided
our buildings




                to enter into a framework agreement for procuring 100  of our electricity from renewable
                sources hydropower over a fouryear period with this action we showed our ambition
                and commitment to running our business with the less harm possible to the environment

                our ultimate goal is to stimulate our tenants in adopting similar environmentally sound
                practices and thus we offer them an opportunity to procure electricity from renewable
                sources with the same conditions of the framework contract more information for our tenant
                                                       
                electricity pool is available online at wwwmieterstrompoolde while we understand that
                the electricity actually used in the assets might still be generated by fossil fuels our inten
                tion is to increase the demand in the market place for green electricity and consequently
                incentivize investment in that ﬁeld

                german privacy and energyrelated laws until today made it impossible for landlords to
                acquire directly electricity consumption data in the tenant areas this problem is expected
                to be solved with the new digital metering law digitalisierung der energiewende that was
                passed in july 2016 this law will enable landlords to be fully responsible for the implemen
                tation and maintenance of smart metering systems in their buildings immediately upon
                being informed of the enactment of the current law we made the decision to start by the
                end of 2016 with the rollout of smart metering systems for shared services in our buildings
                the rollout of smart metering for electricity in the tenant areas will follow in 2017 this will
                give us an opportunity to receive all of the consumption data of our portfolio and design
                the appropriate energyefﬁcient measures




                                                                                                         alstria

        heating
our preferred solution with regard to heating systems is district heating germanys district
heating supply system uses waste heat from refuse incineration plants and combined heat
and power plants chps this process saves energy that otherwise would be lost and
substantially reduces carbon emissions and pollutants our second choice when it comes to
choosing a heating supply system is natural gas as of 2015 we were responsible for most
of the procurement of natural gas in our buildings 34 of 48 buildings with the beginning
of our new framework agreement in 2016 all natural gas we obtain will be carbon neutral
via offsetting

however carbon offsetting is not the path we want to pursue we are strongly convinced
that district heating is the better option and we thus replace whenever possible fuelbased
heating systems with district heating in the case where our buildings have no access to a
district heating grid we choose to replace the old heating systems such as oil to cleaner
and more efﬁcient natural gas

over the medium term we assume that district heating will become more carbon neutral
 a development that we will monitor electric heating generated by heat pumps is also
another system we expect to grow in demand in the market currently it is not typically
used in large ofﬁce buildings yet we believe that heating with electricity from renewable
sources will be a good carbonneutral alternative for ofﬁces in the long run in the future we
might consider switching the heating systems in some of our buildings to alternatives such
as biogas hydrogen and electricity if those present us with better carbonneutral choices
by 2050 we expect that most heating consumption will be 100  carbon neutral




                                                                                                  our buildings

                 that by measuring water consumption properly we can manage water more effectively
                 therefore we publish and share our water usage data every year

                 the same applies to the measurement of the waste generation of our portfolio to increase

as a longterm real estate investor we hold assets over their entire lifecycles during an
assets lifetime two key moments can result in the creation of signiﬁcant value the ﬁrst is
when a lease expires and a new lease needs to be put in place this is the bread and butter
of each and every real estate company the second moment is when an asset undergoes
refurbishment or redevelopment this is the process that shapes the asset for the next 20 to
30 years it deﬁnes its future cash ﬂow its ability to be let and the experience of its occupiers

at alstria we design for the safety health and comfort of the buildings users including
aspects such as natural lighting and thermal insulation having the choice between a standard
building technology and an energyefﬁcient one we are likely to select a solution subject
to the best available technology at no extra cost batnec approach we also design to
enhance the quality of life around our buildings we thus try to integrate an asset within
a vivid environment including access to essential daytoday needs and connectivity to
public transport

our business model involves an annual review of each of our assets to determine the need
for any preventive capital expenditure and renovations in 2015 we invested approximately
eur 28 million in refurbishment measures and eur 117 million in development projects

                our buildings every day are welcoming thousands of employees visitors tenants suppliers
                and contractors they provide space for businesses to operate more effectively and to con
                tribute to the wellbeing of their occupants
                our goal when we design an ofﬁce space is the creation of longterm value for our tenants
                our local communities our partners and ourselves we consider the following factors to be
                important to increase the immaterial value of our ofﬁce buildings

                 health and safety
                 visual and thermal comfort
                 indoor air quality
                 ease of access to recreation areas and transport

                health and comfort
                we understand the pivotal role that our buildings play in their environment and the risks
                they may impose to the health of their occupants and the communities surrounding them
                at alstria we take the health safety and comfort of our employees tenants suppliers
                contractors and local communities very seriously we comply with applicable german health
                and safety regulations

                our main focus is to prevent potential risks for people and the environment our objective
                is to rebuild or refurbish buildings to make them more durable and increase the occupants
our buildings




                wellbeing to achieve this we run for every building that we acquire a duediligence process
                that includes the monitoring of technical regulatory environmental and health and safety
                procedures and risks including soil pollution and climate change

                during the redevelopment of an asset we communicate our construction activities and
                our time plan to the affected tenants and to the immediate neighbors beforehand in the
                occasion of a conﬂict of interest we aim to ﬁnd solutions and to reduce the negative effects
                for our tenants this includes minimizing the incremental noise generated by our activities
                on all construction sites

                every construction company working for us is responsible for the safety and training of its
                workers to ensure optimal work in a construction site bg bau the german social accident
                insurance institution for the building trade supervises all of our sites regularly for the safety
                and training of workers additionally sigeko the safety and health coordinator is enti

                with the termination of workers contracts when proved necessary since the founding of
                the company in 2006 there have been no fatal accidents neither at our ofﬁces nor at our
                constructions sites

accessibility to transport
when it comes to real estate location is everything in the context of growing cities the
locations of ofﬁce buildings and their access to transportation networks determine in part
their lettability due to the immobile nature of our assets and the limited control we have
over their surroundings it is essential for us to know their connectivity to the urban fabric
for this reason we have decided to run a survey on our complete portfolio 119 buildings
to examine their accessibility to existing transportation systems
to deﬁne the level of accessibility to transport we set 13 rating criteria in ﬁve broader
categories type of transport number of transport lines frequency of transport innovative
transportation models distance to local supplies and recreational areas

the ﬁve categories of the survey are
public transport distance to metro  bus  tram stations bicyclesharing car parking
long distance transport access  distance to airport central railway stations highways
innovative transport access  distance to emobility charging stations carsharing
local supply access  distance to food supply drugstores pharmacies atm  banks
recreation areas access  distance to public parks green areas

the study was focused on the typical interests of the occupants of our buildings each
criterion was evaluated based on two parameters  distance and access to existing transpor

the results of this analysis show that more than 55  of our buildings have a good to very
good access to transportation systems and local supplies this can mainly be attributed to the
composition of our portfolio with most of our buildings located in dense metropolitan areas

more than 41  of our buildings were found to have a charging station for electric cars in a
distance of less than 500 meters following this new trend many of our tenants started in
cooperation with us to install charging points in their parking lots for new electric vehicles
to support the transition to emobility we will continue exploring our sites for potential
public charging stations following this survey we will review the buildings that received a
poor rating and deﬁne the appropriate measures we need to take to improve their transport
accessibility

                are only a few companies in the reit industry spending money on rd at alstria we started
                thinking about supporting fundamental research as we tried to identify the trends we should
                incorporate into our analysis of our portfolio

                after initially supporting the research of professor chabinycs lab at the university of cali
                fornia santa barbara and his work on organic photovoltaics last year we have decided to
                continue supporting it for another year we consider that this key technological development
                will allow for better usage of building structures to produce energy and consequently will
                allow us to be energy independent in the years to come

                a major milestone we achieved in this year was the creation of the ﬁrst coworking place

                water in our corporate ofﬁces in hamburg and düsseldorf increased by 6  in comparison

                water distribution system and thus reduce the amount of water required to operate the entire
                building the rainwater collected helped us to save approximately 40  of our annual fresh

construction waste
we report on the waste of our redevelopment projects on a regular basis however a
comparison of these data is not possible due to the different designs of our buildings and
the different types of waste that are generated moreover our development projects are
at different stages so even a comparison between two reporting periods of one project is
not feasible
during 2015 construction waste was generated due to the refurbishment of one asset in
hamburg the harburger ring in our development project in ditzingen we were able to
recycle almost the entire demolition waste on site in 2015 more than 24000 tonnes of
concrete and construction waste were reintroduced into the new construction and not
transported to any landﬁll site

in 2015 we printed 1560 kg equal to 300000 sheets of paper this corresponds to
16 sheets of paper per employee per working day the paper used is fsc certiﬁed the
printers consumed 2  of our annual electricity consumption in our ofﬁces

after the takeover of the deutsche ofﬁce our portfolio grew substantially even though
those buildings were part of our portfolio for the last two months of 2015 we decided to
report on their energy consumptions for landlord shared services and associated emissions
scope 2 in the same manner as we do for our existing buildings
due to this fact the total scope 2 emissions appear to have grown in comparison to the
previous years this will change signiﬁcantly once our efﬁcient measures and our procurement
strategies are implemented in the new portfolio

                                    workforce
alstria is constantly growing the number of employees increased by 14  from 63 people in
2014 to 72 people in 2015 this signiﬁcant increase can be attributed to the recent acquisition
of the deutsche ofﬁce which nearly doubled the size of our portfolio and strengthened our
workforce more than half of our employees tasks are related to operating activities such as
management acquisition and development of real estate the other part of the workforce
is split between administrative departments such as ﬁnance  controlling legal reporting 
accounting and ofﬁce administration

we offer secure jobs and provide longterm career prospects to our employees in 2015 the
number of employees under ﬁxedterm contracts remained at 6  these contracts were
mainly offered for replacement positions and twoyear trainee program positions
at alstria when a business cycle closes or our staffs needs change we take every possible
measure to retain our people instead of releasing them these measures include employee
transfer to equivalent positions in other departments and training them to succeed in their
new roles voluntary transfer to equivalent positions in different locations and promotion
from within in the event of an inhouse vacancy in 2015 3  of people were internally
promoted our main target is to keep our annual employee turnover rate below 10  in
2015 we reached our goal with having an employee turnover rate of 8 
with respect to the recent takeover of the deutsche ofﬁce we followed our principle of
keeping our people offering all of the deutsche ofﬁces employees a position at alstria
more than 30  of deutsche ofﬁce employees accepted this option those who decided
not to join alstria were offered generous compensation packages

             later retirements and longer life spans have resulted in four generations of people working
             together in the same workplace this new normal calls for ﬂexibility and foresight at alstria
             our recruitment policies are designed to attract develop and retain the best talents on the
             market we strive to create an inclusive work environment where the contribution of each
             individual is valued and equal treatment is fostered

             aside from speciﬁc positions that require certain expertise or technical knowhow nearly all
             recruiting is handled inhouse and guided by our hr specialists the common recruitment
             process includes a twostep selection interview attended by the associated senior manager a
             team member and an hr specialist in this interview applicants are handled individually and
             are presented with a set of fundamental questions as well as case studies another common
             practice is the applicant days a program usually used to select young professionals for
             trainee positions this offers us the advantage of getting to know the candidate better and
             simultaneously allows the candidate to learn more about our corporate culture and people

             all interviews are held fairly and objectively we differentiate ourselves from our peers by
             holding a fast and inclusive recruitment process and by treating our applicants with trans
             parency from the ﬁrst encounter the selection criteria are occasionally reviewed to ensure
             they are suitable for achieving the companys objectives and preventing discrimination
             as a matter of principle we seek to hire people from the local community we post available
             positions on our website job portals and social media

             we consider trainee programs particularly favorable to our corporate culture for they increase
             internal interdisciplinary cooperation and improve longterm succession planning within the
             company therefore we hire young professionals every year to complete a twoyear trainee
             program especially designed to provide handson experience with our real estate business and
             our corporate culture since this programs inception in 2013 we have hired six trainees four
             have successfully ﬁnished their traineeship and three now form part of our permanent staff

             everyone at alstria has the opportunity to learn and to improve skills while working it is in
             our own best interest that employees continue their career development and extend their
             knowledge and qualiﬁcations as desired for this reason employees are offered a wide
             variety of learning and development opportunities that build on their strengths grow their
             skills and help them achieve their full potential

             to this end we offer ﬂextime and pay our employees training costs in most cases in
             2015 we spent approximately eur 113000 on training sessions 2014 eur 131000 this
             investment represented an average of eur 1570 per employee each employee received an
             average of 27 hours of training 2014 25 hours female employees received an average of
             29 hours of training and male employees received 25 hours

             our training program is based on our business needs and employees personal interests at
             the start of the year each employee undergoes an annual appraisal guided by the manager
             in charge in which a variety of topics are discussed including individual career development
             planning after this session the employees speciﬁc training goals are further discussed and
             agreed upon by hr specialists after the successful completion of training sessions the
             employee is evaluated by his supervisor at the following annual appraisal


                                                                                                     alstria

this years emphasis has been on supporting new employees in quickly adjusting to their
new positions accordingly onboarding sessions and especially it ofﬁce programs amounted
to 10  of the total number of training hours topics related to real estate totaled the most
hours at 66  of the total number of training hours provided within the company another
important program which was fully implemented in 2015 provided senior managers with
speciﬁc training to develop business and soft skills management training will continue to
take place once a year contributing to future successful senior management a detailed
breakdown of employee training is provided in the chart below

our training cycle ends each year with a unique twoday offsite team event the main
objective of this workshop is to inform all employees of the companys annual performance
and upcoming projects during this workshop employees receive training in various topics
such as compliance mechanisms human rights aspects sustainability and energy strategy
at the same time employees participate in team activities and have the opportunity to share
their ideas on a variety of topics which allows employees to genuinely contribute to the
companys corporate identity

             at alstria we honor variety and multiculturalism in our perspectives as illustrated by the fact
             that our staff includes people from eight different nationalities representing three different
             continents

             we are committed to promoting gender diversity and increasing the representation of women
             in management positions as of september 2015 the management board has determined
             that female representation for the ﬁrst management level below the management board
             shall not fall below 273  until june 2017 a target quota for female representation for
             the second management level has not been determined for the company has no further
             management level with decisionmaking competence and budget responsibility a similar
             target of 30  for has been set for the supervisory board until 2017

in 2015 we employed 41 women and 31 men this equates to a femaletomale ratio of
57  to 43  2014 48  to 52  the share of female employees in senior management
positions was 33   10  2014 30  in germany the equivalent proportion of women
in senior positions was 13   in the supervisory board the female representation was
167  in germany the equivalent proportion was 226 

we consider equal remuneration for female and male employees a key priority even a
necessity in 2015 female employees at alstria earned 31  less on average than male
employees 2014 13  in germany the equivalent difference in similar industries was
30  32  however across equivalent positions the salaries of female and male employees
are aligned and do not differ more than 0  6

with a business history spanning almost ten years alstria has a relatively young workforce
whose average age is 37 years old given that the number of years each employee works
for the company is increasing as is the retirement age we expect to eventually have four
generations of people working at the same place

when it comes to the creation of a new location of operations or a new division we recruit




                                                                                                         our people
people regardless of age for example during our recent business expansion with local oper
ational teams in frankfurt düsseldorf and stuttgart we recruited mixedaged workforce
from the beginning this principle allows us to beneﬁt from the special strengths of each
age group and avoid future conﬂicts

options regarding gradual retirement have not yet been considered as none of our employees
has reached retirement age due consideration will be given once it is relevant
the measures we take in order to beneﬁt from the experiences of employees of different
ages include programs to support the health of our employees in addition we offer ﬂextime
and remote work options to complement this we raise our managers awareness of the
challenges posed by mixedage teams




                                                            over the next few years we would like to

             to perform part of their job offsite such arrangements are mainly based on the nature of

             nication to tenants and suppliers which results in managers tending to stay at the ofﬁce

deals with

 compliance with applicable laws                 dealing with ofﬁce bearers
  and regulations                                 managing of conﬂicts of interest

corruption is understood as the acceptance or granting of advantages or beneﬁts used to
unfairly inﬂuence business or ofﬁcial decisions a possible failure to prevent corrupt behavior
can have consequences not only for the individual but can also negatively affect alstrias
business ﬁnancial condition and results of operations it could also lead to an imminent loss
of alstrias reputation in the real estate market and thereby negatively affect future business
opportunities

alstrias operations are located exclusively in germany where the legal environment and
business practices against corruption bribery and labor rights abuse are binding and mature
in order to systematically protect the group from corruptionrelated risks we have imple
mented an earlywarning risk identiﬁcation system that evaluates and monitors all associated
risks at least on a quarterly basis this evaluation helps deﬁne speciﬁc prevention measures
which include various controls and access security measures the groups anticorruption
policies are supervised by the compliance ofﬁcer moreover we maintain a twoman rule
as a control mechanism for most internal processes the materialization of compliance risks
including corruption is assessed as unlikely unchanged from the previous year




                                                to safeguard the company from poten
                                                tial compliance risks we are planning to
                                                strengthen our process for risk assessment
                                                and enhance the principles that govern
                                                employee behavior

                  icantly dependent on our service providers

                  and builders

business ethics




                  to us every service provider is equally important and can have both a positive or negative
                  impact on the companys reputation therefore when entering into new business relation
                  ships we prefer to trust service providers that have been previously vetted with respect to
                  certain activities that may expose us to high compliance risks

                  as a result we have established a green list that includes all the providers with whom
                  the company is allowed to enter into a business relationship contractors on this list have
                  been vetted for reputation and market behavior prior to the companys engagement in any
                  business with them the green list is compiled by all senior managers and supervised by
                  the compliance ofﬁcer on an annual basis

                  over the last few years we have developed many strategies and key tools to support rela
                  tionships with our service providers and suppliers since 2014 we have included a range of
                  issues in our contracts such as energy efﬁciency waste recycling and the use of ecofriendly
                  materials furthermore we have enhanced most of our building contracts with provisions
                  covering protection of minimum wages

                  the most important step we took this year with regard to improving our supplier relationship
                  management was the creation of a code of conduct for service providers and suppliers this
                  code similar to the one for employees deﬁnes the companys ethical and legal guidelines and
                  sets forth the speciﬁc behavior expected from our service providers and suppliers we direct
                  all existing and potential business partners to read the code of conduct on the companys
                  website and be aware that compliance with the code is recommended the code is available

refurbishment development and maintenance of our buildings this year this corresponds
to supporting 324 jobs in the construction sector 2014 205 jobs this year we contin

contractors




                                               we will continue our intensive efforts to

             joint ventures in order to increase comparability between years we provide results on
             the most recent two full reporting years by applying this likeforlike approach to our
             portfolio we are able to disregard assets that were added or excluded from the portfolio
             during the reporting period and solely focus on the ones that have contributed over the
             entire period however a likeforlike comparison can only be applied to absolute indicators
             whereas intensity indicators take the total portfolio at the date of reporting into account for
             measuring properly our carbon footprint we apply the operational control approach of the
             greenhouse gas protocol initiative this approach clearly identiﬁes emissions in areas over
             which we have direct control and where emissions accrue due to the companys activities
             overall no adjustments for special circumstances such as weather patterns or the age of

             guidelines g4 of the gri in a limited assurance engagement the evidence gathering pro
             cedures are more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement hence the scope of
             a limited review is less comprehensive and may not reasonably assure all material facts in
             comparison with a reasonable assurance the selection of audit activities is subject to the
             auditors own judgement this includes the assessment of the risk of material misstatement

             responsibility
             as a responsible company alstria ofﬁce reitag is committed to limiting the impact of its
             operations on the overall environment to the largest extent possible in line with this objective
             the management board recognizes the signiﬁcance of energy management and provides all
             necessary reasonable resources for appropriate energy management in particular it ensures
             all of alstrias business activities will be performed in accordance with legal and regulatory
             obligations

             improvement
             we are committed to continually improving our energy management system through regular
             reviews our ultimate goal is to reduce our environmental footprint and subsequently our
             energy consumption we believe that reducing our energy demand is the most sustainable
             path for alstria in the long term whenever possible we endeavor to decrease our depend
             ence on fossil fuels by increasing the use of renewable energy sources

             energy
             we ensure the responsible use of energy throughout all business operations to this end
             we will begin a process that allows us to monitor energy data for energy used in our oper
             ational processes through such measures including operational energy audits we will be
appendix d




             able to analyze our energy requirements and identify all viable measures to save energy
             the successful implementation of these measures ensures the optimal energy use from an
             economic and environmental perspective

             awareness
             through regular and speciﬁc training sessions we keep our employees informed on our
             energy goals and encourage them to act responsibly and participate actively in our energy
             management program
             the companys illustration and understanding of its own energy consumption effectively
             raises employees awareness with regard to tenants energy requirements

             communication
             we conduct open objective and comprehensive dialogue with the public and our busi
             ness partners we also work closely with authorities and adequately inform stakeholders
             regarding relevant energy topics in so doing we develop a deeper mutual understanding

             this policy applies to all operations of alstria ofﬁce reitag

absolute values abs are used to report the indicators for the year in question all con
sumption data refer to the whole year assets under major redevelopment and buildings
that were only recently acquired without a set of consumption data for the whole running
year are excluded

the likeforlike ﬁgures lfl include all alstria buildings that have been consistently in oper
ation and their consumption data is available for the most recent twofullyear period
although the deutsche ofﬁce portfolio was acquired in the end of 2015 its consumption
data is included in the likeforlike ﬁgures depending on availability for the years 2014 and
2015

energy consumption data originates from different sources in some cases we possess only
partial data from speciﬁc areas or services of our buildings such as tenant or common area
in other cases all building consumptions are managed by our tenants singletenant build
ings and we receive nonveriﬁable data for all energy water and waste data however all
available data is used and no estimates were made to ﬁll data gaps the data from landlord
shared services in common areas is a mix of direct consumption in those areas such as stair
case lighting and consumption from shared services in common areas that are used in tenant

areas such as mechanical ventilation and cooling when calculating the intensity metrics
we use the appropriate denominators i e for the landlordshared services in common areas
we use the combined common and tenant ﬂoor space

intensity indicators int give the ratio between energy or water consumption and the cor
responding ﬂoor space for ofﬁce buildings we use in addition to the standard intensity
denominator per ﬂoor space the intensity of use denominator per workstation as well
one workstation equals 25 m² of ofﬁce space

figures from 2014 have been restated including intensity metrics as additional or more accu
rate energy consumption data have been obtained since the previous sustainability report
where necessary and possible restatements are explained in footnotes to the respective
graphics all absolute ﬁgures from 2014 include only the former alstria portfolio

all ghg emissions are reported under the operational control approach rather than ﬁnancial
or procurement control
scope 1 includes only direct dir emissions from alstria own use scope 2 includes energy
from indirect indir emissions from alstria own use and landlord shared services in common
areas scope 3 includes landlordobtained energy that was submetered to tenants and
tenantobtained energy

no district cooling is used within our portfolio

water consumption data is only from water that was submetered exclusively to tenants or
was directly obtained by tenants singletenant buildings
