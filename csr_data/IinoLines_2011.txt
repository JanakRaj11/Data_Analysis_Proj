    under the new plan we will strive to solidify our business      efficiency on our middle east and far east routes we must
    structures to enable us to achieve our numerical targets        enhance our cargo booking capabilities on return voyages to
    these targets include increasing sales from the 745 billion     the middle east after our ships have transported
    yen posted in fiscal 2010 to 860 billion yen in fiscal 2013     petrochemicals from there from the far east we already
    and then to the 100 billion yen level by middecade our         transport vegetable oils and lubricants from the far east to
    goals for operating profit are to expand from the fiscal 2010    india and pakistan and with emerging market economy
    base of 24 billion yen to 62 billion yen in fiscal 2013 and    demand for petrochemical products rising steadily we seek
    then to 10 billion yen by middecade                            to win transport business to those countries we will also
    the previous plan was focused primarily on our chemical          aggressively pursue business opportunities in regions other
    tanker business which transports mostly petrochemical           than the middle east and newly emerging countries for
    products and our real estate business growth of our gas        example we actively participate in the management of our
    tanker business was the third pillar of the plan among those    us joint venture allied chemical carriers and we plan to
    three businesses we had already made considerable               use that companys local marketing capabilities to increase
    investments in chemical tankers but other divisions of our      our shipping volumes on northsouth america routes and
    shipping business were a bit short of vessels meanwhile        european routes
    we sharply expanded revenues from our bulk carriers an          additionally we plan to expand our chemical tanker fleet
    area upon which we previously had not placed much                from 38 vessels at the end of march 2011 to around 45
    strategic importance the bulk carrier market tends to have      vessels by the end of march 2013 and then to around 50
    little correlation to trends in the chemical tanker market so   vessels by middecade
    we intend to pour our energy into expanding this business
    as well as our chemical tanker and real estate operations       steady growth via review of existing
                                                                     businesses and new investments
    next please explain the specific policies of the new
    mediumterm plan ieg14 the plans theme is growth and         you noted that bulk carrier profitability has increased so do
    evolution and you have established reformation              you intend to make that business line your third growth
    stabilization and growth as the plans three pillars
    based on five cornerstone action goals starting with
    bolster resilience to market fluctuations see diagram on
    page 4 under reformation the plan calls for
    restructuring of the chemical tanker division what specific
    measures are planned

    chemical tanker shipping is our groups core business and
    the previous mediumterm plan aimed to further grow our
    chemical tanker operations we expect demand for marine
    transport using chemical tankers will continue to expand
    globally and therefore plan to further strengthen these
    operations under our new plan the iino groups core route
    is the middle east  far east route where we command a
    worldleading share of shipping volumes for petrochemical
    products we intend to build upon this strength and further
    expand our market leading share
    the iino group aims to build a solid operating base that will
    enable not just its chemical tanker business but its entire
    oceangoing shipping operations to perform stably despite
    fluctuations in such external factors as freight rates and
    exchange rates specifically the new plan aims to boost
    profitability through such measures as reducing unprofitable
    vessels using of larger vessels on specific routes and
    enhancing transport efficiency for example to enhance

tell us about new measures being taken in the shipping                   monitoring demand for these products and changes in that
business other than in the chemical tanker division                     demand we intend to expand our fleets of large and small

to date we have concentrated our investments on chemical
tankers and real estate but now we seek to diversify                    ieg14 also targets the development of small and
investments as part of that effort we will be closely                  mediumsize vessel business as a means of capturing

as we implement the various measures of ieg14                           of economic growth in these countries
with the global economy marking time growth in the

contracted vessels provide a steady source of earnings and              during a downturn in the shipping market but we also have
we therefore plan to expand our fleet of contracted                      our sights set on developing new shipping business by
dedicated vessels to maintain longterm contracts for these             capturing demand from these emerging markets

needs a sound safety record and strong relations with                  business we are already operating small bulk carriers for
customers built on mutual benefits and trust we intend to               transporting fertilizers and steel materials and we are
continue forging strong ties with all of our customers                  considering adding to this fleet and expanding these
nuclear power plant shutdowns will certainly raise demand                operations we also plan to secure profits by improving
in japan for lng used in power generation meanwhile in                  efficiency on our shipping routes by transporting steel
the united states shale gas is attracting attention as a new            materials from japan to the middle east and then on return

    the buildings tenants the iino hall housed in the old iino       base
    building was popular with performing artists and their

    with these stakeholders when the new iino building opens           as a result our interestbearing debt will rise this year and
    the march 11 earthquake in japan has renewed interest and           next however we do not consider the increased debt burden
    concern about disaster prevention in large cities while global     itself as a negative as it represents an investment in more
    warming and the power shortage problem facing japan are             stable earnings in the future going forward of course we will

    the need to use less energy we are confident that our attention    position back down to a more optimal level
    to disaster prevention and environmental issues when                one way in which we intend to reduce interestbearing debt
    reconstructing the iino building will make it japans no 1         is to lower our high ratio of owned vessels and rely more on
    building from the perspectives of earthquake resistance and         chartered ships this will at the same time raise our
    environmental performance including energy efficiency             resistance to fluctuations in shipping market conditions
    moreover the building is in a prime location situated beside      looking at specific figures we expect our interestbearing

     fiscal 2010 performance
     we secured stable earnings from both large lpg and large

     longterm contracts we also managed to renew shipping
     contracts on favorable terms during the year additionally
     amid firm freight rates and taking into account prevailing
     shipbuilding prices we secured medium and longterm
     contracts for newly built large lpg tankers


     fiscal 2011 outlook
     with only a limited number of newbuilds entering the market
     despite the anticipated scrapping of superannuated vessels
     large lpg tanker freight rates should remain firm as the
