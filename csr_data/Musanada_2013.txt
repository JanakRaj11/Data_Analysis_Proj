    on this blessed land lived our fathers and
     forefathers and by instinct they had a delicate
     sense of the necessity to preserve our land and
     marine environment which reflected on their
     keenness to take of it just what they needed
     and leave what remained unexhausted to the
     upcoming generations let our will today that
     we follow the example set by our ancestors
     and uphold our responsibility towards the
     environment by preserving it on land and in the
     sea not only for our own welfare but also for
     the sake of the next generations it is a pledge
     that we have taken before our ancestors and
     the pledge shall be fulfilled by this generation
     and the next and the next
