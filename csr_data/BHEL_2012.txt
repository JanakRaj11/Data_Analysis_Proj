opment with that of conserving the environment as it is at a tipping point the awareness of sustain
able development issues has never been so great especially in relation to energy and climate change
vis√†vis growth of economy we must manage our rich natural resource base to ensure that future
generations can draw the same benefits from them as we are able to get today in this regard our
strategic plan 201217 lays emphasis on sustainable development and a sustainability strategy has
been formulated
there is a need for breakthrough technologies for electricity generation clean use of coal efficient use
of natural resources low carbon transport systems more efficient transmission systems and energy
efficient buildings to live up to the cause of sustainable development

dear stakeholders
the first sustainability report on environment for the year 201112 is here this is a result of many
concentric and dedicated efforts of corporate hse  csr team  unit level nodal officers to address
the long term goal of sustainable development we have created two tier frame work within bhel
a steering committee at the corporate level mentors the journey in term of transforming and
translating vision of the organisation in line of the mission and policy whereas nodal officer at each
manufacturing unit level conforms with the vision in shaping the manufacturing unit towards a
common future
bhel units are already having management systems approach to deal and address initiatives our
existing management systems have helped us reach this stage of information disclosure
in line with the various environmental needs we have carved our csr  sustainability initiatives
penetrating deep down into the society these csr initiatives strengthen our bonding with our
very own employees and community initiatives such as water harvesting projects green belt
development mass awareness about water conservation energy efficiency and conservation
usage of renewable energy employees community involvement in various awareness programmes
on environmental protection etc are to name a few

materials and specific units of measurement has been given below

energy management is an important thrust
area in bhel so energy conservation and energy
efficiency has always been a very important
endeavor for bhel as a result of various energy
efficiency and conservation initiatives in the
process redesign conversionretrofitting of
equipment changes in personnel behavior etc
taken at units total 167 tj of energy has been
avoided during 201011 during this period
nearly 11 million unit of electricity usages was

                                                    40

avoided due to such initiatives this year the major contribution
of energy use avoidance has come from fuel switch 126 tj
bhel has formed a broad framework for energy conservation
across the organisation
major activities undertaken for energy conservation during the
financial year 201112 were
1 key personnel were certified as energy manager energy
auditor at manufacturing units
2 energy conservation week was celebrated across the
   company from 14th to 21st december several competitions like painting essay writing in regional
   language quiz were organized in units offices schools and townships
3 energy audit was conducted by external agencies like pcra teri etc at hpep hyderabad ip jagdishpur
   and epd bangalore to find ofi opportunities for improvement
4 solar street lighting had been installed to tap renewable energy
5 guidelines for procurement of energy efficient equipment on the basis of lcca life cycle costing

due to various initiatives taken up to reduce the direct and indirect ghg emission bhel has avoided ghg
emission of approx 20452 mt co2  equivalent this is a quantum jump from avoided emission of 6277
mt co2  e this can be attributed to reduction in kcal of fuel consumption at cffp haridwar resulting in
significant emission avoidance
at most the units use of ods in refrigerators and chillers has been stopped and at the remaining units it is
being phased out the emission of ods was 173 kg of cfc  11 equivalent for the year 201112

the above also includes wood reused for manufacturing wooden boxes used for packaging of the product
this reduces the input material for packaging purposes also nonhazardous waste include ferrous and non
ferrous scrap also which are recycled and reused at units

significant spills
no significant spill has occurred during the reporting period
however minor spillage particularly at the time of preventive
machine maintenance is taken care of according to environmental
management practices iso 14001 2007 adopted

environmental impacts of products  services
being a major player in the arena of power equipments bhel
understands that it has imperative to help the customer in mitigating
the environmental impacts of power generation through its               coolant recycling plant at hep bhopal
equipment with this view bhel has been actively developing and
acquiring clean technologies for power generation enabling its customers to minimize the impact of power
generation on the environment product pertaining to power generations has been evolving since inception
of company based on the current needs these products became efficient in terms of heat rating some
examples of various initiatives taken by bhel in power plant equipment design to mitigate the environmental
impacts of its products and services are as below
   supercritical units these units have a better heat rate than the conventional sub critical units and
    consume less coal per mw this aids in reduction of co2 emission
   electrostatic precipitators the fly ash from the flue gases are segregated  collected by the electrostatic
    precipitators besides they also reduce particulate matter emission
   boiler burner design for low nox low nox burners and over fire air arrangement help to reduce nitrogen
    oxides emission
   circulating fluidised bed boilers it leads to higher absorption of sulphur in the combustor with lime
    addition and also reduces the emission of sulphur oxides
   flue gas desulphurising systems fgd it helps in removal of sulphur oxides from the flue gas thereby
    reducing sulphur oxides emission
in addition bhel has taken several steps for process improvements to minimize the impact of power
generation on the environment some of these steps are
   boiler chemical cleaning change from hcl to edta a comparatively mild acid with a changed procedure
   pado systems performance analysis diagnostics and optimisation improved efficiency through better
    operations thereby leading to reduced coal consumption and emission levels during power plant life
    cycle

                                                       45

bhel also supplies energy efficient products like ac drives igbt based propulsion systems variable speed
 frequency drives etc to address conservation of energy bhel manufactures products like static var
compensator phase shifting transformers control shunt reactor facts etc

additionally bhel units have taken many steps to reduce the environmental impacts in its boundary as well
