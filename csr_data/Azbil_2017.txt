the requirements of gas companies it successfully turned knowhow
and technologies of azbil kimmon co ltd into a commercial reality
of which odawara gas is a user conventionally in gas conduit con
struction medium and lowpressure meters are set up separately this
requires switching between meters during construction according to the
measurement range giving extra workload and potential danger taking
advantage of the newly developed pressure meter which can undertake
continuous measurement without the need for switching odawara gas
has reduced its workload improved safety and sped up construction the
new pressure meter is currently acknowledged widely as a groundbreak
ing product and used by many gas companies



998 of electricity generation and also foster a transition from heavy oil
to natural energy seaside hotel yakushima took various measures under a
proposal from azbil corporation specifically it installed a highly efficient
heat source and applied various kinds of automatic control technologies
to both improve comfort and optimize energy consumption of indoor
spaces it also introduced a central monitoring system to allow visualiza
tion of the buildings status as a result it reduced the cost of heavy oil
consumption to onethird and cut carbon dioxide co2 emissions by 68
by monitoring the temperature of the entire hotel including guest rooms
it also established a system that always provides comfortable spaces for
customers this has become a model case for yakushima known for its
commitment to environment protection and reduction of co2 emissions




energy efficiency a focus of growing social pressure with this mind the
university selected azbil corporation as an esco1 operator to resolve
the issue in addition to renewal of aging heat source equipment azbil
introduced a bems2 and control methods to optimize operation of air
conditioning equipment as a result we achieved a challenging energy
usage reduction target462 of reduction from the annual average
for the most recent threeyear periodwhile maintaining highlevel tem
perature and humidity control required by the facility

the company adopted the azbil groups approach of making use of the
most of the plants existing facilities such as chillers cooling towers and
pumps optimizing the control of new heat sources and making use of an
esco plan a type of plan that guarantees energysaving effectiveness as
a result the woodlands dhc plant achieved a large reduction in electricity
consumption by 228 million kwyear far above its initial target after these
proven results similar measures were adopted at the changi and biopolis
dhc plants which reduced the companys electricity consumption by over 8
million kwyear at three dhc plants in total again much above their targets

of a hardtoclean bellows cover helps to reduce the burden on
maintenance workers whose work previously included cleaning                                                                                                                                magnetic coupling

           the model f4h compact digital mass flow controller
           which is 50 the size of conventional models
           illustrates our using resources wisely initiative
                                                                                                                                 conventional model
           in june 2016 azbil corporation introduced its model f4h compact dig
           ital mass flow controller which is easy to use and easy to incorporate
           into manufacturing equipment for purposes of factory automation
              the f4h retains the responsiveness and controllability of existing mod
           els but its functions have been narrowed down to what is necessary for
           use with electrical and electronic component manufacturing equipment
           and various analyzers and incubators for fields such as physics and chem
           istry this enabled us to reduce its size to 50 of previous models
              accordingly new equipment that incorporates this controller can be
           made more compact and the f4h can be installed in existing equip
           ment where space is limited                                                            100
              moreover the controller is easy to use thanks to improvements in
           noise immunity which is necessary for incorporation into manufactur
           ing equipment as well as multiplegas compatibility operation with
           generalpurpose 24 v power supplies and 420 ma output all of
           which helps to reduce the total cost

    protecting the earths environment
       reducing the environmental impact of society through our core businesses
    the amount of co2 emission reduction at our customers sites in the fiscal year ended march 2017 which totals 3210000
    tons is equivalent to approximately 1400 of all co2 emissions in japan approx 13 billion tons the scope of these cal
    culations has been expanded to reflect the international expansion of our businesses
    in order to assess the reduction of environmental impact quantitatively the effects were classified into the three categories of 1 effects from automation 2 effects
    from energy management and 3 effects from maintenance services in addition the reduction was calculated by comparison with the assumption that customers
    did not adopt our products or solutions at their sites the calculation of reduction in global impact was based on the conventional calculation method and partially
    on our own concept

      or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes
        since all of the azbil groups foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts are related to qualified hedges of under
      lying business exposures market gain or loss risk in the derivative instruments is effectively offset by opposite movements in the value of the
      hedged assets or liabilities
        because the counterparties to these derivatives are limited to major international financial institutions the azbil group does not anticipate
      any losses arising from credit risk
        derivative transactions entered into by the azbil group have been made in accordance with internal policies which regulate the authorization
      and credit limit amounts
