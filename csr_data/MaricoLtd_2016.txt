at marico the commitment to reducing energy consumption
is nurtured across the business the companys largest edible      diesel and furnace oil consumption reduced by
oil manufacturing plant in baddi has been certified as per
iso 50001 energy management system                                17 and 2 respectively in comparison to the
fuel consumption for process heat is an important factor           previous year
in operations marico has used biomass for generating
process heat to ensure minimal environment impact several
innovative technologies are implemented to reduce the energy
consumption as well as to use renewable energy at the plants
and corporate offices the company also conducts energy
audits every year and consistently implements measures to
improve the energy efficiency


b1 energy consumption from fuel combustion and renewables
in fy 201516 marico units consumed 327 tera joules tj of energy including that from combustion of fossil fuel diesel fo and other biomass and biomass briquettes the companys total energy
consumption increased by a small 06 corresponding to an increase in production by 16 in addition diesel and furnace oil consumption reduced by 17 and 2 respectively in comparison to
