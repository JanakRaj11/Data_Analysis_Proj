sustainability as our core business strategy


this past year marked an important milestone as the united nations adopted 17 sustainable development goals sdgs aimed at helping define those issues
around which all people can engage in order to achieve the goals of a more prosperous equitable and sustainable world it was also a year when the world
community called into question how companies relate to society in my view it seems that business is now viewed with more and more skepticism

personally i consider companies to be social beings furthermore as they exist within society companies must meet the expectations of a wide range of diverse
stakeholders stakeholders whose expectations are constantly changing and evolving companies that are unable or unwilling to meet  and exceed  these
expectations and provide solutions will not grow it is my belief that our company in particular must offer new ways to address and resolve societys many issues
through the use of our innovative mindset and sophisticated technologies i believe society is fully expecting us to employ that innovative approach and our world
class technologies to contribute to a sustainable society to meet these expectations we aim to be a truly global company and be dantotsu in all aspects of
our business

of the many issues we all face with regard to sustainability i believe that the bridgestone group is well positioned to leverage its businesses to focus on
addressing concerns in the areas of mobility and the environment while at the same time ensuring that the places where we work are better places to live

obviously we are very closely connected with mobility meaning the movement of people and things  it is our core business in addition to tires for automobiles
our involvement in providing mobility solutions to the mining industry and other commercial industries involved in the transport of people goods and products
offers opportunities for doing so more efficiently and in ways that are more environmentally friendly we will center our innovation activities on technologies and
solutions that will support these opportunities and which will benefit society and our planet

building trust and respect both in our communities and with our employees is essential for our sustainable growth therefore we are committed to contributing to
improvements in the way people live and work with a special focus on initiatives which support three themes contributing to a safer society accessible and
inclusive education and promoting healthier communities

the state of our environment represents one of the truly pressing issues facing humankind it is no exaggeration to say our earth is at risk abnormal weather
events and patterns of the sort previously seen only once many decades or even every 100 years have grown relatively commonplace it is therefore imperative
that we offer more ways to address this crisis through both technology and social systems we must accelerate our environmental initiatives not just at the
individual company level but also through activities by and through global industry associations such as the tire sector group of the world business council for
sustainable development

in order to grow as a company while simultaneously addressing issues related to sustainability one approach is to focus on the evolution from providing goods
to providing goods  services for instance one area of our business involves the sale of large tires for mining applications this is an area where quality
requirements are rigorous and efficiency considerations are paramount another area of our business relates to the supply of conveyor belts to mines for which
quality demands are also stringent until recently we responded to the customers needs for each of these product lines through separate business units
concentrating on the products themselves moving forward we will propose combined product and service packages the new offerings will go beyond merely
supplying tires or belts to customers and instead will employ technology to monitor mine conditions and recommend product and service combinations that
provide optimum efficiencies for the mine operators as well as provide services that can identify need for new products or services before a breakdown or a
problem occur should a problem occur however we will respond promptly and be in the best position to provide the product and service combinations most
useful to the customer this approach will enable us to use resources more efficiently throughout the products service life it will also generate social value by
enhancing the management of products at the end of their useful lives thereby further reducing the mining customers environmental impact as we shift from
selling individual products to providing solutions our goal is to be the partner of choice for companies from the time the mine is in its development stages through
the full course of its operations with our business growing both in terms of customer value and social value

in addition to providing a solutionsbased offering to the mining industry we offer tire retread and maintenance services for trucks and buses as well as on the
road service packages that leverage our retail network for passenger cars our technology delivers a variety of solutions including nvh solutions that provide
a combined approach to solving passenger concerns regarding noise vibration and ride comfort harshness we will continue to offer ever higherquality
service combinations that we alone are equipped to provide this approach will result in a business model that moves us from supplier to business partner
providing value while also helping to build a sustainable society in collaboration with our customers

bridgestone is participating in the olympic movement as a worldwide top partner of the olympic games through the summer of 2024 the olympics span a
variety of segments and groups which i believe makes it a truly global and universal platform bridgestone operates in alignment with its mission of serving
society with superior quality and endorses the fundamental principles of the olympic movement which is to place sport at the service of the harmonious
development of humankind with a view to promoting a peaceful society and the preservation of human dignity for these reasons we are extremely proud to
become a worldwide partner and will communicate to the world the bridgestone messagechase your dreamthrough the highest level of performance
products and services



bridgestone group                                                                6                         sustainability report 2015 full version

meanwhile we fully understand that our responsibility and obligation to serve society with superior quality includes an unwavering commitment to the safety of
our employees in all our facilities full compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as mitigating risk in all of our operations

in 2015 bridgestone unveiled its quality mission statement which together with the safety mission statement the environmental mission statement and the
bridgestone essence forms the bridgestone essence framework the safety mission statement expresses our full and absolute commitment to safety not only
to our employees and in our workplaces  where people can work with peace of mind   but to the products and services we deliver to our business partners
and endusers the environmental mission statement calls for the creation of social value through three main areas of focus being in harmony with nature
valuing natural resources and reducing co2 emissions these three areas provide clear direction regarding the manner and types of activities we will undertake
in order to support the move towards a sustainable society the quality mission statement describes commitment to the creation of customer value creation and
the establishment of a sustainable competitive advantage quality is the essence of bridgestones dna and represents an unshakable directional axis going
forward we will continue to work to further enhance instill and promote quality initiatives globally throughout the group all as articulated by the bridgestone
essence framework

society also requires that companies establish and maintain effective and efficient forms of governance that are appropriate for the enterprise as it may evolve
from time to time in that spirit and consistent with the manner is which bridgestone has grown and evolved over the years we transitioned to the company
with nominating committees etc model of corporate governance in march 2016 we determined that the introduction of this model at this time will serve to
further strengthen the companys internal control systems while enabling both more effective strategic planning and efficient decisionmaking

four years have passed since kazuhisa nishigai our coo and i joined together as a new management team and began our journey of management reform i
believe 2016 will prove to be a meaningful time for reflection as we consider the next stage of these reforms and the further development and growth of our
business this year also marks our debut as an olympic partner at the olympic games rio 2016 organizationally we have taken our first steps in developing
new business models including the launch of the mining solutions company mentioned earlier for these reasons i believe this will be a significant year for
bridgestone going forward we will continue to fulfill our social obligations and responsibilities pursue a sustainable society and strive to create common value
with our customers and society as a whole

priority issues and key actions




 reducing the impact of water intake


water intake impact reduction is given as the primary action for the minimization of impact on biodiversity the bridgestone group employs cooling water and
steam in the production process continued use of such water resources is a current production requirement that cannot be separated from continuation of
business for the group the group has therefore set the target of reducing water intake at 35 per unit by 2020 throughout the group based on 2005 levels

we are reusingrecycling water at many of the groups manufacturing facilities including operations in areas where there is serious concern for water shortage
such as china and mexico we are also using water resources more efficiently by enhancing the production process and using rainwater the results of 2015
revealed a 285 reduction per unit compared with 2005

in addition to implementing a risk assessment for water quality and volume we take efficient use of water resources and wastewater into account when building
new tire facilities we are studying corrective measures for each location by assessing risk using wbcsd global water tool2 and wri aqueduct3 at all existing
facilities

utilizing rainwater


rainwater is utilized in some plants of the bridgestone group at these plants rainwater is collected and used for
operations or watering plants within the site




reducing voc in manufacturing processes


the bridgestone group is continuously striving to switch to substitutes for chemical substances that could have a negative environmental footprint such as
volatile organic compound voc solvents thus reducing the amount of chemical substances used
as an example the group proactively worked on reducing the amount of chlorinated voc solvent used at production bases in the groups industrial chemical
department and realized a dramatic reduction of approximately 74 in a span of five years from 2010 to 2015 bridgestone also progressively switched from
voc solventbased adhesive to waterbased adhesive used for automobile seats at the bridgestone apms upper sandusky plant and dickson plant in the us
eventually eliminating voc solvents altogether the group will continue to reduce use of voc on a global basis




reducing sox and nox emissions into the air through fuel conversion


bridgestone is working to reduce emissions of sulfur oxides sox and nitrogen oxides nox at our manufacturing
facilities by converting from heavy fuel oil to natural gas by 2015 we reduced the total sox emissions by 64 and the
total nox emissions by 78 as compared to 2005

 technology provision to improve the productivity of smallscale natural rubber farmers


the majority of natural rubber production in the world is conducted by smallscale rubber farmers in southeast asia
the bridgestone group uses large volumes of natural rubber produced by such farmers however the productivity of
the rubber trees raised by these farmers is low and the quality and volume of natural rubber produced vary
to help such smallscale farmers improve the quality of their operations pt bridgestone sumatra rubber estate
bsre a subsidiary that directly operates rubber farms in indonesia provides these farmers with the productivity
improving technologies bridgestone has developed on its own rubber farms
the company started providing technical assistance to the agricultural training center established in the city of siantar in
north sumatra the company also provided hevea rubber tree seedlings and implemented a technical training program
for instructor candidates selected from various areas
such initiatives are expected to improve quality of natural rubber and income per unit area for smallscale farmers and
help control expansion of agricultural land utilization




 establishing a simple disease diagnostic technology for hevea brasiliensis a natural source of rubber


bridgestone established a breakthrough simple disease diagnostic technology for easily quickly and accurately diagnosing white root disease1 affecting hevea
brasiliensis traditionally a major source of natural rubber bridgestone utilizes the lamp method2 a diagnostic technology that makes practical use of
biotechnology using a reagent kit developed based on genome sequence information of pathogens analyzed by bridgestone this cuttingedge technology
enables simple visual confirmation of the presence or absence of pathogens without the use of special devices even when in the field this technology enables
the early detection of white root disease spread by infection caused by pathogens in the soil and is expected to prevent the spread of infection from afflicted
trees to healthy trees the development of this technology which can be used irrespective of expertise or experience is anticipated to be effective at controlling
damage while offering simplicity in terms of maintenance going forward we will continue to work with universities in indonesia and japan to promote further
developmental enhancements and contribute to the stable supply of natural rubber and the protection of hevea brasiliensis through the adoption of this
technology

1 white root disease is a disease rigidoporus microporus affecting hevea brasiliensis caused by a type of filamentous fungus the disease starts in the root system eventually spreading to the
   rest of the tree and killing it it is difficult to detect in the early stages of infection at present there is no radical treatment thus if a tree is afflicted the infected section must be removed and drug
   treatment administered as shown in the pictures below affected trees develop bundles of fungal filaments and mushroomlike growths
2 the lamp method is a gene amplification method developed by eiken chemical co ltd it is used to amplify and detect specific dna sequences for pathogens in the soil
3 the bridgestone group defines sustainable materials as those derived from resources with a guaranteed continual supply that can be used as part of the groups business over the long term and
   have a low environmental and social impact across their whole life cycle from procurement to after use

   guidelines targeting the following five domains within the supply chain

      support the improvement of natural rubber plantation productivity
      enhance natural rubber quality
      support forest sustainability through the protectionconservation of protected areas
      demonstrate appropriate water management
      demonstrate the highest respect for human and labor rights

   companies observing these guidelines will engage in voluntary activities and promote ongoing improvements related to these initiatives

   to encourage enhanced csr among suppliers and throughout the entire supply chain the bridgestone group promoted initiatives including the
   confirmation of supplier csr initiatives based on csr procurement guidelines established by bridgestone as the natural rubber supply chain is very large
   complex and often fragmented active participation in snri allows bridgestone to reach a broader number of stakeholders and likeminded organizations
   in pursuit of its longterm vision of 100 sustainable materials and in balance with nature

    sustainable natural rubber initiatives snri are an activity established by the international rubber study group irsg aimed at establishing a sustainable natural rubber economy in

in 2015 we made significant strides toward the bridgestone groups goal of using 100 sustainable materials with the
successful creation of the first tire to use natural rubber derived only from guayule from the cultivation of the guayule
to the extraction and purification of its natural rubber this tire was created through the application of the group
technologies in natural rubber assessment tire manufacturing and evaluation and all other processes

tire demand is expected to increase in conjunction with global population growth and the advancement of motorization
thus it is predicted that there will also be an increase in the consumption of natural rubber at the same time
approximately 90 of all natural rubber which accounts for a large proportion of tire raw materials is harvested from
the hevea brasiliensis rubber tree primarily grown in tropical regions of southeast asia the bridgestone group will
promote sustainable procurement to alleviate the overconcentration of natural rubber production in certain regions
through policies aimed at the expansion and diversification of sustainable resources including the research and
development of guayule which can be cultivated in arid regions

 guayule is a shrub native to the dry regions of the southwestern united states and northern mexico natural rubber is contained in the plants barks roots




the bridgestone group aims to reduce the product scrap ratio by focusing on quality management and reducing the amount of waste emitted during production
at various production bases in 2015 a total of 300000 tons of waste was generated amounting to 79 tons per 100 million of net sales a yearonyear
decrease compared to 2014 in addition the recycling rate was 897 going forward we will continue to reduce waste generation volumes and recycling rates
to contribute to the development of a society that actively recycles

in an effort to upgrade its drive to eliminate disposal of industrial waste throughout the group and bring those initiatives to facilities outside of japan the
bridgestone group has defined full zero waste to landfill status as the sustained elimination of all industrial in terms of waste final disposal volume in august
2010 all 44 facilities that the bridgestone group operated at the time in japan achieved full zero waste to landfill status which continues to this day

in terms of zero waste initiatives at manufacturing plants the plants associated with bridgestone americas inc
bsam did not dispose of any waste in landfills achieving zero waste to landfill status bsams joliette and bristol
plants as well as the bridgestone hispania sa burgos plant also achieved zero waste to landfill in 2015 in addition
all bridgestone plants in japan four tire plants in china and the nonmanufacturing akron technical center achieved
zero waste going forward bridgestone will continue initiatives to reduce waste generation and promote recycling to
contribute to the creation of a recyclingoriented society

the bridgestone group has set the longterm environmental vision of reducing its overall co2 emissions by at least 50 this vision is based on the objective
of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions at least by 50 by 2050 consistent with the goal agreed on by the leaders of g8 countries during the g8 hokkaido
toyako summit held in july 2008 this objective also was shared at the major economies meeting on energy security and climate change held the same year




looking at the life cycle of tires the stage that accounts from the largest volume of co2 emissions is usage where approximately 90 of total emissions occur
for this reason reducing tire rolling resistance can contribute to substantial reductions in co2 emissions the bridgestone groups midterm target for 2020 is to
reduce tire rolling resistance to a degree that realizes co2 emissions reductions exceeding the amount of co2 emitted in all other life cycle stages at the same
time we are working to reduce emissions in other stages of the life cycle of tires as well

bridgestone set a target of a 35 reduction in the volume of co2 emissions per net sales within manufacturing processes by 2020 in 2015 co2 emissions
decreased 370 compared to 2005 achieving this reduction target five years ahead of the target year 2020 this was due to activities aimed at reducing
wasted energy at each plant and initiatives to convert to lowco2 emissions energy usage which resulted in further reductions in co2 growth in net sales also
contributed to achieving this objective

co2 reductions are verified by a thirdparty institution in an effort to ensure the transparency of information

going forward bridgestone will promote co2 reductions throughout the entire supply chain aiming to maintain and further increase the level of reductions
currently targeted by 2020 while considering the establishment of new reduction targets

 contributing to improved fuel economy with ologic an entirely new tire concept


when a vehicle is in motion a variety of resistance factors are working against it including air resistance and tire rolling
resistance all of which reduce driving performance minimizing these resistances enable the vehicle to use less energy
which leads to improved fuel performance the bridgestone groups low fuel consumption tire technology ologic
realizes superior performance through the following two features

1 these tires have a large diameter and high internal pressure high inflated air pressure which significantly reduce
tire deformation from contact with the road surface and lower rolling resistance
2 the tires narrow tread design lowers air resistance an important factor linked to improved vehicle fuel efficiency
furthermore by optimizing the material structure and pattern of the rubber and reinforcement layers the rolling
resistance coefficient is reduced approximately 30 compared to conventional standard tires at the same time safety
performance in terms of vehicle handling on wet road surfaces is increased by approximately 101

ecopia with ologic tires employing ologic technology are standard equipment on the i3 revolutionary electric vehicle
developed by bmw they are also used on solar cars participating in the world solar challenge the worlds top solar
car race

the bridgestone group aims to reduce co2 emissions through improvements of vehicle fuel efficiency by promoting the
reduction of co2 emissions within manufacturing processes as well as the technological development and global sales
of more fuel efficient tires

citizen we comply with applicable laws regulations and company rules including in japan the antimonopoly act the unfair competition prevention law the
act on the protection of personal information and the act against unjustifiable premiums and misleading representation act ethically and make ethical
decisions that implement better business practices we also are committed to building a basis for relationships of trust with all stakeholders by conducting our
business operations in a responsible manner and with a consistent focus on ethical decisionmaking




compliance structure


bridgestone group companies have continued developing compliance structures and programs to meet societys changing expectations these programs are
designed around both the bridgestone essence and the core elements of effective compliance programs as recognized by many governments and compliance
specialists company leaders are committed to building a culture of compliance throughout the enterprise dedicated compliance teams in group companies are
committed to educating and empowering teammates to do the right thing and each employee is encouraged to live and work in the bridgestone way

for instance in 2003 bridgestone corporation appointed the chief compliance officer cco as the individual with ultimate responsibility for compliance we
also have established a department specializing in compliance support and have worked to strengthen and ensure the effectiveness of our compliance structure
the head of each business division is named a compliance activity chief with responsibility for their divisions compliance these people appoint a compliance
activity leader and work together to enhance training awareness and compliance structures within their division

bridgestone corporation established the compliance subcommittee to deliberate on policies and other important related issues this subcommittee regularly
reports on the status of compliance activities and consults on compliance matters with the integrated csr enhancement committee and the board of directors

bridgestone group companies ethics and compliance program activities have also continued to develop through local training help lines and other initiatives




compliance training


one of bridgestone corporations compliance promotion efforts involves training for all employees as well as targeted training for specific levels and positions
depending on the purpose

training for all employees


bridgestone corporation administers elearning each year with the aim of introducing and instilling basic knowledge with respect to compliance in an attempt to
improve compliance knowledge and awareness in line with the job duties of each employee discussionbased training focused on compliance issues is also
conducted on an annual basis in each workplace

levelbased training


to foster a sense of ownership among managing directors general managers and plant managers as leaders of their operations and instill a strong recognition
of their roles in terms of establishing a compliance culture throughout their operations bridgestone corporation has been conducting manager and senior
manager training since 2013 in 2015 these training activities were expanded to include plant managers

in addition to the above bridgestone corporation also conducts training regularly for newly hired employees midcareer hires and newly appointed managers




compliance helplines


bridgestone corporation has created two compliance helplinesone internal and one externalto bring compliancerelated issues to light and respond to issues as
quickly as possible through internal investigations the compliance helplines ensure the confidentiality of consultations in accordance with the provisions of
inhouse helpline procedures the helplines provide the consulting employees with feedback in terms of the results of investigations and the nature of responses
while attempting to prevent any adverse consequences for raising a concern in addition reports of consultations are regularly submitted to the cco who
provides advice and takes appropriate measures to ensure the seriousness of responses in the event problems arise

to encourage employees to use the helpline we offer helpline contact information during compliance training use posters to spread compliance awareness
provide helpline contact information on the corporate intranet and share data on the number and types of cases received the compliance helplines also accept
anonymous inquiries

in 2015 the bridgestone corporation helplines received 98 cases of which 69 of calls related to understanding bridgestone policies and 19 were reported
concerns

the bridgestone group promotes the appropriate management of important risks common for the group as well as carefully crafted activities that consider the
scale and unique characteristics of each business office and subsidiary through group global unified activities and autonomous activities at divisions and sbus

in terms of unified activities we began identifying risks at the bridgestone group excluding companies in which bridgestone has an equity stake of 50 or less
in 2009

from then on we select important risks common for the group from among those identified and promotes unified groupwide countermeasures every year
these activities will continue to be conducted in 2016

at the same time to promote autonomous activities at divisions and sbus the cro was established in each division and sbu to promote detailed risk
management activities corresponding to the scale and unique characteristics of each business office and subsidiary under each division or sbu to guide these
activities risk management guidelines are disseminated within each department and sbu amid ongoing improvements to these activities

in addition the group global cro meeting attended mainly by cros from each sbu has been held annually since 2013 participants in this meeting discuss
and share information with each department and sbu with the aim of improving the level of risk management throughout the entire group




emergency responses


the bridgestone group formulates business continuity plans bcps to address important risks for the countries and regions where it operates with the aim of
ensuring a swift initial response to emergencies as well as business continuity and rapid recovery in the event of disaster

to improve bcp effectiveness since 2013 we have been promoting the creation of a structure to more effectively structure support coordination between
subsidiaries in the same region when disaster occurs in 2016 we will expand this structure to additional regions in an attempt to improve its effectiveness

at the same time in the event an emergency arises at any business office we maintain a mechanism for providing the cro with this information in a timely
manner

we are creating a structure to quickly and systematically respond in an emergency situation which will be rolled out to the entire bridgestone group




earthquake countermeasures


bridgestone and subsidiaries in japan promote bcp development and drills to prepare for major earthquakes which are a significant risk in japan

bridgestone has also established a bcp in preparation for a major earthquake in the tokyo metropolitan area that would affect our head office technical centers
and many other functions we created a three pronged office framework approach consisting of kyobashi kodaira and yokohama for emergencies ensuring
backup functions throughout emergency countermeasure organization drills are conducted in these three districts annually

in 2015 evacuation points placing the highest priority on the preservation of human life and evacuation procedures were put in place at domestic facilities at risk
in the event of a tsunami

in addition since the great hanshinawaji earthquake in 1995 bridgestone has systematically implemented
earthquakeresistance measures in buildings this is to protect the lives of each of our employees but we also believe
that protecting production facilities and other corporate assets from destruction is the basis of good corporate
management in the interest of business continuity these initiatives also go toward reducing risk to meet social
requirements

since the great east japan earthquake in 2011 we have again looked carefully into the vulnerability to disaster of
building components such as ceilings and pipes we have put in place our own standards in these regards and are
proceeding with earthquakeproofing in a wellplanned manner we are also formulating and proceeding with similar
measures at our operations overseas

development class gdc as a program for training selected personnel for these gkps

under the gdc program initially we conduct 360degree evaluations of selected members from within the group approximately 15 to 20 people per year and
recently once every two years including evaluations by supervisors colleagues and subordinates as well as selfevaluations we then prepared individual
educational plans based on the evaluation results group training concentrates on skill development and the honing of leadership skills focusing on the
behavioral characteristics the members desire by assigning people who have completed this program to management at group companies in japan and
globally we cultivate management resources with an international perspective

safety awareness


to create safe workplaces it is essential to foster safety awareness as a means of ensuring every employee adheres to
applicable standards

the bridgestone group has been conducting safety consciousness surveys since 2009 these surveys identify safety
issues at each workplace through a questionnaire that consists of about 85 questions related to the occurrence of
accidents and those results are used to make groupwide improvements in 2015 the survey was conducted at 127
group company workplaces worldwide

in addition we have implemented management activities to assist in creating safe workplaces bridgestones
management team visits work sites including those operated by group companies outside of japan to discuss the
importance of prioritizing safety over all other considerations
                                                                                                                                     safe workplace support actions

moving forward we will continue these initiatives to actively promote the bridgestone safety fundamental activities and
foster safety consciousness in the workplace



engineering initiatives


work procedures and equipment that could lead to serious injury require reliable technical
measures to prevent future incidents therefore the bridgestone group is working to lower risk by
pursuing safety from the equipment design stage and maintaining safety during equipment use
this includes store and warehouse equipment as well as production equipment these efforts
include conducting risk assessments to identify risk and establish engineering controls or work
procedures to reduce risk and potential for serious injury

during 2015 we continued to assign and train safety engineers ses as experts in equipment
safety and conduct risk assessments based on the results we are working to identify hazardous

 system management related initiatives


the majority of the bridgestone groups production work sites use a checklist to assess the status of safety and health activities including legal compliance while
working to strengthen areas needing improvement

information on industrial accidents and fires that have occurred within the group is shared along with information on the same kind of accidents at other
companies in our industry and companies at large where necessary we take measures to prevent similar accidents from occurring

we are currently encouraging the implementation and expansion of safety and health management systems in the bridgestone group by doing this we will
ensure that the bridgestone safety fundamental activities work more reliably as we promote ongoing improvement to enhance groupwide safety

 safety initiative evaluations


within the bridgestone group with the exception of some group companies checklists are used to confirm the status of training education and drill execution
work rule guide composition and abnormality data uptake and improvement action daily and regular fire equipment testing and other safety activities by
understanding the results of these evaluations and moving forward steadily with improvements we can enhance our safety hygiene and disaster preparedness
status




 disaster prevention management activities


we have created a disaster prevention global guideline based on previous incidents with primary focus on disaster prevention preparedness exercises
including incipient firefighting drills and preventative inspections including electrical wiring we will strengthen fire prevention activities and strive to create safe
and stressfree workplaces

additionally we share information on fires that occur within the group and the measures taken to prevent similar accidents

we have designated september 8 as bridgestone group disaster prevention day and all of our workplaces now conduct disaster prevention drills every year on
that day

incorporated into the programs

213 new employees took part in these in programs in 2015 with participants providing valuable feedback related to improvement in knowledge and better
understanding of acceptable practices many stated they found the programs useful to improve their job performance

in addition we conduct a survey on supplier satisfaction and confirm that fair procurement activities are being undertaken at bridgestone through the 100
supplier companies that take part

results of the 2015 survey showed that some suppliers desired more improvements in communication we also worked with an external research firm to conduct
interviews through visits to some suppliers to gain a deeper understanding of supplier opinions and thoughts in light of the survey results we plan to continue
training employees in procurement departments to improve our efforts in this area

 initiatives designed to increase customer satisfaction


to help improve customer satisfaction the bridgestone group has implemented a cycle designed to improve the quality of the products and services based on
the collection and analysis of information about customer requirements and evaluations of bridgestone products

in the tire business in addition to marketing data we collect the opinions of product users posted online as well as opinions from potential customers using the
customer communication center information monitoring system we also use the voc voice of customer management system to identify and address any
early indications from voc data by synthesizing information collected by frontline service representatives with information from the customer communication
center which is linked to the provision of highquality and attractive products and services

the voc management system has been used effectively since 2012 and we have gradually expanded the scope of information compiled in the system from the
customer communication center and online sources available for browsing by departments via our inhouse portal

since the systems renewal in 2014 relevant internal departments have been able to quickly grasp customer expected value and any changes therein
bridgestone also began training to improve employee awareness of voc to effectively utilize customer feedback captured by this system

going forward we will continue to further enhance system improvements and employee training

examples of voc used to improve bridgestone products and services


bikke2e and angelino petite e electricassisted bicycles compatible for riding with two child passengers


having improved its smalldiameter wheel bicycles and electricassisted bicycles compatible for riding with two child passengers bridgestone cycle launched
sales of the 2016 model bikke2e in december 2015 and the angelino petite e in january 2016

bicycles designed for riding with two child passengers have been well received in the market particularly smalldiameter wheel models that take into
consideration the ease of seating or removing children and a low center of gravity for riding stability to address weight issues when children are placed in the
front and rear seats furthermore these models have wide loadbearing tires and speed sensors mounted in a low position on the front wheel

a great deal of feedback from customers indicated that the railtype bicycle rack at their apartment or other parking area prevents the front wheel from fitting into
the rail makes it difficult to remove the front wheel and damages the speed sensor because it comes in contact with the rail as bridgestone cycle makes
every effort to respond to customer requests parts manufacturers were asked to further miniaturize the speed sensor and review installation methods resulting
in a speed sensor with a diameter 45 the size of conventional sensors in addition a metal cover was added to protect the underside of the speed sensor

tires were also modified resulting in the adoption of a new narrow tire 6mm narrower than conventional tires offering the same loadbearing properties and
riding stability the adoption of these newly developed narrowwidth tires and miniature speed sensors makes these bicycles compatible with most modern
railtype bicycle parking facilities alleviating the concerns of customers considering a bicycle purchase

 siphon drainage system developed to improve future maintenance and upgrade capabilities expand apartment plan variations


bridgestone collaborated with nomura real estate development co ltd and the haseko corporation to develop a siphon drainage system a drainage
system enabling flexibility in the design and placement of water supply equipment in buildings

siphon drainage systems are new narrower systems that employ siphon force a pulling force generated by falling water and drainage pipes more narrow in
diameter than conventional pipes to pull water into drainage standpipes vertical drainage pipes leading to the sewer running through each floor of a building at
the floor below conventional drainage systems depend on gradients thus drainage standpipes must be installed near water supply equipment which limits the
positioning of the water supply

siphon drainage systems facilitate designs necessitating less underfloor space than conventional drainage resulting in largersized rooms in addition drainage
standpipes can be installed in common areas of the building as water supply equipment can be positioned some distance from the drainage standpipe due to
the high water discharge resulting from the nongradient drainage pipe and siphon force as a result this improves maintenance and drainage standpipe upgrade
capabilities

in addition flexibility in the layout of water supplies is intended to enable expanded apartment plan variations this development currenty allows for kitchen

 playz px passenger car tires


to meet customer demands for safety bridgestone has attempted to improve basic performance in terms of wet braking
and handling stability

in addition to improved basic performance playz px offers new fatiguefree safety performance in a product that
will provide even greater customer satisfaction

when driving bumps and dips on the road may cause the vehicle to move left and right resulting in the driver
unconsciously making minute adjustments with the steering wheel these unconscious minute adjustments can add up
to driver stress one factor that leads to driver fatigue

playz px series tires are shaped differently on the inside and outside bridgestones proprietary asymmetrically                                       playz px
shaped tires suppress play in the steering wheel while driving as a result contact with the road surface is stabilized
and the unconscious buildup of stress while driving is lessened by reducing the need for minute steering wheel
adjustments modifying the steering angle which contributes to even greater safety through the realization of
fatiguefree driving

these tires also utilize power tread rubber a new compound recently developed using bridgestones proprietary nano
protech materials technology this development successfully realizes steady traction on wet road surfaces without
sacrificing fuel efficiency and enhances resistance to rubber abrasion additionally new tread patterns were specially
designed for each type of vehicle from sedans and coupes to minivans light vehicles and compact cars enabling these
tires to be used longer compared to standard bridgestone tires ecopia ex20 series

through improved basic performance and the new safety performance of fatiguefree tires bridgestone will continue
to respond to customer needs and contribute to the realization of a safer and more comfortable mobile society

 the effectiveness of fatiguefree tires on driving was confirmed under the supervision of yasue mitsukura associate professor keio university
  faculty of science and technology a leading figure in brainwabe signal analysis

wings of dream project


as a part of our reconstruction assistance for the disasterstricken areas bridgestone has supported the wings of
dream project since 2011 operated primarily by the tokyobased ochanomizu academic association npo and
student volunteer teams the project provides support for children who lost their guardians in the great east japan
earthquake the initiative aims to create opportunities for children to make friends and grow independently while
sharing and experiencing activities such as sports and facility tours during overnight camping trips

in 2015 about 90 children participated in cultural exchange events held in the spring and autumn as well as camps
held in the summer and winter hosted at the bridgestone recreation facility in ome tokyo

reconstruction support menu and sales events


in an effort to help industries in tohoku recover from the effects of the great east japan earthquake in 2014 we began
offering a reconstruction support menu at our employee cafeteria featuring food products from the tohoku region we
also planned and held sales events featuring tohoku products

in 2015 a project offering reconstruction support menus was undertaken in employee cafeterias at all work facilities

 bridgestone continues to develop and sell the elastomeric isolation bearings used in seismically isolated structures
 that are highly safe for the people and property inside the building and for the building itself elastomeric isolation
 bearings are created by rubber and metal formed into layers and installed between the ground and the building
 normally the bearing functions to support the weight of the building when the earthquake hits the building the
 elastomeric isolation bearings function to absorb and reduce the shaking

 bridgestone has developed japans largest elastomeric isolation bearings for construction hereinafter
 elastomeric isolation bearings which are designed for buildings up to around 150 meters tall approximately 40
 stories conventional products are capable of bearing pillar loads of 3000 tons which places design limits on the
 number and placement of pillars in buildings particularly those in the superhighrise 150meter class bridgestone
 has succeeded in developing an even larger product capable of bearing pillar loads of 3800 tons allowing an
 unpreceded level of design freedom

 bridgestone uses testing machines to inspect all elastomeric isolation bearings prior to shipment but because the
 size of the recently developed bearings exceeded the capacity of its current testing machines we have installed an
 ultralarge machine at the yokohama plant this new machine is capable of bearing loads up to 5000 tons
 bridgestone aims to further increase the quality of its products and is actively promoting the use of elastomeric
 isolation bearings to protect buildings and the property and lives within them supporting the safety and peace of
 mind of its customers

  according to bridgestones research on elastomeric isolation bearings as of december 16 2014
