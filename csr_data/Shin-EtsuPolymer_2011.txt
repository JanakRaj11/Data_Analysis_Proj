     by one the subjects of the surveys are not only our group
     companies but also suppliers so a challenge is promoting
     management systems at suppliers
     koyama previously information only meant paper media but
     now we have not only electronic information on usb memory and
     pcs but also samples jigs and other material produced using
     customer confidential information we share such information
     with suppliers but as the products of our division use many parts
     for assembly we must manage multiple suppliers as overseas            process of individual suppliers we also have them respond to
     suppliers are increasing i think we must give consideration to         survey sheets in addition for fujitsu customer information is
     control by divisions and also a corporatewide management               the most important information so the handling of it is a critical
     system                                                                 checkpoint
     agawa      thats true information management including               hara     i see another challenge of ours is that we havent been
     suppliers leaves things out of our reach                               able to give the widest possible publicity to which is priority
     koyama in commercializing technologies we must think about             confidential information and which is not and narrow down
     suppliers flexibly even if suppliers understand the significance of    the information to be protected if we restrict everything it may
     information management it is difficult to require them to build an     become too difficult to work smoothly
     expensive mechanism                                                    terashima      as mr koyama mentioned samples and private
     kawamura       how about agreements                                    information are both information we must identify the information
     koyama regardless of nationalities and employment styles we            to be controlled before it becomes accessible in the market and
     must prepare agreements on information security but it cannot          we must give different handling to information which is important
     be said it is thoroughly implemented however if any information       and which is not
     leakage occurs a similar product may be marketed overseas              kawamura       listening to you is the most important thing for
     quicker than ours                                                      fujitsu private information for us information we get from
     hirose    it is associated with intellectual properties                customers is the most important
     kawamura       there are so many challenges to handle how do           minabe     yes when we take pictures of products people in
     you address this at fujitsu                                            charge tell us dont take a shot of this their level of awareness
     hirose    the fujitsu group audits about 170 suppliers through          seems to be comparatively high
     multiple procurement departments                                       hirose     in the case of a specific product or project only
     hara     how do you choose which suppliers to audit                    limited departments and members deal with it if that is the
     hirose    as we cannot visit every supplier we mainly visit major      case we must set up detailed rules of information operation in
     companies in the software field                                        consideration of business discussions and practice by project
     minabe     do you conduct on site audits                               mustnt we i think it is effective to establish a set of corporate
     hirose    we actually visit companies and audit their plants at        wide rules as a template and customize it to individual operations
     present awareness of information security management is high           within its framework
     in society and the standard of individual company activities has
     been getting higher and higher                                         handling of information by individuals
     hara     how do you instruct your suppliers                            and the importance of the widest possible
     hirose    of course they must strictly observe confidential
                                                                             publicity
     obligations in terms of the contract but the premise is that they
     appoint the person in charge and build a security management            minabe     so the methods of information management by
     mechanism such as reporting and monitoring they then                   those who handle it is questioned we use usb memories with

information security management
trust in corporations strengthened by wellestablished information management systems


so far but such accidents as forgetting pcs and loss of usb          information and the time frame for example some information
memories have occurred the biggest concern is for pcs                may become nonconfidential when a certain period of time has
that have much more information than paper documents still          elapsed in order to truly penetrate awareness among employees
awareness of people who handle them is not high                      such judgment is important
hirose awarenessraising is essential even if the company has
rules it will be a risk when some of its members dont follow the    make more detailed mechanisms on site
rules for this reason each employee of our company submits          after building the general organization
a written pledge to the company if you are ever involved in a
                                                                      and rules
situation where the operation of your department or section is
interrupted when an incident occurred you will be afraid of taking   hirose shinetsu polymer has established a mechanism
information with you                                                 and addressed such important items as awarenessraising for
agawa it is true that once you experience an incident                individuals and how to change it through elearning kawaraban
awareness will be raised to share such cases we publish them in     and other means however operation methods differ at individual
kawaraban internal information communication tool                  departments so i want managers and leaders to customize
moderator in terms of education what kind of initiatives do you      individual methods to meet the reality of sites i think it is important
take                                                                 to decide how to actually put them into practice
agawa following the establishment of rules we started                hara i agree i think we must give emphasis to and prioritize
information security education in 2005 and in 2006 2008             information and flexibly put it into practice by project
and 2009 information security secretariat members visited            kawamura first we need analysis each department has
individual plants and conducted group training using dvds and         strengths and weak points so regarding information security each
other materials however to cover all employees including those      department must make its own rules awareness raising of leaders
overseas we introduced elearning last year                         is also important in order to raise individual awareness of general
hara what is pointed out at customers audit is to grasp who          risk management leaders will be the key persons
havent been educated not who have been educated for this           terashima in our company when an incident becomes a
reason as we cannot fully grasp such data at group education we     concern internal media covers it and we also have a monthly
switched to elearning                                               security check day the person responsible for the department
terashima       we also use elearning determining whether all       makes it known to everyone and managers check the security
employees have taken the course or not is managed by the              setup of laptop pcs of individual employees
manager of each department                                           kawamura the point is to check it on site
agawa with elearning we can check those absentees as                moderator to conclude the meeting please tell us about the
data and choose languages this year we held elearning in          future outlook
three languages as we can also analyze results it is now easier     hara as a tool to communicate information to suppliers email
to improve on we will continue to host this and improve it going     is too risky so we want to introduce online storage using cloud
forward                                                              computing in relation to usb memories which are a concern we
minabe have you conducted the course for temporary workers           want to employ ones with functions to enable administrators to
too                                                                  browse its use log when it is connected to a network
agawa though some of them were trained in group sessions             kawamura information security is part of the foundation of
temporary employees and subcontractors are subject to the            management and information leakage will damage customer
training as long as they are in japan at overseas sites pcs to      trust by not only making good products but also protecting
cover all employees may not be available so we asked managers        information we hope to strengthen this trust to achieve this we
to choose who took the course                                        should not rely on sales departments but all departments must
moderator what lesson have your learned from hosting                  collaborate with each other in the future i think it is necessary to
education so far                                                     conduct education by department in particular those responsible
agawa subsidiaries individual manufacturing companies have          for procurement at individual divisions and plants must focus on
a stronger level of security than us                                 information management with suppliers and study the possibilities
koyama awareness is especially high in manufacturing                  of onsite audits and other countermeasures
departments headquarters have a wide variety of information to       it was a pleasure to listen to these precious ideas of fujitsu and
handle while suppliers dont belong to the group so we need to      we want to promote our information security management by
have a different response for them                                   taking advantage of them thank you very much
hirose i think it is good to do lifecycle management to determine     hirose we want to proceed with information security
the status where information can be disposed of not to mention       management as a partner to mutually reduce risks with your
education and management structure                                   company we would appreciate your continued patronage and

   fumig ating yashima yosaku sheet



   first in the industry folding fumigating
   unique product from opinions in the field
   the fumigating sheet protects forests against damage
   caused by pine weevils responding to opinions in the
   field our group developed the first folding fumigating
   sheet in the industr y we inter viewed mr kohama
   who was involved in its planning and development


                                                                                 fumigating yashima

   parasites b mucronatus mamiya et enda that uses pine weevils               work with yashima industry which has the numberone share in
   as media have killed many pines when looking at the transition of            chemicals currently sumikagreen co ltd and found out such
   damage in the past ten years the number peaked to 112 million               dissatisfaction about the existing fumigating sheets as length
   square meters in 1994 and decreased year by year but the                    weight and the want to use both hands
   damaged areas expanded from the south to the north still reaching                 conventionally mainstream fumigating sheets were rolls on
   630000 square meters of forest as of 2008                                   which a fourmeterwidth sheet folded in half was wound for this
        forestry business operators including forest owners                    reason entering the forest workers were forced to bear twometer
   cooperatives prevent damage by spraying chemicals or injecting                long rolls on their shoulders which was a great physical burden and
   the trunks and damaged pines are incinerated crushed or cut                led to poor operational efficiency
   down for fumigation fumigation is a treatment to cover damaged
   trees with sheets and diffuses a gas of highly volatile fumigating            responding to opinions
   solutions to kill the pest polyethylenebased fumigating sheets were         from the field with original ideas
   mainstream until around 2004 but due to needs for ecofriendly
   products by customers biodegradable sheets are mainly used now              to solve these challenges regarding length we thought about
        competition is tough in the fumigating sheet market and even            folding the sheet instead of using rolls we employed a gazette
   after switching to biodegradable sheets it was critical to differentiate      folding to gatefold the ends reducing the width from four to one
   our products from those of competitors as a market survey to                 meter and then by further folding the onemeter in half we were
                                                                                 able to fold the sheet into a 50centimeter square by changing
                                                                                 the specification we eliminated paper pipes and thus made pallet

knowing much about the companies in the industrial park as we
wanted to increase future career options we planned and started
an annual factory tour in relation to the scholarship system different
students received money in junior and senior high school making

         review of emergency measures 
        with the great hanshinawaji earthquake of 1995 as a turning point we started to prepare and improve
        the crisis management system by for example creating an emergency manual and began initiatives
        to create bcm however with the great east japan earthquake where situations beyond assumptions
        continued to occur we identified defects such as prior disaster prevention like measures for preventing
        bookshelves from falling down securing communication means between sites and emergency
        responses for this reason we reviewed the emergency manual and renewed it as disaster manual in
        order to minimize damage and early restoration of operations the manual stipulates the basic concept
        of disaster measures and emergency organization of our group based on this manual each site takes
                                                                                                                   the summer issue of the inhouse magazine

          1 global development of csr management
          to realize a sustainable society value chainbased csr                    use of biodiversity to the basic environmental policy site use
          management is essential so optimal management is to be                     conditions water resource use status and other information about
          conducted throughout the product lifecycle the same groups               production plants have been disclosed this marks a drastic step
          strategy toward this challenge has been realized as its global             in information disclosure but the issue of biodiversity includes
          environment communication system and it can also be said                  not only the conservation of biodiversity but also fair distribution
          that this is organized as a system that can be applied to csr              of profit coming from the sustainable use of ecosystem services
          procurement including human rights and labor                              and use of generic resources for this reason risk assessment of
               in consolidated sales overseas sites account for 362              business activities in view of the entire value chain is necessary
          making it extremely difficult to establish a csr procurement               making information disclosure a future challenge
          system to cover the entire group the fact that this has been              4 followup status
          accomplished early on is a very positive point for evaluation             i have seen improvements in falling trends in the employment rate
          it is expected that the effectiveness of the system is regularly           of impaired persons and the rate of paid holidays being taken
          reviewed and leads to continuous improvement in the future                which i pointed out last year it seems however that little progress
          2 review of bcp                                                           is seen in employment information disclosure on a global basis
          in relation to the impact of the great east japan earthquake              this issue features csr management at the production base in
          the review of bcp has been reported the same group did                    indonesia but as detailed economic contributions to the local
          not experience any notable damage to its procurement and                   community is reported here it seems quite possible to globalize
          production system but based on this the review of bcp has                the reports of organizations studies toward complete consolidated
          been discussed including emergency measures at the time of a               disclosure are expected including the integration of domestic and
          disaster and supply chain which suggests the healthy function of          international environmental data separately disclosed
          the pdca of the same group i highly value such improvements                    as far as seen from the data the midterm targets of energy
          that give stakeholders a sense of safety as sincere response               saving on the basic unit basis appear to be difficult to achieve
          of the same group that includes not only compliance with laws              but in order to eliminate the impact of financial results as its
          and regulations but also respect of social value and ethics in its         cause i think it should be studied to change the standard of
          concept of compliance                                                     basic unit calculation from production amount to production
          3 risk assessment of biodiversity and information disclosure              quantity i hope that information disclosure will be easier to
          following the addition of the conservation and sustainable                 understand and compare
