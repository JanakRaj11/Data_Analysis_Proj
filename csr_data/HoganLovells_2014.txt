                                    introduction
                                    good citizenship is one of our core values it means working with local
                                    and global communities to influence change for the better ensuring a
                                    diverse workforce that is inclusive and welcoming and acknowledging
                                    our responsibility for environmental sustainability since stepping into our
                                    roles as coceos in 2010 we have seen enormous strides in the area of
                                    citizenship across all our offices the launch of our new luxembourg and
                                    johannesburg offices in the last year has meant that our citizenship reach
                                    extends further than ever before we now cover five continents all of
                                    which have distinct needs in terms of social injustice diversity
                                    environment and community action

                                    our pro bono work has gone from strength to strength with more people
                                    and offices becoming involved than ever before and the fundraising
                                    efforts of all our offices have been matched only by the enormous
                                    enthusiasm with which the money has been raised  through ballroom
                                    dancing competitions lego tower building running cycling bowling
                                    and baking to name but a few of our fundraising events

                                    diversity remains a priority for us with full focus being given to ensuring

                                    unprecedented ways and numbers engaging with children and young
                                    people the elderly and homeless and socially disadvantaged people
                                    who can benefit from the skills we so often take for granted in our daily
                                    working lives and last but by no means least we continue to monitor
                                    and reduce our impact on the environment

                                    this year we have elected to send a shorter report than in previous years
                                    for a more fulsome and uptodate description of our citizenship activities
