fraunhofer umsicht has existed in oberhausen for the past 26 years we would like to pick
up on the rooting of the institute in the cradle of the ruhr industry in the heart of the ruhr
region and our connection to the city in the illustrations in our sustainability report this is why
all of the photos used in this report  with the exception of the photos of our institute branch
in sulzbachrosenberg  show scenes from oberhausen or the local ruhr region they were
either taken by employees of the institute or by their friends and acquaintances

dear readers


we are delighted that you are currently reading the fifth sustainability report which was once again created according to the
g4 standard from the global reporting initiative


we strive to further strengthen our pioneering position in terms of sustainability  also because important milestones in over
coming major global challenges were achieved in 2015 the un summit in new york resulted in the adoption of the agenda
2030 for sustainable development of which the 17 sustainable development goals link the principle of sustainability to
economic ecological and social development following on from the kyoto protocol a global climate agreement was concluded
in paris in the paris agreement the countries set themselves the aim among other things of limiting the global temperature
increase to 15c where possible and promoting climate resilience


both initiatives are very ambitious  their realization can only succeed if everyone works on them together as a research
institute we consider ourselves particularly committed to this this view is shared by the people who recommended in our
second stakeholder dialog that we should assume a position be a pioneer for sustainable development exhibit research
responsibility and academic excellence and highlight the importance of the institute for the region these recommendations are
prudent  just like our institute we have been diverse and multifaceted ever since we were founded in 1990 as a trailblazer
in sustainable energy and raw materials management we are convinced that above all the diverse nature of our knowledge
and our experiences are of benefit this opens up numerous opportunities for researching and developing innovative products
processes and services


we invite you to better get to know the diversity of fraunhofer umsicht and some of our contributions to sustainable develop
ment and hope you find this report an interesting read


best regards

feedback on the previous report and amendments
our commitment to sustainability is open to continuous              goals to reduce energy consumption were demanded
improvement we thus requested feedback on the previous             however our energy consumption continues to depend
report among others from cooperation partners and                   significantly on our rd activities which is why we are
renowned institutions who are experts in sustainability             unable to set specific goals for instance the lighthouse
management themselves we are delighted that our request             project electricity as a resource is currently working on
was willingly accommodated and we have received valuable             developing new electrosynthesis processes to use excess
input with a great depth of detail and numerous constructive         electricity from renewable energy sources in a sensible
suggestions on the basis of this feedback we have made the         way this requires increased electricity consumption for our
