chief executives report and review of operations

1   results

     the results for the year were as expected with a loss from continuing operations of r457456 sales were down to
     r13249424 2012 r15544144 due to the adverse market conditions and the fact that existing metering products
     are at the end of their life cycle design and development is underway on a range of new and exiting products this trend
     will continue until the beginning of 2014 when we expect sales to again pick up due to the introduction of a new range
     of improved metering products

2   continuing operations

     the sames icdc business is still operating proﬁtably the transfer of manufacturing operations to china has been
     very successful product development is proceeding well and the ﬁrst new products are scheduled for completion in
     2014 new products will be on a 5 micron platform as opposed to the current 2 micron platform these developments
     will bring substantial cost savings and allow the company to regain its cost and technology competitiveness

3   discontinued operations

     the old sames manufacturing facility has now been completely closed down and the remaining plant has been
     removed and sold the building is now virtually empty operating losses have been eliminated and the remaining
     property costs are now being covered by the icdc division a tenant has been found for the second ﬂoor and further
     tenants are being sourced a renovationrefurbishment programme has commenced the company itself has no further
     use for the building sames will occupy less than 10 of the property and it is proposed that the building be sold

4   rights issue

     a rights issue is underway in order to capitalise the company for growth and to allow existing shareholders to participate
     in future prospects at a favourable price a combined circular for the rights issue and the sale of the property is being
     prepared by arcay the companys sponsors

5   global emerging markets gem funding

     gem an alternative investment group that manages a diverse set of investment vehicles focused on emerging markets
     across the world has conﬁrmed that equity funding of up to 100 million for suitable investments is still available to
     labat in order to fund future acquisitions and suitable transactions we are considering various opportunities
     particularly in the gas and energy ﬁeld

6   properties

     the company is still seeking to make acquisitions in the bee ofﬁce letting property space the sames property in
     koedoespoort has proven unsuitable for an api facility and the board has decided that it should be disposed of with
     proceeds being used to strengthen the companys liquidity position and eliminate all remaining debt

7   pharmaceuticals

     discussions are taking place with the free state development corporation and identiﬁed partners to move the
     pharmaceutical api business opportunity to the new development node in harrismith

8   oil and gas opportunities

     shareholders were advised on a sens announcement dated 21 june 2013 that the company is negotiating to acquire
     three offshore oilgas licences in namibia these negotiations are continuing additionally discussions are taking
     place with a view to acquiring sa based oil and gas concessions with exciting development potential

9   strategy forward

     after capitalising the business properly for growth it is the intention of the board to grow the existing sames business
     aggressively and to seek out suitable acquisition targets

10 going concern

     the board of directors is of the opinion that having regard to the future strategy of the group the group has sufﬁcient
     resources to continue as a going concern




                                                                                  2

                                                chief executives report and review of
                                                           operations cont


    the shortfall amounting to r207 million in the net current liability position is mitigated by the following signiﬁcant
    factors as at the period end

    a   shareholders loans of r 7 751 022 have been subordinated and are not considered to be current liabilities
         the shareholders concerned are considering the introduction of these loans as capital and will continue to support
         the company
    b   the other main item relates to provisions made concerning potential sars liabilities labat and sars have had
         some long outstanding issues dating back to 2003 when labats substantial tax losses were disallowed these tax
         losses were subsequently reinstated and a number of consequent tax issues are currently being resolved an
         income tax audit has been completed and no liability has been identiﬁed a vat audit is in the course of being
         ﬁnalised and substantial credits will be due to labat a ﬁnal paye settlement will then be ﬁnalised these reviews
         are expected to be ﬁnalised within the next three months the directors are of the opinion that any potential
         liabilities have been more than adequately provided for in these ﬁnancial results and in fact are of the opinion that a
         substantial credit will be received by labat particularly since no interest has been raised on the substantial credit
         balances due to the company
    c   the remaining normal creditors totaling r3341278 are more than adequately covered by the current assets of
         r7973524
    d   provisions totaling r5 847 468 relating to unpaid directors salaries will be paid by agreement when the sames
         property is sold

    the board has further decided to complete a rights issue and sell its property in koedoespoort the company sponsors
    have almost ﬁnished preparing a circular for the rights issue and the sale of the property

    the successful settlement with sars and the successful completion of the rights issue and property sale will see the
    company becoming cash positive with a surplus of current assets over current liabilities

11 changes to the board

    there where no changes to the board during the year however mr lupungela was removed from the board on 26 august
    2013

12 post balance sheet events

    shareholders are referred to note 4 of the directors report

13 dividends

    in line with group policy no dividend has been declared

14 prospects

    the recapitalisation of the business will allow labat to participate fully in various exciting opportunities which are
    available to us after going through almost four years of development work in sames we are looking forward to
    substantial growth in the next ﬁve years we are looking forward to a period of consolidation and expansion both
    through generic growth and acquisition

15 thanks

role of directors

all board members ensure that appropriate governance procedures are adhered to and there is a clear division of
responsibilities at board level to ensure a balance of power and authority so that no one individual has unfettered powers of
decision making the role of chairman and ceo are not held by the same director the chairman is an independent non
executive director board and audit committee meetings have been taking place periodically and the executive directors
manage the daily company operations with the exco meetings taking place on a monthly basis

the board is responsible for effective control over the affairs of the company including strategic and policy decisionmaking
ﬁnancial control risk management communication with stakeholders internal controls and the asset management process
although there was no speciﬁc committee tasked with identifying analysing and reporting on risk during the ﬁnancial year
this was nevertheless part of the everyday function of the directors and was managed at board level

directors are entitled in consultation with the chairman to seek independent professional advice about the affairs of the
company at the companys expense

board and board committee meetings

the board retains overall accountability for the daytoday management and strategic direction of the company as well as for
attending to relevant legislative regulatory and the best practice requirements accountability to shareholders remains
paramount in board decisions and this is balanced against the demands of the regulatory environment in which the company
operates and the concern of its other stakeholders

to assist the board in discharging its collective responsibility for corporate governance an audit committee has been
established to which certain of the boards responsibilities have been delegated

although the board delegates certain functions to the audit committee it retains ultimate responsibility for audit committee
activities

during the period under review four meetings of the board of directors were held

on the annual ﬁnancial statements

the annual ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with ifrs and are based upon appropriate accounting policies

statements however any system of internal ﬁnancial control can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss

independent auditors report

to the shareholders of labat africa limited
we have audited the consolidated and separate annual ﬁnancial statements of labat africa limited which comprise the
consolidated and separate statement of ﬁnancial position as at 28 february 2013 and the consolidated and separate statement
of comprehensive income statements of changes in equity and statement of cash ﬂows for the year then ended and a
summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies and other explanatory notes as set out on pages 20 to 59

directors responsibility for the consolidated annual financial statements

the companys directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated and separate annual
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards and requirements of the companies act
of south africa and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
and separate annual ﬁnancial statements that are free from material misstatements whether due to fraud or error

auditors responsibility

our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and separate annual ﬁnancial statements based on our audit
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing those standards require that we comply
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated and
separate annual ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement

an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated and
separate annual ﬁnancial statements the procedures selected depend on the auditors judgment including the assessment of
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and separate annual ﬁnancial statements whether due to fraud or error
in making those risk assessments the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entitys preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated and separate annual ﬁnancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal
control an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated and separate
annual ﬁnancial statements

we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion

opinion

in our opinion the consolidated and separate annual ﬁnancial statements present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated and separate ﬁnancial position of labat africa limited as at 28 february 2013 and its consolidated and
separate ﬁnancial performance and its cash ﬂows for the y ear then ended in accordance with international financial
reporting standards and in the manner required by the companies act of south africa

emphasis of matter

without qualifying our conclusion we draw attention to the going concern paragraph in note 33 to the annual ﬁnancial
statements which indicates that the group incurred a loss for the year ended 28 february 2013 of r898 929 and at that date
the groups current liabilities exceeded its current assets by r20 723 347 before the loans from shareholders amounting to
r7 751 022 which have been subordinated for the beneﬁt of other creditors to the group these conditions along with other
matters indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast doubt on the groups ability to continue as a going concern


other reports required by the companies act

as part of our audit of the consolidated and separate annual ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 28 february 2013 we
have read the directors report the audit committees report and the company secretarys certiﬁcate for the purpose of
identifying whether there are material inconsistencies between these reports and the consolidated and separate annual audited
ﬁnancial statements these reports are the responsibility of the respective preparers based on reading these reports we have
not identiﬁed material inconsistencies between these reports and the audited ﬁnancial statements however we have not
audited these reports and accordingly do not express an opinion on these reports

1   presentation of annual financial statements
     the annual ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards and the companies
     act of south africa 2008 as amended and the jse listing requirements the annual ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the
     historical cost basis except for the measurement of property plant and equipment and certain ﬁnancial instruments which is measured
     at fair value and incorporate the principal accounting policies set out below they are presented in south african rand

     these accounting policies are consistent with the previous period standards and interpretations effective from the current reporting
     period have been applied in line with the transitional provisions refer to note 121

11 consolidation

     basis of consolidation

     the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements incorporate the annual ﬁnancial statements of the company and all entities including
     special purpose entities which are controlled by the company

     control exists when the company has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from
     its activities

     the results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements from the effective date of acquisition to the
     effective date of disposal

     all intragroup transactions balances income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation

     noncontrolling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identiﬁed and recognised separately from the groups interest
     therein and are recognised within equity losses of subsidiaries attributable to noncontrolling interests are allocated to the non
     controlling interest even if this results in a debit balance being recognised for noncontrolling interest

     business combinations

     an entity shall determine whether a transaction or other event is a business combination by applying the deﬁnition in accordance with
     ifrs 3 which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business if the assets acquired are not a business the
     reporting entity shall account for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition

     the group accounts for business combinations by applying the acquisition method applying the acquisition method requires
        identifying the acquirer
        determining the acquisition date
        recognising and measuring the identiﬁable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree
         and
        recognising and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase

     the acquirer shall measure the identiﬁable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisitiondate fair values the
     consideration of the business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values of assets given liabilities incurred or assumed
     and equity instruments issued costs directly attributable to the business combination are expensed as incurred except the costs to issue
     debt which are amortised as part of the effective interest and costs to issue equity which are included in equity

     contingent consideration is included in the cost of the combination at fair value as at the date of acquisition subsequent changes to the
     assets liabilities or equity which arise as a result of the contingent consideration are not affected against goodwill unless they are valid
     measurement period adjustments

     the acquirees identiﬁable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities which meet the recognition conditions of ifrs 3 business
     combinations are recognised at their fair values at acquisition date except for noncurrent assets or disposal group that are classiﬁed as
     heldforsale in accordance with ifrs 5 noncurrent assets heldforsale and discontinued operations which are recognised at fair value
     less costs to sell

     the excess of the fair value of the net identiﬁable assets and contingent liabilities of the entity acquired over the cost of the acquisition
     results in a bargain purchase gain which is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss

     goodwill is determined as the consideration paid plus the fair value of any shareholding held prior to obtaining control plus non
     controlling interest and less the fair value of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of the acquiree

12 signiﬁcant judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty

     in preparing the annual ﬁnancial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
     represented in the annual ﬁnancial statements and related disclosures use of available information and the application of judgement is
     inherent in the formation of estimates actual results in the future could differ from these estimates which may be material to the annual
     ﬁnancial statements signiﬁcant judgements include




                                                                                        24

                                                      significant accounting policies cont


trade receivables other receivables and loans to group companies

the group assesses its trade receivables other receivables and loans to group companies for indications of impairment the impairment
for trade and other receivables is assessed for impairment on an individual debtor basis based on historical data and future factors in
determining whether an impairment loss should be recorded in the statement of comprehensive income the group makes judgements as
to whether there is objective evidence indicating a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash ﬂows from a ﬁnancial asset where
objective evidence of impairment exist future cash ﬂows expected to be collected are projected after taking into account market
conditions and credit risk proﬁle of the trade debtors and loans to group companies the present value of these cash ﬂows determined
using an appropriate discount rate is compared to the carrying amount of the trade and other receivable and loans to group companies
and if lower the trade and other receivables and loans to group companies are impaired to the present value the carrying value of trade
and other receivables and loans to group companies equals their fair value due mainly to the short term nature of these receivables


allowance for slow moving damaged and obsolete inventories

an allowance for slow moving inventory is made with reference to an inventory age analysis all inventory older than 5 years is
provided for in full as it is not deemed to be readily disposable

fair value estimation

the carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values the fair
value of ﬁnancial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ﬂows at the current market
interest rate that is available to the group for similar ﬁnancial instruments

impairment testing

the recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units and individual assets have been determined based on the higher of valueinuse
calculations and fair values less costs to sell these calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions it is reasonably possible
that the assumption may change which may then impact our estimations and may then require a material adjustment to the carrying
value of goodwill and tangible assets

the group reviews and tests the carrying value of assets when events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable in addition the group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the
accounting policy the recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units have been determined based on discounted cash ﬂow calculations

assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identiﬁable cash ﬂows are largely independent of cash ﬂows of other assets and

provisions

provisions were raised and management determined an estimate based on the information available additional disclosure of these
estimates of provisions are included in note 20  provisions

expected manner of realisation for deferred tax

deferred tax is provided for on the fair value adjustments of investment properties and land and buildings based on the expected manner
of recovery ie sale or use this manner of recovery affects the rate used to determine the deferred tax liability refer note 15  deferred
tax

taxation

judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes due to the complexity of legislation there are many transactions
and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business

the group recognises the net future tax beneﬁt related to deferred income tax assets to the extent that it is probable that the deductible
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future assessing the recoverability of deferred income tax assets requires the
group to make signiﬁcant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income estimates of future taxable income are based on
forecast cash ﬂows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction to the extent that future ca sh ﬂows and
taxable income differ signiﬁcantly from estimates the ability of the group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the end of the
reporting period could be impacted

residual values and useful life values

the useful economic lives depreciation method and residual values of items of property plant and equipment and tangible assets are
estimated annually the actual lives depreciation method and residual values may vary depending on a variety of factors and
circumstances

equity loans

repayments of loans purchased at a discount as a result of business combinations are accounted for as equity loans in the holding
company and are included in nondistributable reserves

13 property plant and equipment

    the cost of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised as an asset when
       it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the company and
       the cost of the item can be measured reliably

    property comprises land and buildings held by the group for manufacturing and administration purposes the directors review the fair
    value of property with reference to the last revaluation performed by professional valuers and the income generating capacity of the
    property any revaluation is credited to other comprehensive income except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease for the
    same asset previously recognised in proﬁt or loss in which case the increase is credited to proﬁt or loss to the extent of the decrease
    previously charged a decrease in carrying amount arising on the revaluation of such land and buildings is charged to proﬁt or loss
    freehold land with no buildings on it is not depreciated

    plant and equipment is stated in the statement of ﬁnancial position at revalued amounts being the fair value at the date of revaluation
    less any subsequent accumulated depreciation revaluations are made with sufﬁcient regularity such that the carrying amount does not
    differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the reporting date any revaluation is credited to the asset
    revaluation reserve net of deferred tax except to the extent that it reverses are valuation decrease for the same asset previously
    recognised in proﬁt or loss in which case the increase is credited to proﬁt or loss to the extent of the decrease previously charged a
    decrease in carrying amount arising on the revaluation of such plant and equipment is charged to proﬁt or loss to the extent that it
    exceeds the balance if any held in the revaluation reserve relating to a previous revaluation of that asset

    all other assets are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at their cost less any subsequent accumulated
    depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses

    historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items subsequent costs are included in the
    assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts
    associated with the item will ﬂow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably the carrying amount of the r eplaced
    part is derecognised all other repairs and maintenance are charged to proﬁt and loss during the ﬁnancial period in which the y are
    incurred

    the depreciation is calculated at rates considered appropriate to reduce the cost of the asset less residual value over their estimated
    useful life on the straight line basis

    the useful lives of items of property plant and equipment have been assessed as follows

    item                                                                       average useful life

    computer equipment                                                         35 years

    the residual value useful life and depreciation method of each asset are reviewed at the end of each reporting period if the expectations
    differ from previous estimates the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate

    each part of an item of property plant and equipment with a cost that is signiﬁcant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated
    separately

    the depreciation charge for each period is recognised in proﬁt or loss unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset

    the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property plant and equipment is included in proﬁt or loss when the item is
    derecognised the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property plant and equipment is determined as the
    difference between the net disposal proceeds if any and the carrying amount of the item

    assets which the companygroup holds for rentals to others and subsequently routinely sell as part of the ordinary course of activities
    are transferred to inventories when the rentals end and the assets are availableforsale these assets are not accounted for as noncurrent

    assets held for sale proceeds from sales of these assets are recognised as revenue all cash ﬂows on these assets are included in cash
    ﬂows from operating activities in the cash ﬂow statement

   14 intangibles

        an intangible asset is recognised when
          it is probable that the expected future economic beneﬁts that are attributable to the asset will ﬂow to the entity and
          the cost of the asset can be measured reliably

        intangibles are initially recognised at cost

        expenditure on research or on the research phase of an internal project is recognised as an expense when it is incurred

        an intangible asset arising from development or from the development phase of an internal project is recognised when
          itis technically feasible to complete the asset so that it will be available for use or sale
          there is an intention to complete and use or sell it
          there is an ability to use or sell it
          it will generate probable future economic beneﬁts
          there are available technical ﬁnancial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset
          the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably




                                                                                      26

     intangibles are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses

     the amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets are reviewed every periodend

     reassessing the useful life of an intangible asset with a ﬁnite useful life after it was classiﬁed as indeﬁnite is an indica tor that the asset
     may be impaired as a result the asset is tested for impairment and the remaining carrying amount is amortised over its useful life

     an intangible asset shall be derecognised
     a on disposal or
     b when no future economic beneﬁts are expected from its use or disposal

     the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset shall be determined as the difference between the net disposal

15 investment in subsidiaries

    in the companys separate annual ﬁnancial statements investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any accumulated impairment

    investments in subsidiaries are classiﬁed as noncurrent assets and are stated in the separate ﬁnancial statements of the company at cost
    less appropriate impairments where the value of the investment is considered to be below the carrying value and the decrease in the
    value is considered not to be of a temporary nature the investment is written down to the expected realisable value

16 financial instruments

    classiﬁcation

    the group classiﬁes ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities into the following categories
       financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss
       loans and receivables
       financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

    classiﬁcation depends on the purpose for which the ﬁnancial instruments were obtained  incurred and takes place at initial recognition
    classiﬁcation is reassessed on an annual basis except for derivatives and ﬁnancial assets designated as at fair value through proﬁt or
    loss which shall not be classiﬁed out of the fair value through proﬁt or loss category

    initial recognition and measurement

    financial instruments are recognised initially when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments

    the group classiﬁes ﬁnancial instruments or their component parts on initial recognition as a ﬁnancial asset a ﬁnancial liability or an
    equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement

    financial instruments are measured initially at fair value except for equity investments for which a fair value is not determinable which
    are measured at cost and are classiﬁed as availableforsale ﬁnancial assets

    for ﬁnancial instruments which are not at fair value through proﬁt or loss transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of
    the instrument

    transaction costs on ﬁnancial instruments at fair value through proﬁt or loss are recognised in proﬁt or loss

    subsequent measurement

    financial instruments at fair value through proﬁt or loss are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from
    changes in fair value being included in proﬁt or loss for the period

    dividend income is recognised in proﬁt or loss as part of other income when the groups right to receive payment is established

    loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less accumulated impairment
    losses

    financial liabilities at amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method

    loans to from group companies

    these include loans to and from holding companies fellow subsidiaries and subsidiaries and are recognised initially at fair value plus
    direct transaction costsand subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest method less accumulated impairment losses

    loans to group companies are classiﬁed as loans and receivables

    loans from group companies are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities measured at amortised cost

   trade and other receivables

   trade and other receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
   effective interest rate method appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in proﬁt or loss when there is
   objective evidence that the asset is impaired signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculties of the debtor probability that the debtor will enter
   bankruptcy or ﬁnancial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is
   impaired the allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of
   estimated future cash ﬂows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition

   the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in proﬁt
   or loss within operating expenses when a trade receivable is uncollectable it is written off against the allowance account for trade
   receivables subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in proﬁt or loss

   trade and other receivables are classiﬁed as loans and receivables

   trade and other payables

   trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
   interest rate method trade and other payables are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities at amortised cost

   cash and cash equivalents

   cash equivalents are short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to
   insigniﬁcant risk in change in value cash and cash equivalents are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at
   amortised cost

   bank overdraft borrowings loans to shareholders and loans payable

   bank overdrafts loans payables and borrowings are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost
   using the effective interest rate method bank overdrafts loans payable and borrowings are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities at amortised
   cost

17 tax

   current tax assets and liabilities

   current tax for current and prior periods is to the extent unpaid recognised as a liability if the amount already paid in respect of current
   and prior periods exceeds the amount due for those periods the excess is recognised as an asset

   current tax liabilities assets for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be paid torecovered from the
   tax authorities using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted byte end of the reporting period

   deferred tax assets and liabilities


   a deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences except to the extent that the deferred tax liability arises from
      the initial recognition of goodwill or
      the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which
       o     is not a business combination and
       o     at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting proﬁt nor taxable proﬁt tax loss

   a deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except to the
   extent that both of the following conditions are satisﬁed
       the parent investor is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and
       it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future

   a deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be
   available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised unless the deferred tax asset arises from the initial
   recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that
       is not a business combination and
       at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting proﬁt nor taxable proﬁt tax loss

   a deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is
   probable that
      the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and
      taxable proﬁt will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised

   a deferred tax asset is recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will
   be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised

   deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the
   liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period

   deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
   liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets
   and liabilities on a net basis

     tax expenses
     current and deferred taxes are recognised as income or an expense and included in proﬁt or loss for the period except to the extent that
     the tax arises from
          a transaction or event which is recognised in the same or a different period to other comprehensive income or
          a business combination

     current tax and deferred taxes are charged or credited to other comprehensive income if the tax relates to items that are credited or
     charged in the same or a different period to other comprehensive income

     current tax and deferred taxes are charged or credited directly to equity if the tax relates to items that are credited or charged in the
     same or a different period directly in equity

     secondary tax on companies stc is provided for at a rate of 10 on the amount by which the dividends declared by the group exceed
     the dividends received deferred taxation on unutilised stc credits is recognised to the extent that stc payable on future dividend
     payments is likely to be available for setoff stc was discontinued with effect 1 april 2012 and replaced with a dividends withholding
     tax

18 leases

     a lease is classiﬁed as a ﬁnance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership a lea se is classiﬁed
     as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership

     operating leases  lessor

     operating lease income is recognised as an income on a straightline basis over the lease term

     initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging operating leases are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and
     recognised as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income

     income for leases is disclosed under revenue in proﬁt or loss


     operating leases  lessee

     operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term except where another systematic
     basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic beneﬁts from the leased asset are consumed the difference between
     the amounts recognised as an expense and the contractual payments are recognised as an operating lease liability

19 inventories

    inventory comprising merchandise for resale is valued at the lower of cost determined on a unit cost basis and net realizable value raw
    materials consumables work in progress and ﬁnished goods are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value on a ﬁrstinﬁrst
    out basis workinprogress and ﬁnished goods include an allocation of ﬁxed direct overheads based on normal levels of capacity when
    necessary provision is made for obsolete slow moving and defective inventories

110 noncurrent assets held for sale

    the group deﬁnes a discontinued operation as a component of an entity that either has been disposed of abandoned or is the subject of
    formal plans for disposal or discontinuance or is classiﬁed as held for sale and
       represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a
        separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or
       is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale

    noncurrent assets and disposal groups are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale
    transaction rather than through continuing use this condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or
    disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition management must be committed to the sale which should be
    expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classiﬁcation

    where the sale is more than one year into the future due to circumstances beyond the groups control the costs to sell are measured at
    the present value any increase in the present value of costs to sell are recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss as a financing cost

    an impairment loss is recognised in proﬁt or loss for any initial or subsequent writedown of the asset or disposal group to fair value
    less costs to sell a gain for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell is recognised in proﬁt or loss to the extent that it
    does not exceed the cumulative impairment loss previously recognised

    noncurrent assets classiﬁed as held for sale are not depreciated

111 impairment of assets

    the group assesses at each end of the reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired if any such
    indication exists the group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset

    irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment the group also
        tests intangible assets with an indeﬁnite useful life or intangible assets not yet available for use for impairment annually by
         comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount this impairment test is performed during the annual period and at the
         same time every period
        tests goodwill acquired in a business combination for impairment annually

    if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired the recoverable amount is estimated for the individual asset if it is not possible
    to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs
    is determined

                                                                                       29

    the recoverable amount of an asset or a cashgenerating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use

    if the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable
    amount that reduction is an impairment loss

    an impairment loss of assets carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation or amortisation is recognised immediately in proﬁt or
    loss any impairment loss of a revalued asset is treated as a revaluation decrease

    goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the cashgenerating units or groups of
    cashgenerating units that are expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the combination

    an impairment loss is recognised for cashgenerating units if the recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount of the
    units the impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets of the unit in the following order
        ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cashgenerating unit and
        then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit

    an entity assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods for assets
    other than goodwill may no longer exist or may have decreased if any such indication exists the recoverable amounts of those assets
    are estimated

112 share capital and equity

    an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities

    ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity


113 share based payments

     the company issues equitysettled sharebased payments to certain suppliers for services rendered equitysettled share based payments
     are measured at fair value at the date of issue fair value is determined with reference to the fair value of the goods or services received
     or in the case of employee beneﬁts to the market price of the equity instrument the fair value determined on the grant date is expensed
     to proﬁt and loss immediately where there is no vesting period


     share incentive scheme

     the group operated a share incentive scheme under which employees had the option to purchase shares in the company shares in the
     share incentive scheme have been converted into treasury shares

114 employee beneﬁts

     shortterm employee beneﬁts

     the cost of shortterm employee beneﬁts those payable within 12 months after the service is rendered such as paid vacation leave and
     sick leave bonuses and nonmonetary beneﬁts such as medical care are recognised in the period in which the service is rendered and
     are not discounted

     the expected cost of compensated absences is recognised as an expense as the employees render services that increase their entitlement
     or in the case of nonaccumulating absences when the absence occurs

     the expected cost of proﬁt sharing and bonus payments is recognised as an expense when there is a legal or constructive obligation to
     make such payments as a result of past performance

     deﬁned contribution plans

     the company and its subsidiaries contribute to deﬁned contribution retirement plans a deﬁned contribution plan is a pension plan
     under which the group pays ﬁxed contribution into a separate fund and will have no legal or construction obligation to pay further
     contributions if the fund does not hold sufﬁcient assets to pay all employees beneﬁts relating to employee service in the cu rrent and
     prior periods

     payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt plans are charged as an expense as they fall due payments made to industry
     managed or state plans retirement beneﬁt schemes are dealt with as deﬁned contribution plans where the groups obligation u nder the
     schemes is equivalent to those arising in a deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt plan

115 provisions and contingencies

     provisions are recognised when
        the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event
        it is probable that an outﬂow of resources embodying economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation and
        a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation

     the amount of a provision is the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation where some or all of
     the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed by another party the reimbursement shall be recognised
     when and only when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the entity settles the obligation the reimbursement
     shall be treated as a separate asset the amount recognised for the reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of the provision

     provisions are not recognised for future operating losses

     if an entity has a contract that is onerous the present obligation under the contract shall be recognised and measured as a provision
     after their initial recognition contingent liabilities recognised in business combinations that are recognised separately are subsequently
     measured at the higher of

116 revenue

     revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions have been satisﬁed
        the group has transferred to the buyer the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
        the group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control
         over the goods sold
        the amount of revenue can be measured reliably
        it is probable that the economic beneﬁts associated with the transaction will ﬂow to the group and
        the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably

     when the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated reliably revenue associated with the transaction
     is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period

     the outcome of a transaction can be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisﬁed
        the amount of revenue can be measured reliably
        it is probable that the economic beneﬁts associated with the transaction will ﬂow to the group
        the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably and
        the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably

     when the outcome of the transaction involving the rendering of services cannot be estimated reliably revenue shall be recognised only
     to the extent of the expenses recognised that are recoverable

     service revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period stage of
     completion is determined by services performed to date as a percentage of total services to be performed

     revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for goods and
     services provided in the normal course of business net of trade discounts and volume rebates and valueadded tax

     design and development services and merchandise sold
     revenue from sale of design and development services is recognised when targets agreed with customers have been met revenue from
     sale of merchandise net of returns is brought to account when delivery takes place to the customer

     interest is recognised in proﬁt or loss using the effective interest rate method

117 borrowing costs

     borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of a qualifying asset are capital ised as part of
     the cost of that asset until such time as the asset is ready for its intended use the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation is
     determined as follows
         actual borrowing costs on funds speciﬁcally borrowed for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset less any temporary
          investment of those borrowings
         weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the entity on funds generally borrowed for the purpose of obtaining a
          qualifying asset the borrowing costs capitalised do not exceed the total borrowing costs incurred

     the capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when
        expenditures for the asset have occurred
        borrowing costs have been incurred and
        activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress

     capitalisation is suspended during extended periods in which active development is interrupted

     capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are
     complete

     all other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred

118 translation of foreign currencies

    foreign currency transactions

    a foreign currency transaction is recorded on initial recognition in rands by applying to the foreign currency amount the spot
    exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction

    at the end of the reporting period
        foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate
        nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the
         date of the transaction and
        nonmonetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when
         the fair value was determined

    exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which
    they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous annual ﬁnancial statements are recognised in profit or loss in
    the period in which they arise




                                                                                           31

     component of that gain or loss is recognised to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity when a gain or loss on a non
     monetary item is recognised in proﬁt or loss any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in proﬁt or loss

     cash ﬂows arising from transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in rands by applying to the foreign currency amount the
     exchange rate between the rand and the foreign currency at the date of the cash ﬂow


119 statement of cash flows

     the statement of cash ﬂows is prepared on the direct method

120 treasury shares

     where subsidiaries hold shares in the holding companys share capital the consideration paid to acquire these shares including any
     attributable incremental external costs is deducted from total shareholders equity as treasury shares where such shares are
     subsequently sold or reissued the cost of those shares is derecognised and any realised gains or losses are included in the statement of
     change in equity shares issued to or held by share incentive plans within the group are treated as treasury shares until such time when
     participants pay for and take delivery of such shares the same applies to treasury shares held by joint ventures


121 new standards and interpretations

1211 standards and interpretations effective and adopted in the current year

ifrs 1 firsttime adoption of international financial reporting standards

amendment clariﬁes those changes in accounting policies in the year of adoption which fall outside of the scope of ias 8amendment
permits the use of revaluation carried out after the date of transition as a basis for deemed cost amendment permits the use of carrying
amount under previous gaap as deemed cost for operations subject to rate regulation the standard was amended to provide guidance for
entities emerging from severe hyperinﬂation and resuming presentation of ifrs compliant ﬁnancial statements or presenting ifrs
complaint ﬁnancial statements for the ﬁrst time

the standard was amended to remove the ﬁxed date of 1 january 2004 relating to the retrospective application of the derecognition
requirements of ias 39 and relief for ﬁrsttime adopters from calculating day 1 gains on transactions that as the group has previously
adopted ifrs the amendments will have no impact on the group

the group had no business combinations during the year therefore the adoption of these amendments had no impact on the group

ifrs 7 financial instruments disclosures

from ﬁnancial instruments and removed some disclosure items which were seen to be superﬂuous or misleading further amendments require
additional disclosure on transfer transactions of ﬁnancial assets including the possible effects of any residual risks that the transferring entity
retains

the amendments also require additional disclosures if a disproportionate amount of transfer transactions are undertaken around the end of a
reporting period the adoption had no impact on the group

ifric 13 customer loyalty programmes

clariﬁcation on the intended meaning of the term fair value in respect of award credits has been provided the group does not have any
customer loyalty programmes and therefore the adoption had no impact

01 march 2013 or later periods

ifrs 1  annual improvements for 2009  2011 cycle

ifrs 9 financial instruments

this new standard is the ﬁrst phase of a three phase project to replace ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement to date
the standard includes chapters for classiﬁcation measurement and derecognition of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities the following are main
changes from ias 39
    financial assets will be categorised as those subsequently measured at fair value or at amortised cost
    financial assets at amortised cost are those ﬁnancial assets where the business model for managing the assets is to hold the assets to
     collect contractual cash ﬂows where the contractual cash ﬂows represent payments of principal and interest only all other ﬁnancial
     assets are to be subsequently measured at fair value
    under certain circumstances ﬁnancial assets may be designated as at fair value
    for hybrid contracts where the host contract is an asset within the scope of ifrs 9 then the whole instrument is classiﬁed in
     accordance with ifrs 9 without separation of the embedded derivative in other circumstances the provisions of ias 39 still apply
    voluntary reclassiﬁcation of ﬁnancial assets is prohibited financial assets shall be reclassiﬁed if the entity changes its business model
     for the management of ﬁnancial assets in such circumstances reclassiﬁcation takes place prospectively from the beginning of the first
     reporting period after the date of change of the business model
    financial liabilities shall not be reclassiﬁed
    investments in equity instruments may be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income when such an election is made
     it may not subsequently be revoked and gains or losses accumulated in equity are not recycled to proﬁt or loss on derecognition of the
     investment the election may be made per individual investment
    ifrs 9 does not allow for investments in equity instruments to be measured at cost
    the classiﬁcation categories for ﬁnancial liabilities remains unchanged however where a ﬁnancial liability is designated a s at fair
     value through proﬁt or loss the change in fair value attributable to changes in the liabilities credit risk shall be presented in other
     comprehensive income this excludes situations where such presentation will create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in which case
     the full fair value adjustment shall be recognised in proﬁt or loss

the effective date of the standard is for years beginning on or after 01 january 2015

the group expects to adopt the standard for the ﬁrst time in the 2016 annual ﬁnancial statements

     revaluations

     the effective date of the revaluations was 15 may 2010 revaluations were performed by independent valuer tlp kruger who is not
     connected to the group at 28 february 2013 the directors reviewed the valuation and there was no material indications that the value
     of the property differed to the previous period

     these assumptions were based on the following market conditions

     1      fair value is based on proﬁts from estimated rental income the value was calculated through applying an estimated 5 vacancy
             factor in conjunction with an expected expenditure of 20 over the annualised rental income
     2      fair market value of similar properties in the region was utilised to determine the estimated rental income
     3      capitalisation rate within valuations estimated to be 12 per annum a capitalisation rate based on a pretax risk free rate
             obtained from bonds issued by government adjusted for a risk premium to reﬂect the associated risks of the rental market and
             speciﬁc risks related to the land and buildings rental location was used

interest rate risk
interest rate risk refers to the risk of ﬂuctuating interest rates that will have a negative ﬁnancial effect on cash outﬂows and the income
statement it is the risk that the future cash ﬂow of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in interest rat es the groups
interest rate risk mainly arises from loans to shareholders and cash and cash equivalents future changes to the prime lending rates will
have a direct impact on the future cash payments towards the settlement of the ﬁnancial obligation the risk remains unhedged at the
reporting date exposure to cash ﬂow interest rate risk on ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities is monitored on a continuous basis the group
does not carry any ﬁxed interest bearing ﬁnancial instruments and is therefore not exposed to fair value interest rate risk

deposits and cash balances attract interest at a rate that varies with prime the group policy is to manage interest cost using ﬁxed
contracted rate debts where possible

the group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income of an instantaneous increase or decrease in market interest rates on ﬁnancial instruments from the applicable
rate as at 28 february 2013 for each class of ﬁnancial instrument with all other variables remaining constant the calculations were
determined with reference to the outstanding ﬁnancial liability and ﬁnancial asset balances for the year this represents no change from
the prior period in the method and assumptions used this analysis is for illustrative purposes only and represents managements best
estimate

at 28 february 2013 if interest rates on randdenominated borrowings and bank balances held had been 1  higherlower with all
other variables held constant posttax proﬁt for the year would have been r 21 608 2012 r 38 160 lowerhigher mainly as a result
of higherlower interest expense on ﬂoating rate borrowings

credit risk
credit risk arises from trade receivables and bank balances the credit quality of customers is assessed by taking into account their
ﬁnancial position past experience and other factors individual risk limits are set internally and are regularly monitored it is the
groups policy that all customers be subjected to a credit veriﬁcation procedure before agreements are entered into in addition the
trade debtors age analysis is reviewed weekly with the intention of minimising the groups exposure to bad debts

when a customer is identiﬁed as having cash ﬂow problems the credit manager will take the following steps
 conﬁrm the situation with the customer
 advise the director of the situation during the monthly meeting at which outstanding debtors balances are reviewed
 place the customer on hold to mitigate further risks and
 issue letters of demand and decide whether to proceed with further legal action

no credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from nonperformance by
these counterparties no collateral has been provided for any of the ﬁnancial assets held by the group

the maximum exposure of ﬁnancial assets to credit risk equates to the carrying amounts as presented on the statement of financial
position the carrying amount of ﬁnancial assets that are past due at reporting date but not impaired has been disclosed in note 5 to the
annual ﬁnancial statements no other ﬁnancial assets than those disclosed in note 5 are considered to be either past due nor impaired

      constraints of the group due to these uncertainties the loans were reclassiﬁed as provisions the reclassiﬁcation had no impact on
      earnings per share or headlines earnings per share nor did it impact on the total balance of current liabilities reﬂected the effects of
      the reclassiﬁcation are as follows
