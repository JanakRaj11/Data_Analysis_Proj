rainwater harvesting area in our mysore campus



we are implementing an integrated water management
approach focused on rain water harvesting improving the
efficiency of water use and recycling all the human touch
water in our waste water treatment plants to meet our
longterm goal of becoming water sustainable
in order to reduce wasteful consumption we started a
number of initiatives this year these include recalibration
of hydro pneumatic pump controls and adding multiple
variable frequency drives vfd deployment of
sensorbased low flow faucets and shower heads and
introduction of low flow dual flush systems in water
closets all water consumed at most of our campuses is
recycled and utilized for irrigation rainwater harvesting is
now the key criteria for designing and planning of all our
large campuses as an it services company water is used
only for human sustenance and not for any production
purpose therefore we believe that our operations do not
have a significant impact on water sources the domestic
waste water generated in the campus is treated in our
waste water treatment plants the treated water quality
is monitored and meets all state pollution control board
norms we need to improve our monitoring systems to
quantify the water which is recycled
protecting and nurturing our biodiversity
all our operational sites in india are located outside
protected land or habitats our activities do not threaten
any endangered species of flora or fauna we have also
focused on preserving endangered native tree species
we have over 118000 trees above the height of 15
meters in our campuses

infosys sustainability report 200809


conclusions
in dnvs opinion the report is a fair representation of the companys sustainabilityrelated strategies management
systems and performance the report along with the referenced information in the annual report and on the
company website meets the general content and quality requirements of the gri g3 and dnv confirms that the gri
requirements for application level a have been met we have evaluated the reports adherence to the following
principles on a scale of good acceptable and needs improvement
materiality  acceptable the companys materiality process has not missed out any significant known material issues
but the process should be validated with more specific inputs for each business area to bring out material issues that
reflect short medium and long term impacts
stakeholder inclusiveness  good the companys engagement process effectively identifies the expectations of
stakeholders in several business units through different engagement channels
completeness  acceptable within the reporting boundary defined by infosys we do not believe that the report omits
relevant information that would influence stakeholder assessments or decisions or that reflect significant economic
environmental and social impacts
responsiveness  acceptable within the reporting boundary defined by infosys the expectations expressed by
stakeholders have generally been addressed through corporate policies and management systems which are reflected
in the report
reliability  acceptable the company has developed its own data management system for capturing and reporting its
sustainability performance this has enabled the company to improve the reliability of data resulting in certain
restatements for year 200708 although no systematic errors have been detected dnv has identified some manual
discrepancies on data which have subsequently been corrected
neutrality  good the company has reported sustainabilityrelated issues in a balanced manner in terms of content and
tone challenges and limitations are presented together with commitments to future improvements
opportunities for improvement
the following is an excerpt from the observations and opportunities reported back to the management of infosys
however these do not affect our conclusions on the report and they are indeed generally consistent with the
management objectives already in place
   implementation of systematic quality assurance procedures of internal data management systems will help further
    improve the reporting process by increasing the reliability of reported data
   expanding the boundary of environment health and safety performance reporting to global operations will provide
    stakeholders with a fuller picture of infosys impact in these areas
   best practices in reporting among peer organisations should be used to improve the quality of disclosures
dnvs independence
dnv was not involved in the preparation of any statements or data included in the report except for this assurance
statement dnv did not provide any services to infosys during 200809 that could conflict with the independence of
our work
dnv expressly disclaims any liability or coresponsibility for any decision a person or entity would make based on this
assurance statement
