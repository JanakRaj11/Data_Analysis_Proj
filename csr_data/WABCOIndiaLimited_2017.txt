           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017

                           to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either
                              in the principal market for the asset or liability or
                              in the absence of a principal market in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
                              the principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the company the fair value of an asset or a liability
                               is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability assuming that
                               market participants act in their economic best interest
                           a fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset takes into account a market participants ability to generate economic
                           benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use of selling it to another market participant that would use the asset
                           in its highest and best use
                           the company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate under the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available
                           to measure fair value maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs
                           all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the
                           fair value hierachy described as follows based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as
                           a whole
                            level 1 quoted unadjusted market price in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
                            level 2  valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly
                           or indirectly observable
                            level 3  valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable
                           for assets and liabilites that are recognized in the financial statements on a recurring basis the company determines whether
                           transfers have occured between levels in the hirerachy by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is
                           significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period
                           the companys management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement such as
                           investments and deposits measured at fair value and for nonrecurring measurement
                           for the purpose of fair value disclosures the company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the
                           nature characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above
                           this note summarizes accounting policy for fair value other fair value related disclosures are given in the relavant notes to
                           the financial statements
                     c revenue recognition
                         revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company and the revenue
                         can be reliably measured regardless of when the payment is being made revenue is measured at the fair value of the
                         consideration received or receivable taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties
                         collected on behalf of the government the company has concluded that it is the principal in all of its revenue arrangements
                         since it is the primary obligor in all the revenue arrangements as it has pricing latitude and is also exposed to inventory and
                         credit risks
                           in line with ind as 18 the company has assumed that recovery of excise duty flows to the company on its own account this
                           is for the reason that it is a liability of the manufacturer which forms part of the cost of production irrespective of whether the
                           goods are sold or not since the recovery of excise duty flows to the company on its own account revenue includes excise
                           duty however sales tax value added tax vat is not received by the company on its own account rather it is tax collected
                           on value added to the commodity by the seller on behalf of the government accordingly it is excluded from revenue revenue
                           recognised by the company is net of price revision and claims
                           the specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised

                           i sale of goods
                               revenue from sale of goods is recognised when all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been
                               passed to the buyer usually on delivery of the goods and collectability of resulting receivable claims on the company for
                               price revision are accounted when facts and circumstances indicate that a price reduction is probable and the amount is
                               can be reasonably estimated the claims by the company are recorded when it is accepted and it is reasonably certain
                               that the amounts will be collected

                           derecognition of intangible assets
                           an intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal gains
                           or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds
                           and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised
                           impairment of tangible and intangible assets carried at cost
                           the carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date for any indication of impairment based on internal 
                           external factors if any indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required the company estimates
                           the assets recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognized wherever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
                           recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the greater of the assets or cashgenerating units cgu recoverable value
                           and its value in use an assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cashgenerating units cgu fair value less
                           costs of disposal and its value in use in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present
                           value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to
                           the asset after impairment depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life
                           a previously recognized impairment loss is increased or reversed depending only for change in assumptions or internalexternal
                           factors however the carrying value after reversal is not increased beyond the carrying value that would have prevailed by
                           charging usual depreciation if there was no impairment

                     l   borrowing costs
                           borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial
                           period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset all other borrowing costs
                           are expensed in the period in which they occur borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in
                           connection with the borrowing of funds borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an
                           adjustment to the borrowing costs

                     m leases
                           the determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the
                           inception of the lease the arrangement is or contains a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of
                           a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets even if that right is not explicitly
                           specified in an arrangement in respect of agreements entered into by the company before the date of transition to ind as
                           the company has evaluated the transaction based on facts and conditions as at the transition date
                           company as a lessee
                           a lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease a lease that transfers substantially all the
                           risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the company is classified as a finance lease
                           finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or
                           if lower at the present value of the minimum lease payments lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and
                           reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability finance
                           charges are recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss unless they are directly attributable to qualifying
                           assets in which case they are capitalized in accordance with the companys general policy on the borrowing costs
                           a leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset however if there is no reasonable certainty that the company
                           will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of
                           the asset and the lease term
                           operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss on a straightline basis over the
                           lease term


                                                                                                                                                             69

                           in addition the company may elect to designate a debt instrument which otherwise meets amortized cost or fvtoci criteria
                           as at fvtpl however such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency
                           referred to as accounting mismatch
                           the company has not designated any debt instrument as at fvtpl
                           debt instruments included within the fvtpl category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the pl

                           derecognition
                           a financial asset or where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a company of similar financial assets is primarily
                           derecognised ie removed from the companys balance sheet when
                           the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or
                           the company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received
                           cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a passthrough arrangement and either a the company has
                           transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or b the company has neither transferred nor retained
                           substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the asset
                           when the company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a passthrough
                           arrangement it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership when it has neither
                           transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset the company
                           continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the companys continuing involvement in that case the company
                           also recognises an associated liability the transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects
                           the rights and obligations that the company has retained
                           continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original
                           carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the company could be required to repay

           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017

                           impairment of financial assets
                           in accordance with ind as 109 the company applies expected credit loss ecl model for measurement and recognition of
                           impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure
                           a   financial assets that are debt instruments and are measured at amortised cost eg loans deposits trade receivables
                                and bank balance
                           b   trade receivables
                                the company follows simplified approach for recognition of impairment loss allowance on
                                trade receivables
                                the application of simplified approach does not require the company to track changes in credit risk rather it recognises
                                impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ecls at each reporting date right from its initial recognition
                                for recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure the company determines that whether
                                there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition if credit risk has not increased significantly
                                12month ecl is used to provide for impairment loss however if credit risk has increased significantly lifetime ecl is
                                used if in a subsequent period credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase
                                in credit risk since initial recognition then the entity reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance based on 12month
                                ecl
                                lifetime ecl are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial
                                instrument the 12month ecl is a portion of the lifetime ecl which results from default events that are possible within
                                12 months after the reporting date
                                ecl is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the company in accordance with the contract
                                and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive ie all cash shortfalls discounted at the original eir when
                                estimating the cash flows an entity is required to consider
                                all contractual terms of the financial instrument including prepayment extension call and similar options over the
                                expected life of the financial instrument however in rare cases when the expected life of the financial instrument cannot
                                be estimated reliably then the entity is required to use the remaining contractual term of the financial instrument
                                cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms
                                as a practical expedient the company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its
                                trade receivables the provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade
                                receivables and is adjusted for forwardlooking estimates at every reporting date the historical observed default rates are
                                updated and changes in the forwardlooking estimates are analysed
                                ecl impairment loss allowance or reversal recognized during the period is recognized as income expense in the
                                statement of profit and loss pl this amount is reflected under the head other expenses in the pl
                                financial assets measured as at amortised cost contractual revenue receivables and lease receivables ecl is presented
                                as an allowance ie as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the balance sheet the allowance reduces
                                the net carrying amount until the asset meets writeoff criteria the company does not reduce impairment allowance from
                                the gross carrying amount
                                for assessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss the company combines financial instruments on the basis of
                                shared credit risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to enable significant
                                increases in credit risk to be identified on a timely basis
                                financial liabilities
                                initial recognition and measurement
                                financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss loans and
                                borrowings payables as appropriate

                                                                                                                                                                   73

           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017
                                all financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings and payables net of
                                directly attributable transaction costs
                                the companys financial liabilities include trade and other payables
                           subsequent measurement
                           the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described below
                           financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated
                           upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are
                           incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term
                           gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit or loss
                           financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial
                           date of recognition and only if the criteria in ind as 109 are satisfied for liabilities designated as fvtpl fair value gains
                           losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognized in oci these gains losses are not subsequently transferred
                           to pl however the company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity all other changes in fair value of such
                           liability are recognised in the statement of profit or loss the company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value
                           through profit and loss
                           derecognition
                           a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires when an
                           existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms or the terms of an
                           existing liability are substantially modified such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original
                           liability and the recognition of a new liability the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement
                           of profit or loss
                           reclassification of financial assets
                           the company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition after initial recognition no
                           reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities for financial assets which are
                           debt instruments a reclassification is made only if there is a change in the business model for managing those assets
                           changes to the business model are expected to be infrequent the companys senior management determines change in the
                           business model as a result of external or internal changes which are significant to the companys operations such changes
                           are evident to external parties a change in the business model occurs when the company either begins or ceases to perform
                           an activity that is significant to its operations if the company reclassifies financial assets it applies the reclassification
                           prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period following the change
                           in business model the company does not restate any previously recognised gains losses including impairment gains or

           30 significant accounting judgements estimates and assumptions
               the preparation of the companys financial statements requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the
               reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures and the disclosure of contingent liabilities
               uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets
               or liabilities affected in future periods
                judgements
                in the process of applying the companys accounting policies management has made the following judgements which have the most significant
                effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements
                fair value measurement of financial instruments
                when the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in
                active markets their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the dcf model the inputs to these models are taken from
                observable markets where possible but where this is not feasible a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values judgements
                include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk credit risk and volatility changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the
                reported fair value of financial instruments see note 37 for further disclosures
                estimates and assumptions
                the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of
                causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are described below the company
                based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared existing circumstances and
                assumptions about future developments however may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of
                the company such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur

                impairment of nonfinancial assets
                impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of its fair value
                less costs of disposal and its value in use the fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales
                transactions conducted at arms length for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset the
                value in use calculation is based on a dcf model the cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include
                restructuring activities that the compant is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the assets performance of the
                cgu being tested the recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the dcf model as well as the expected future cashinflows
                and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes these estimates are most relevant to goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful

                deffered income taxes
                the companys tax expense for the year is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges the calculation of the total tax expense
                necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items a deferred tax asset is recognised when it has become
                probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered recognition therefore involves judgeinent regarding the
                prudent forecasting of future taxable gains and profits of the business
                defined benefit plans
                the cost of the defined benefit plan and other postemployment benefits and the present value of the obligation are determined using actuarial
                valuations an actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future these include the
                determination of the discount rate future salary increases and mortality rates due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its longterm
                nature a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions all assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date
                further details about defined benefit obligations are given in note 32
