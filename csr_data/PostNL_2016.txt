in determining our ambition for 2020 postnl 2020 we analysed the changing world around us and how this impacts our business we
identified three key market trends which are shaping the daytoday lives of our customers and postnl we also considered the
developments within the markets in which we operate and looked at how our business is influenced by competition and regulatory
landscapes finally we looked at what we are good at our core competences these are our people networks customers knowledge

how we will achieve these ambitions

4 developing our strategy
in 2015 we introduced an updated strategy called postnl 2020 in this chapter we
explain the internal and external elements that shaped this strategy

market trends
in determining postnl 2020 we looked first at how the world around us is changing and the way it is impacting our business from this
we identified three key market trends which are shaping the daytoday lives of our customers and postnl these trends are
accelerating ecommerce technological developments and sustainable society in the following table we explain the three market
trends in more detail we then discuss the effect of each market trend on our entire business and where relevant on each business
segment




the effect of ecommerce on our business                               in the 2b parcels and the logistics markets we expect growth to
the growth in ecommerce is having a positive impact across all        be strongly linked to gdp however in specific sectors such as
our business segments for a number of years customers have            food home  garden health  personal care electronics and
increasingly been ordering online in their home markets as            fashion growth is strong and opens up a range of opportunities
ordering confidence increases customers are more frequently           consumers are demanding greater ease of use greater control
ordering from international etailers this growth in domestic and     and seamless return solutions another area driving the growth of
international ecommerce creates opportunities for our                 ecommerce is omnichannel consequently supply chains are
crossborder services domestic parcels and logistics and our mail    shifting and becoming more complex producers are not just
operations                                                            delivering to wholesalers and retailers but also directly to the end
                                                                       consumer smart stock management has become a necessity

                                                                       with wholesalers and retailers demanding stateoftheart
the increase in goods being purchased online is leading to
                                                                       warehousing spoton fulfilment and a broad range of pickup and
greater demand from retailers to send packages including those
that fit through the mail box consumers are also demanding

                                                                       international
are in transit and as the number of webshops increases
                                                                       we expect the crossborder ecommerce market to grow on
ecommerce parties also request more value added services one
example is direct marketing services as etailers bid for customer
                                                                       average by 20 percent per year between now and 2020
attention these include online and offline direct marketing           customers already used to rapidly developing service levels
services with offline remaining a very important part of the          domestically expect similar flexibility on crossborder purchases
marketing mix due to its high attention value                         examples include track  trace and greater control over delivery
                                                                       times and locations
parcels
accelerating ecommerce in our benelux home market and                 in italy the ecommerce market is less mature than the benelux
abroad is driving growth in the parcels and logistics industry in     market mainly because of lower internet penetration rates as it
the 2c parcels market we expect market revenue growth of              develops we expect good growth opportunities in the coming
between 6 percent and 8 percent on average per year until 2020        years

the effect of technology on our business                                across our networks enabling us to further improve our advanced

connected to the internet by 2020 at the same time technology         customers to select a specific twohour delivery time slot
is enabling data to be transferred into knowledge these trends
are impacting our business                                             international
                                                                        technology is impacting all our international mail markets from
for example the growth in ecommerce is being driven by the            crossborder to italy and germany for example in italy the
increasing demand of the consumer to order their goods                  government introduced compulsory electronic invoicing for
anytime anywhere anyplace and their expectation of better            public bodies on the one hand this creates opportunities in the
service at lower prices while this began with domestic                 customer communication market while for the physical mail
purchases as consumers become more familiar with online                market it can be viewed as a threat while in germany the
shopping there is a shift towards international ecommerce            government is currently working on an electronic mail solution
whether consumers receive parcels or small packages sent                called demail this solution enables members of the public
through the mail network they have evergreater expectations          agencies and businesses to exchange legal documents online
for example they expect international service levels to equal
domestic service levels by providing realtime alerts about the         the latest technological developments are also enabling new
status of their deliveries by sms or push notification they also      services and solutions to be developed within the crossborder
expect to be able to have full insight into the status of their mail    ecommerce parcels market for us this trend involves providing
or parcels using our track  trace services                           our customers with seamless return solutions where customers
                                                                        are able to return goods to retailers manufacturers and fulfilment
mail in the netherlands                                                 centres easily and reliably for example we provide international
within the communication market the growth of digital                  etailers with an it platform that gives them full control over their
alternatives remains stronger than physical mail this directly         shipments this enables them to provide their customers with
impacts physical mail volumes resulting in a decline in the            customised notification via email or on their website
transaction mail and periodicals markets within the
unaddressed mail market there is an increasing move towards            the effect of sustainable society on our business
digital alternatives with customers more frequently choosing for       we see an increased focus on sustainability amongst our
online marketing solutions                                             customers across all business segments which we translate into
                                                                        more sustainable delivery solutions we are also increasingly
to keep pace with volume decline we are utilising technology to        focusing on our place within society and the contribution we
create more effective networks for example nextgeneration            make to the community
sorting machines increase the automation of sorting processes
making them faster and more accurate while sorting machines            mail in the netherlands

highly efficient sorting and delivery centres and by focusing on
our sustainable delivery models at the same time the rise in the
collaborative economy is driving a range of new business
solutions including the need for more localtolocal purchasing

notable influx of new players

international
one of the things we focus on within international is reducing our
carbon emissions which involves switching to cleaner forms of
mail and parcels transport or migrating towards using
sustainable electricity one example can be found in our case

reduce its co2 emissions by 40 to 60 percent

competition and regulatory developments
the second element we looked into when developing postnl 2020 was the impact competition and regulatory landscapes may have
on our business each market in which we operate is impacted uniquely and we discuss these developments and how they could affect
our business segments

in 2015 revenue of parcels increased by 74 to 917 million
2014 854 mainly due to strong volume growth of domestic
and international parcels driven by continued growth in
ecommerce partly offset by a lower average price per parcel

the new sorting and delivery centres are nearly completed at
the end of 2015 18 new centres were operational and all old
distribution centres and sorting centres were closed the new
sorting and delivery programme requires an investment of
around 240 million in total in 2015 the total spent increased by
13 million to 221 million the operational efficiency of our
parcels network continued to increase due to volume growth and
the further implementation of the new sorting and delivery

     one note the policy is described in the sections note to which it relates

     this section further describes the critical accounting estimates and judgements or areas where assumptions and estimates are
     significant to the consolidated financial statements such as postemployment benefits and restructuring

     this section also explains the changes in accounting policies and disclosures resulting from new and amended accounting
     standards and interpretations whether they are effective in 2015 or later years and their impact

postnl realising our potential  15 financial statements              87

going concern
despite negative consolidated equity based on the cash flowgenerating capability of the company the current finance structure and
the companys ability to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business postnls financial statements
have been prepared assuming a going concern

in 2015 the company continued its steps towards recovery via a solid financial performance driven by further cost savings and price
increases helped by the value increase of the stake in tnt express and the increase in pension interest rates consolidated equity
attributable to the equityholders of the parent improved by 374 million to 223 million corporate equity increased by 221 million to
2204 million also net cash from operating and investing activities positively contributed 135 million to our cash flow balance

the negative consolidated equity does not impact the companys operations the timing of debt reductions access to the available
credit facility or the stock exchange listing as at 31 december 2015 the balance of cash and cash equivalents amounted to 355
million and the company has an undrawn multicurrency revolving credit facility of 400 million its financing arrangements do not
include financial covenants bond repayments are not due until 2017 the company has an investment in tnt express that can be
monetised over time and although the company remains vulnerable to interest rate changes in relation to its pension obligations it
can also benefit from an environment of increasing interest rates

the company aims to continue to improve its liquidity and solvency in the light of measures already taken or planned management is
confident it will be able to recover towards a positive consolidated equity balance

13 critical accounting estimates and judgements
the preparation of postnls consolidated financial statements in accordance with ifrs requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities it also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying postnls accounting policies

estimates assumptions and judgements are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the resulting accounting positions will by definition seldom equal the
related actual results on a continuous basis we evaluate our expectations with the actual results and include the learnings going
forward

the areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
consolidated financial statements are disclosed below

postemployment benefits
postemployment benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate
service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made the accounting requires the company
to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate the rate of benefit increases and future mortality rates changes in
these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligations funding requirements and pension cost
incurred for details of the current funded status and a sensitivity analysis with respect to defined benefit plan assumptions see note
34 to the consolidated financial statements

restructuring
restructuring charges mainly result from restructuring of our operations and overhead as a response to declining volumes in mail in the
netherlands the scope and measurement of postnls related restructuring provision depends highly on the projected cash outflows
over the future years which are mainly driven by the estimated number of staff that will either be made redundant or apply for a
mobility arrangement for details on the current restructuring provision see note 35 to the consolidated financial statements

impairment of assets
in determining impairments of intangible assets including goodwill tangible fixed assets and financial fixed assets management must
make significant judgements and estimates to determine whether the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value the
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and value in use in assessing the value in use the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the assetspecific risks determining cash flows requires the use of judgements and estimates that have been
included in postnls strategic plans and longterm forecasts the data necessary for the execution of the impairment tests are based on
management estimates of future cash flows which make it necessary to estimate revenue growth rates and profit margins

impairment of receivables
the risk of uncollectability of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with and the past due status of
doubtful debtors large accounts are assessed individually based on factors that include ability to pay bankruptcy and payment

postnl realising our potential  15 financial statements             88

history in addition debtors in certain countries are subject to a higher collectability risk which is taken into account when assessing
the overall risk of uncollectability

deferred revenue and revenue related accruals
postnl has to estimate the deferred revenues from stamps sold but not yet used by its customers the company uses a seasonal model
based on historical figures in order to account for the seasonal effects on sales from stamps for example stamp sales for christmas
greetings in november and december within the segment international revenue is for a substantial part passthrough revenue for
which the local incumbent performs the last mile activities at period ends management has to estimate the unbilled expenses and
contractually agreed discounts and rebates related to the volumes handled additionally the company handles large quantities of
international mail and parcel volumes to and from foreign postal operators although the net outstanding accrual positions reflect our
best estimate given the assumptions involved final settlements might deviate from the outstanding positions

income taxes and deferred tax assets
the company is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions significant judgement is required in determining the provision and
liability for income taxes postnl recognises liabilities for potential tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be
due based on its best interpretation of the relevant tax laws and rules postnl recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered this is based on estimates of taxable income by
jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable

contingent liabilities
legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending against the company in various jurisdictions the cases and claims often
raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues that are subject to many uncertainties and complexities including but not limited to
the facts and circumstances of each particular case and claim the jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law postnl consults
with legal counsel and certain other experts on matters related to litigation postnl recognises a liability when it is determined that an
adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated

interpretations that could have a material impact on our financial statements

      accounting policies

      accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
      interest method less allowance for impairment an allowance for impairment of accounts receivable is established when there is
      objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables
      the amount of the allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future
      cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement any reversal
      of the loss is included in the income statement on the same line as where the original expense was recorded

    acquired goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets goodwill on acquisition of joint ventures and
    associates is included in investments in associates and is not separately recognised or tested for impairment gains and losses on
    disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold

    separatelyrecognised goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to an annual impairment review goodwill is
    carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses

    other intangible fixed assets
    costs related to the development and installation of software for internal use are capitalised at historical cost and amortised over
    the estimated useful life other intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the
    acquisition date

    an asset under construction is transferred to its respective intangible asset category at the moment it is ready for use and is
    amortised using the straightline method over its estimated useful life other intangible assets are valued at the lower of historical
    cost less amortisation and impairment

based on 2015 financial performance a detailed review has been performed of the recoverable value of each cgu the recoverable
value is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal fair value less costs of disposal represents the best estimate of
the amount postnl would receive if it sold the cgu the recoverable value is determined based on the value in use the value in use has
been estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows

for both mature markets and nonmature markets the estimated future net cash flows are based on a nineyear forecast and business
plan as management considers these forecasts reliable based on past experience for markets considered nonmature no steady state
has been achieved to date the cash flow projections have been approved by management

postnl has determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for market development the
weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports the discount rate used in the cgu
valuations varies from 9 to 14 pretax

key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values for each individual cgu are the following

   maturity of the underlying market market share and volume development in order to determine the revenue mix and growth rate
   level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development taking into account the nature of the underlying costs
    and potential economies of scale
   level of capital expenditure in networkrelated assets and
   discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency and inflationrelated risks

management has carried out an impairment test for each individual cgu and concluded that the recoverable amount of the individual
cgus is higher than the carrying amount

   accounting policies

   the net defined benefit liabilityasset for all pension and other postemployment plans that qualify as defined benefit plans is
   determined by calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and deducting the fair value of the plan assets the
   resulting deficit or surplus is adjusted for any effect of limiting a net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling and for any effect of
   minimum funding requirements

   postnl uses actuarial calculations projected unit credit method to measure the obligations and the costs assumptions are
   made about financial variables such as the discount rate and the rate of benefit increases and demographic variables such as
   employee turnover and mortality the discount rate is determined by reference to market rates using highquality corporate
   bonds the assumed return on plan assets equals the discount rate applied in the calculation of the pension obligations at the
   beginning of the year

   service costs are recognised as operating expenses in the income statement gains or losses on the amendment curtailment or
   settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised as operating expenses in the income statement on the date of the
   amendment curtailment or settlement

   the net interest expenseincome on the net defined benefit liabilityasset is recognised as interest and similar expenses
   income in the income statement below operating income

   deviations between the expected and actual development of the pension obligation and plan assets resulting in actuarial gains
   and losses are recognised immediately within other comprehensive income net of tax the impact of the asset ceiling andor
   minimum funding requirements is also recognised within other comprehensive income net of tax

   pension costs for defined contribution plans are expensed in the income statement when incurred or due



postnls main dutch defined benefit average pay pension plan main plan covers the employees subject to postnls collective labour
agreement and staff with a personal labour agreement in the netherlands the main plan is externally funded in stichting
pensioenfonds postnl main fund an independent legal entity which is not owned or controlled by any other legal entity and which
falls under the regulatory supervision of de nederlandsche bank

postnl also runs a number of defined benefit transitional plans which mainly consist of a conditional pension benefit soft pension
ultimately granted and financed towards the main fund at 31 december 2020 or retirement if earlier

main developments during 2015
the pension fund for employees with a personal labour agreement postnl related participants within stichting
ondernemingspensioenfonds tnt merged with the main fund the merger is financially effective per 1 january 2015 to compensate
for the lower coverage ratio of the incoming fund postnl committed to an unconditional payment of 7 million to the main fund this
amount is added to the unconditional funding obligation of 150 million committed by postnl in 2013

following changes in the regulatory framework the execution agreement between postnl and the main fund has been adjusted the
main changes are an adjustment of the recovery period from three to five years relevant for determining the amount and term of the
topup payment obligation of postnl and the termination of the 315 million conditional budget that was earmarked to compensate
for potential discounts to the accrued pension entitlements in the period 2014  2018

postnl started the payment of the unconditional funding obligation to the main fund by a first instalment of 32 million at 31
december 2015 the outstanding funding obligation amounted to 129 million which will be paid by 4 equal instalments during the
years 2016  2019

further details of the main plan
the main plan is a defined benefit average pay scheme with a basis accrual rate of 1875 of the pensionable base and retirement age
set at 67 years the pensionable base is derived as the pensionable salary with a statutory maximum of 100000 level 2015 minus a
state pension offset

pension cash contributions are bounded by a minimum level of 215 and a maximum level of 275 of the pensionable salary base
the actuarial contributions are calculated by applying a 60month moving average pension fund discount rate the resulting
contributions are increased by 10 if the coverage ratio is below 120 and by 5 if the coverage ratio is between 120 and 130
based on the total maximum premium amount the intended pension accrual can be reduced in any year given the applicable
financing arrangements and current low interest rates it is expected that the accrual rate will be lower than the basis level of 1875
for the coming years the accrual rate for 2016 has been set at 162 of the pensionable base

in the event of a coverage deficit postnl has an obligation for topup payments of at most 125 of the funds plan obligations per
year for at most five consecutive years in determining the topup payment obligation the resilience of the pension fund will be taken
into account the requirement to supplement a deficit will be determined on the basis of the beleidsdekkingsgraad ie the 12months
average coverage ratio

by the end of 2015 the monthend coverage ratio of the main fund amounted 1060 2014 1089 including the outstanding
payment of the unconditional funding obligation of 129 million by postnl the decreased coverage ratio is mainly explained by higher
pension obligations resulting from a sectorwide change in the calculation method of the ultimate forward rate ufr and the
cancellation of the 3months average ufr partly offset by higher pension plan assets due to the funds investment return of 14 the
12months average coverage ratio amounted 1068 per 31 december 2015 2014 1118

the returns on plan assets are linked to the strategic investment policy of the main fund the overall investment strategy and exposure
includes equity derivatives to preserve part of the upward potential on equity and at the same time be protected against substantial
declines in equity valuations in addition the fund uses interest rate derivatives to reduce the net interest exposure on its assets and
liabilities the plan assets may from time to time include investments in postnls own financial instruments through indirect holdings
by mutual funds around 78 of the funds total plan assets have a quoted market price in an active market the unquoted part relates
to investments in investment funds which invest in nonlisted assets for example real estate investments and nonlisted derivatives

the actuarial gain of 121 million resulting from a change in the rate of benefit accrual follows from the maximum level of pension
cash contributions of 275 of the pensionable base given current low interest rates and the applicable financing arrangements it is
expected that the benefit accrual rate will be lower than the basis level of 1875 for the coming years

the negative adjustments of 142 million and 129 million resulted from the limitation of the main funds funded status of 142
million and the minimum funding requirement of 129 million being the outstanding unconditional funding obligation to the asset
ceiling

key assumptions
the discount rate is based on the longterm yield on high quality aarated corporate bonds taking into account the duration of the
projected pension liabilities of around 19 years the corporate bond yield information is sourced from bloomberg taking into account a
minimum outstanding amount and other defined selection criteria by applying curvefitting procedures a yield curve is generated
using the full yield curve the discounted value of the expected future benefit payments is matched with the comparable present value
when using a single discount rate

section 4 capital structure and financing costs

   in this section

   this section sets out the groups capital structure and related financing costs

   we start by exploring our net debt position the groups key measure used to evaluate total cash resources net of the current
   outstanding debt monetisation of our stake in tnt express accounted for as availableforsale financial asset serves the
   purpose of further debt reductions

   we next disclose how the group manages its financial risks postnls activities expose the company to a variety of financial risks
   such as market risks credit risk and liquidity risk postnls overall risk management programme focuses on mitigating these risks
   which arise in the normal course of business we continue with a summary of the groups financial instruments

   we conclude this section with the disclosure of our equity structure the individual components therein and an analysis of the
   movements during the year




   accounting policies

   postnl distinguishes the following categories of financial assets and liabilities

      financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
      loans and receivables
      heldtomaturity investments
      availableforsale financial assets
      financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

   management determines the classification of postnls financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition

   financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
   financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are derivatives and include the following instruments

      fair value hedges hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities of a firm commitment
      cash flow hedges hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted
       transaction or
      net investment hedges hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation

   these instruments are carried at fair value unrealised gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss if a derivative is
   designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge changes in its fair value are considered to be effective and recorded in
   a separate component in equity until the hedged item is recorded in income any portion of a change in the fair value of a
   derivative that is considered to be ineffective or is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness is immediately recorded in
   the income statement

   amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit and
   loss for example when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place however when the forecast transaction that is hedged
   results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity
   and included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability

   when a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting any
   cumulative gains or losses existing in equity at that time remain in equity until the underlying transaction is ultimately recognised
   in the income statement when an underlying transaction is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gains or losses that
   were reported in equity are immediately transferred to the income statement

   fair value measurement is based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active


postnl realising our potential  15 financial statements                     117

    markets 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly prices or indirectly derived from quoted prices
    and 3 inputs not based on observable market data valuation techniques used include the use of recent armslength
    transactions reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis

    loans and receivables
    loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
    market and for which postnl has no intention of trading loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective
    interest method

    heldtomaturity investments
    heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities which
    postnl has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity heldtomaturity investments are carried at amortised cost
    using the effective interest method

    availableforsale financial assets
    availableforsale financial assets are nonderivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in
    any of the other categories above availableforsale financial assets are carried at fair value unrealised gains and losses arising
    from changes in the fair value of availableforsale financial assets are recognised in equity when availableforsale financial
    assets are sold or impaired the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as a gain or a loss

    financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
    financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and are
    subsequently stated at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption
    value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the financial liability using the effective interest method

availableforsale financial assets 626 million 2014 445
the fair value of the 146 stake in tnt express as at 31 december 2015 amounts to 626 million and has been determined by
multiplying the closing share price of 779 on 31 december 2015 by 80386421 the total number of issued ordinary shares held by
postnl during 2015 the share price of tnt express increased from 554 on 31 december 2014 to 779 on 31 december
2015 reflecting fedex public offer of 800 per tnt express share that was announced on 7 april 2015the fair value increase of 181

43 financial risk management
postnls activities expose the company to a variety of financial risks such as interest rate risk foreign currency exchange risk credit
risk and liquidity risk all these risks arise in the normal course of business and postnl therefore uses various techniques and financial
derivatives to mitigate them

the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding postnls exposure to the financial risks described above there are
certain limitations and simplifications inherent in the analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that rates change in a
parallel fashion and instantaneously at the same time for example the impact of changes in interest on foreign exchange exposures
and vice versa is ignored in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that would normally arise from
the market shifts assumed

postnl uses derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of hedging currency and interest exposures the company enters
into contracts related to derivative financial instruments for periods commensurate with its underlying exposures and does not take
positions independent of these exposures none of these financial instruments are leveraged or used for trading purposes or to take
speculative positions

financial risk management is carried out by group treasury under policies approved by the board of management group treasury
identifies evaluates and hedges financial risks and exposures in close cooperation with operating units the board of management
provides written principles for overall risk management as well as written policies covering the financial risks periodic reporting on
financial risks is embedded in the overall risk framework and is provided to the board of management in a structural way

group treasury matches and manages the intragroup and external financial exposures although the company generally enters into
hedging arrangements and other contracts to reduce its exposures these measures may be inadequate or may subject the company to
increased operating or financing costs

interest rate risk
postnl identifies interest rate risk associated with its financial assets and borrowings virtually all debts are at fixed rates an increase in
the rate will therefore not affect the cost base as at 31 december 2015 postnls gross interestbearing borrowings including finance
lease obligations totalled 935 million 2014 1275 all at fixed interest rates financial assets are on average of a shortterm nature

at 31 december 2015 if interest rates on borrowings and financial assets had been 1 higher with other variables held constant the
profit before income tax would have been 4 million higher 2014 6 the potential profit increase is entirely attributable to interest
income on the cash and cash equivalents equity would be positively affected by 2 million 2014 5 due to the change in the interest
curve projection applied for the calculation of the fair value of the 225284 million and 89112 million as well as the 4 million
2014 6 positive impact on profit before income taxes see also note 44 to the consolidated financial statements

foreign currency exchange risk
postnl has international operations that generate foreign currency exchange risks arising from future commercial transactions
recognised assets and liabilities investments and divestments in foreign currencies other than functional currencies of the respective
business units of postnl irrespective of whether it is the euro postnls functional and reporting currency or another functional
currency for accounting purposes the european central bank is used as the source

the main currencies of postnls external hedges are the british pound hong kong dollar and us dollar

the board of management has set a policy requiring group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against the functional
currency group companies are required to hedge material exposures via the use of foreign exchange derivatives with group treasury
whereby a financing company operated by group treasury trades these foreign exchange derivatives with external banks as at 31
december 2015 postnl had no net investment hedges outstanding significant acquisitions and local debt are usually funded in the

   accounting policies

   equitysettled sharebased compensation plans
   as from 2013 postnl operates a number of equitysettled sharebased compensation plans under which the employees receive
   conditional shares of the group for services rendered the fair value of the employee services received as measured at the
   grant date in exchange for the grant of the shares is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity

   nonmarket performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of conditional shares that are
   expected to vest the total expense is recognised over the vesting period which is the period over which all the specified vesting
   conditions are to be satisfied in addition for some sharebased compensation plans employees provide services in advance of
   the grant date and therefore the grant date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense between service
   commencement date and grant date at the end of each reporting period the group revises its estimates of the number of shares
   that are expected to vest based on the nonmarket vesting conditions it recognises the impact of the revision to original
   estimates if any in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity

   cashsettled sharebased compensation plans
   postnl operates one cashsettled sharebased compensation plan involving a cash payment to employees for amounts that are
   based on the price of postnls shares equal to the gain that would have been made by exercising the notional options and
   immediately selling the shares in the market the corresponding liability for the cash settled plans is measured initially and at
   each reporting date until settled at the fair value of the rights taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the
   rights were granted and the extent to which the employees have rendered service to date any changes in fair value are
   recognised in the income statement the total expense is recognised over the vesting period which is the period over which all
   the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied

   it is a conditional equitysettled share plan based on threeyear internal targets
   shares are conditionally allocated to the board of management from 2013 onwards
   a conditional dividend equivalent is added to the conditional shares equal to the dividend rights of ordinary shares
   the conditional shares and their conditional dividend equivalents will vest after a performance period of three years
   vesting is subject to the extent to which the longterm targets have been achieved
   if a member of the board of management leaves the company during the performance period due to circumstances involving fraud or
    gross misbehaviour any accrued rights on the longterm incentive plan will terminate and become void and
   if a member of the board of management leaves the company due to other reasons a pro rata performance and timebased vesting
    applies

in compliance with the dutch corporate governance code following a threeyear performance period the retention period for vested
shares expires after two years or at termination of employment if this occurs earlier for compliance reasons a sale of shares may not
occur earlier than six months after termination of the employment any sale of shares for the purpose of using the proceeds to pay for
the tax due at vesting of these shares is exempted

postnl realising our potential  15 financial statements               130

postnl uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries the consideration of an acquisition is
measured at the fair value of the assets transferred equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of
exchange the consideration transferred also includes the fair value arising from contingent consideration arrangements identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on
the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred

the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of postnls share of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary is
recorded as goodwill if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of postnls share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired
the difference is recognised directly in the income statement

the group treats transactions with noncontrolling interests as transactions with equity owners of the group for purchases from
noncontrolling interests the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity gains or losses on disposals to noncontrolling interests are also recorded in equity

when the group ceases to have control or significant influence any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with
the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss the fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent
accounting for the retained interest as an associate joint venture or financial asset in addition any amounts previously recognised in
other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or
liabilities this may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recycled to profit or loss

the noncontrolling interest is initially measured at the proportion of the noncontrolling interest in the recognised net fair value of the
assets liabilities and contingent liabilities losses applicable to the noncontrolling interest in excess of the noncontrolling interest in
the subsidiarys equity are allocated against postnls interests except to the extent that the noncontrolling interest has a binding
obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses

functional currency and presentation currency
items included in the financial statements of each of the groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary environment
in which the entity operates the functional currency these consolidated financial statements are presented in euros which is
postnls functional and presentation currency

foreign currency transactions and balances
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the
transactions monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency using yearend exchange
rates foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and balances and
from the translation at yearend exchange rates are recognised in the income statement except for qualifying cash flow hedges and
qualifying net investment hedges that are directly recognised in other comprehensive income

foreign operations
the results and financial position of all group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows

   assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates
   income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates and
   the resulting exchange rate differences based on the different ways of translating between the balance sheet and the income
    statement are recognised as a separate component of equity translation reserve

foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings and
other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments are taken to the translation reserve when a foreign operation is
sold such exchange differences are recycled in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on the sale

impairment of goodwill
goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset might be
impaired for the purposes of assessing impairment assets are grouped at the lowest levels at which there are separately identifiable
cash flows being the cashgenerating units cgus if the recoverable value of the cgu is less than its carrying amount the impairment
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the cgu and then pro rata to other assets of the cgu
the recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and value in use in assessing the value in use the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the assetspecific risks for the purpose of assessing impairment corporate assets are allocated to specific


postnl realising our potential  15 financial statements               131

cgus before impairment testing the allocation of the corporate assets is based on the contribution of those assets to the future cash
flows of the cgu under review impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in a subsequent period

impairment of investments in joint ventures and associates
postnl assesses on each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that an investment in a joint venture or associate may
need to be impaired if the recoverable value of the investment is less than its carrying amount the carrying amount is reduced to its
recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and value in use in assessing the value
in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the assetspecific risks the fair value less costs of disposal of a joint venture or associate is
reviewed based on observable publicly available market data possible impairment charges may be reversed if there is an indication
that the impairment no longer exists or has been reduced

impairment of finitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment
at each balance sheet date postnl reviews its finitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment for an indication of
impairment if any indication exists the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated the recoverable amount is defined as the higher
of an assets fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use if the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its
carrying amount the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount any impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the income statement impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed only if there has been a change
in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised the recoverable
amount shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in previous
periods a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement

profit sharing
the company recognises a liability and an expense for profitsharing by employees based on a calculation that takes into
consideration quantitative and qualitative performance measures in accordance with contractual arrangements

dividend distribution
dividend distribution to postnls shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the year in which the dividends
are approved by the shareholders if postnl offers its shareholders the choice of dividends in additional shares the additionally
issued shares are recognised at their nominal amount

   accounting policies

   investments in subsidiaries and associated companies
   investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are stated at cost less impairment dividend income from the companys
   subsidiaries and associated companies is recognised when the right to receive payment is established

   impairment of investments in subsidiaries
   at each balance sheet date the company reviews whether there is an indication that its investments in subsidiaries might be
   impaired

   an indication may include managements downward adjustment of the strategic plan or other areas where observable data
   indicates a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows these determinations require significant judgement in
   making this judgement management evaluates among other factors the financial performance of and business outlook for its
   investments including factors such as industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing
   cash flow

   if any indication for impairment exists the recoverable amount of the investments is estimated the recoverable amount is
   defined as the higher of an investments fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use if the recoverable amount of an
   investment is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to its recoverable
   amount any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of income

   the investments fair value less costs of disposal represents the best estimate of the amount the company would receive if it sold
   its investments the fair value of each investment has been estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows
   taking into account costs of disposal the determination of the investments value in use is based on calculations using pretax
   cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a nineyear period cash flows beyond the
   nineyear period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates

   impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates or external
   market information used to determine the investments recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised the
   recoverable amount shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been
   recognised in prior years

   availableforsale financial assets
   the availableforsale financial assets of the company reflects the stake in tnt express carried at fair value unrealised gains and
   losses arising from changes in the fair value of availableforsale financial assets are recognised in equity when availableforsale
   financial assets are sold or impaired the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as a gain or a

a complete list of investments in subsidiaries associated companies and jointlycontrolled entities will be attached to the companys
annual report made available to the chamber of commerce

a detailed review has been performed of the recoverability of the mail investments the recoverable value of each investment is the
higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal the recoverable value is determined based on the value in use as this was
higher than the fair value less costs of disposal at year end 2015 the value in use has been estimated on the basis of the present value
of future cash flows for all investments the estimated future cash flows are based on a nineyear forecast and business plans as
management considers these forecasts reliable based on past experience uncertainties relating to volume decline and efficiency
measures are taken into account

the estimated future cash flows are derived from the most recent strategic planning approved by management the applied growth
rate does not exceed the longterm average growth rates on the related operation and market

the company has determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for market development
the weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports the discount rates in the
investments valuations vary from 9 to 14 pretax

key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values for the investments of the company are the following

   maturity of the underlying market market share and volume development in order to determine the revenue mix and growth rate
   level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development taking into account the nature of the underlying costs
    and potential economies of scale
   level of capital expenditure in networkrelated assets and
   discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency and inflationrelated risks

as the mail investments are vulnerable to changes in the discount rate and changes in operating income a sensitivity analysis has been
performed for the mail investments the sensitivity analysis included the impact of the following items which are considered to be most
critical when determining the recoverable value

   an increase or decrease in the discount rate of 05 and
   an increase or decrease in operating income of 5

if the discount rate were to change by 05 this would impact the mail investments by around 173 million a change in operating

section 7 other information

independent auditors report
to the general meeting and supervisory board of postnl nv

report on the financial statements 2015

our opinion
in our opinion the accompanying consolidated and corporate financial statements as set out on pages 82 to 148 give a true and fair
view of the financial position of postnl nv as at 31 december 2015 and of its result and cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the european union euifrs and with part 9 of book 2 of
the dutch civil code

what we have audited
we have audited the accompanying financial statements 2015 of postnl nv the hague the company or postnl the financial
statements include the consolidated financial statements of postnl nv and its subsidiaries together the group and the corporate
financial statements

the financial statements comprise

   the consolidated and corporate statement of financial position as at 31 december 2015
   the following statements for the year ended 31 december 2015 the consolidated and corporate income statement and the
    consolidated and corporate statements of comprehensive income changes in equity and cash flows and
   the notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information

the financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is euifrs and the relevant
provisions of part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code for the consolidated financial statements and the corporate financial statements

the basis for our opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with dutch law including the dutch standards on auditing our responsibilities under those
standards are further described in the our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report

we are independent of postnl nv in accordance with the verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij
assuranceopdrachten vio and other relevant independence requirements in the netherlands furthermore we have complied with
the verordening gedrags en beroepsregels accountants vgba

we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion

our audit approach

overview and context
we designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements in
particular we looked at where the board of management made subjective judgements for example in respect of significant accounting
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain as in all of our audits we also
addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the board
of management that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud

we ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component level included the appropriate skills and competences which are
needed for the audit of postnl we included specialists in the areas of pensions it valuations real estate and financial instruments in
our team




postnl realising our potential  15 financial statements              149

materiality
the scope of our audit is influenced by the application of materiality which is further explained in the section our responsibility for the
audit of the financial statements

we set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality these together with qualitative considerations helped us to determine the
nature timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the
effect of identified misstatements on our opinion

based on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows

overall group materiality                17 million 2014 20 million
how we determined it                     5 of operating income
rationale for benchmark                  we have applied this benchmark a generally accepted auditing practice based on our analysis of
applied                                  the common information needs of users of the accompanying financial statements on this basis we
                                         believe that operating income is an important metric for the financial performance of the company
component materiality                    to each component in our audit scope we based on our judgement allocate materiality that is less
                                         than our overall group materiality the range of materiality allocated across components was
                                         between 2 million and 5 million

we also take misstatements andor possible misstatements into account that in our judgement are material for qualitative reasons

we agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 850000 2014
1 million as well as misstatements below that amount that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons

the scope of our group audit
postnl nv is the parent company of a group of entities the financial information of this group is included in the financial statements
of postnl nv

the group audit focused on the significant components of postnl nv within the segments mail in the netherlands parcels and
international germany italy and the uk due to their significance andor risk characteristics each of these components required an
audit of their complete financial information for components within the segments mail in the netherlands and parcels the group
engagement team performed the work for components in italy and the uk we used component auditors from our pwc network firms
who are familiar with the local laws and regulations to perform the audit work for the component germany where appropriate we
used the audit procedures performed by internal audit and additionally we performed independent audit procedures we have
assessed the objectivity competence and quality control procedures of internal audit based on specific risks we selected certain
account balances to perform audit procedures within nonsignificant components

in total in performing these procedures we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items

total assets                             79
revenue                                  88
operating income                         85




postnl realising our potential  15 financial statements                  150

none of the remaining components represented more than 2 of total group revenue for those remaining components we
performed amongst others analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of material
misstatements within those components

where the work was performed by component auditors we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work
to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements as a whole the group engagement team visits the component teams on a yearly basis the group engagement
team conducted visits in germany postcon italy nexive and the uk whistl given the significance of these operations for the group
and the sale of the uk activities during the financial year the group consolidation financial statement disclosures and a number of
complex items are audited by the group engagement team at the head office these include amongst others impairment analysis
accounting of financial instruments pension accounting the restructuring provisions and accounting for the sale of whistl

by performing the procedures above at components combined with additional procedures at group level we have obtained sufficient
and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the group as a whole to provide a basis for our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements

key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgement were of most significance in the audit of the financial
statements we have communicated the key audit matters to the supervisory board but they are not a comprehensive reflection of all
matters that were identified by our audit and that we discussed we described the key audit matters and included a summary of the
audit procedures we performed on those matters the key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial
statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters or on specific
elements of the financial statements any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context

responsibilities of the board of management and the supervisory board
the board of management is responsible for

   the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with euifrs and with part 9 of book 2 of the dutch
    civil code and for the preparation of the report of the board of management pages 2 through 75 in accordance with part 9 of book 2
    of the dutch civil code and for
   such internal control as the board of management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that
    are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error

as part of the preparation of the financial statements the board of management is responsible for assessing the companys ability to
continue as a going concern based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned the board of management should prepare the
financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of management either intends to liquidate the
company or to cease operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so the board of management should disclose events and
circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the companys ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements

the supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the companys financial reporting process

our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for
our opinion our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
misstatement reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance which makes it possible that we may not detect all
misstatements misstatements may arise due to fraud or error they are considered to be material if individually or in the aggregate
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements

a more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to this report

report on other legal and regulatory requirements

our report on the report of the board of management and the other information
pursuant to the legal requirements of part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code concerning our obligation to report about the report of
the board of management and other information

   we have no deficiencies to report as a result of our examination whether the report of the board of management to the extent we
    can assess has been prepared in accordance with part 9 of book 2 of this code and whether the information as required by part 9 of
    book 2 of the dutch civil code has been annexed
   we report that the report of the board of management to the extent we can assess is consistent with the financial statements

our appointment
we were appointed as auditors of postnl nv in 1997 by the supervisory board following the passing of a resolution by the
shareholders at the annual meeting representing a total period of uninterrupted engagement appointment of 19 years following
mandatory firm rotation we will rotate off as auditors after the audit of 2015

appendix to our auditors report on the financial statements 2015 of postnl nv
in addition to what is included in our auditors report we have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements and explained what an audit involves

the auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
we have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with
dutch standards on auditing ethical requirements and independence requirements our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error our audit
consisted among others of

   identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to fraud or error designing and
    performing audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
    basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error
    as fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the intentional override of internal control
   obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
    circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control
   evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures
    made by the board of management
   concluding on the appropriateness of the board of managements use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the
    audit evidence obtained concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events andor conditions that may cast
    significant doubt on the companys ability to continue as a going concern if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists we are
    required to draw attention in our auditors report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or if such disclosures are
    inadequate to modify our opinion our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report
    and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole however future events or conditions may cause
    the company to cease to continue as a going concern
   evaluating the overall presentation structure and content of the financial statements including the disclosures and evaluating
    whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation

considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the companys consolidated financial statements we are responsible for the
direction supervision and performance of the group audit in this context we have determined the nature and extent of the audit
procedures for components of the group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial
statements as a whole determining factors are the geographic structure of the group the significance andor risk profile of group
entities or activities the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which the group operates on this basis we selected
group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary

we communicate with the supervisory board regarding among other matters the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit

we provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence
and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and
where applicable related safeguards

from the matters communicated with the supervisory board we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of
the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters we describe these matters in our auditors
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when in extremely rare circumstances not
communicating the matter is in the public interest

   in this section

   this section sets out postnls corporate responsibility cr reporting policies and guidelines applied in the cr performance
   statements we give an overview of the reporting process and critical estimates and judgements at the end of the section
   we provide an overview of the scope of the cr performance statements and data revisions


11 general
we report on our cr policy and performance statements which are in accordance with the comprehensive option of the latest global
reporting initiative gri g4 guidelines under these guidelines there is a strong focus on materiality we consider topics to be material
when they have a direct or indirect impact on our ability to create preserve or weaken longterm value for us and our stakeholders

longterm value creation is an integral part of our strategy this is why it is important to have reliable and assured information on our
cr performance both internally and externally so that all our stakeholders can make informed decisions to engage with our company
consequently we have integrated the monitoring and managing of financial and cr performance into our daily data processes and
engaged our external auditor pwc to provide reasonable assurance on the cr information pwcs assurance covers the following
chapters we are postnl message from the ceo our value creation process developing our strategy our strategy implementing our
strategy in 2015 and the cr performance statements

12 materiality analysis
as part of our materiality process we looked at a combination of internal and external factors including market trends the competition
 regulatory environment our core competences postnl 2020 concerns expressed directly by stakeholders and broader
expectations of society as part of this process we created a fourstep approach to determine material topics identifying stakeholders
stakeholder dialogue guidelines and benchmarks and selection of material topics

identifying stakeholders
from the analysis of our value creation process we determined our main stakeholder groups the table below outlines our main
stakeholder groups and their interests




postnl realising our potential  16 cr performance statements        160

stakeholder dialogue
we focus on the interests of all of our stakeholders in different ways enabling us to balance their needs to help us understand these
needs we hold annual stakeholder dialogues

in 2015 our annual stakeholder dialogue was attended by customers investors employees independent parcel delivers local
government representatives and social organisations for the first time we also involved a kids counsel an initiative of the missing
chapter foundation young people are our future stakeholders with their own expectations and ideas about our future business which
they provided to us during the meeting

the stakeholder dialogue focused on the question what will ordering and delivery look like in 2020 and what are the requirements for
postnl to be successful additionally a range of other topics were discussed during the dialogue including

   focusing on raising awareness on sustainable cooperation among companies that we work with as well as among customers who are
    ordering and receiving mail and parcels
   how to transition to fossilfuelfree logistics which our stakeholders see as key to becoming the deliverer of the future

more information on how we engage with our stakeholders can be found in the case study stakeholder dialogue
postnlnlstakeholderdialogue

as well as the annual stakeholder dialogue we have regular contact with our suppliers we maintain a sustainable purchase policy
urging our suppliers to conduct operations in a socially and environmentally sound manner and constantly discuss the possibility of
improvements with them we will continue to advocate this policy by setting an example through our own sustainability approach
while we use a wide range of suppliers across the company subcontractors have the most material impact on our cr performance
consequently we have chosen to include subcontractors in the scope of emissions and fatalities in our cr kpis

to reduce the impact our purchasing has on the climate and society as much as possible we select suppliers that are proactive and
innovative in delivering socially responsible products and services additionally we always conduct business on the basis of general
purchasing terms and conditions our business principles and our sustainable supply chain policy this contains policies based on the
latest oecd guidelines we establish measurable objectives and targets to maintain and continually improve our supplier and
subcontractor performance when a supplier or subcontractor cant meet our standards we will stimulate them to develop
improvement plans on the relevant themes we will use the results of our stakeholder dialogue to further refine our sustainable
purchasing plans

guidelines and benchmarks
our assessment of material topics is also based on dominant topics in guidelines and benchmarks such as gri guidelines the un global
compact oecd guidelines dow jones sustainability index and the carbon disclosure project the following benchmarks are
particularly important for us

   dow jones sustainability index djsi for the second year in a row we were ranked as gold class within the djsi in 2015 our score
    was 82 out of 100 2014 83 the djsi is a worldwide benchmark in which organisations are judged on a broad range of themes the
    djsi is important to us as we can compare our results over time and benchmark our progress against our peers more information is
    available at wwwsustainabilityindicescom

selection of material topics

to our stakeholders and our business in the figure below those topics in the upper righthand corner of the matrix are the most
material and are reported on quantitatively the middle section contains topics that are qualitatively disclosed in the report a number
of topics discussed with our stakeholders or identified from benchmarks are defined as nonmaterial to our business and are therefore
not reported on

13 cr reporting process
we established a dedicated cr reporting process that enables us to report on our performance and progress cr data is collected on a
monthly basis using a dedicated it system and is then consolidated and analysed centrally we use companywide definitions when
reporting on the data which are inline with the gri g4 guidelines these definitions can be found in appendix 5 glossary and
definitions an overview of all gri indicators as well as where they can be found in this report is included in appendix 3 global
compact and gri g4 index

all reported data are subject to internal validation procedures on the basis of the data owner first line of defense as well as at the data
validator level second line of defense we have an integrated internal control framework in place which specifies all financial and cr
control procedures and its timing and reporting formats our internal audit department also periodically performs audits on the quality
of data




postnl realising our potential  16 cr performance statements          163

scope of the report
the report includes cr data from all entities that are either fully or majority owned by postnl in accordance with our policy on cr
reporting all companies acquired in any given year must report cr data from the following year postnl companies that are divested 
a full or partial sale whereby we no longer retain a direct or indirect controlling interest  are excluded from the cr reporting scope for
the entire year in which the divestment took place

we excluded regioservice and turbopost both part of our german business postcon from the cr reporting data as they are
transitioning towards a model in which local entrepreneurs are made responsible for the business in the region we also did not include
employees of joint ventures associates and commissioncontracted workers in our cr reporting scope commissioncontracted
workers are paid by output and do not have a labour contract

as subcontractors play an important role in our business we include the impact they have in terms of absolute co2 emissions and fatal
road traffic accidents these subcontractors include independent parcel deliverers and other external parties that transport mail or
parcels for us such as air freight carriers

use of estimates and judgements
in determining our co2 emissions we use co2 conversion factors taken from the 2015 uk defra tables these conversion factors relate
to internationally acknowledged organisations such as the intergovernmental panel on climate change the international energy
agency and the greenhouse gas protocol

figures related to our own co2 emissions where no full data coverage is available are extrapolated to reflect the entire postnl
organisation unless stated otherwise extrapolation is done on the basis of fulltime equivalent fte coverage or square metres the
fte and headcount data in the table for new hires and turnover is based on the number of employees in the netherlands and the data
was then extrapolated to cover the entire company

the accuracy and completeness of cr data depends on the method of measurement the calculation procedure and whether estimates
have been used estimates are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations that we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances

we define coverage as the number of ftes working in entities that report data divided by the total number of ftes in the cr reporting
scope we aim to annually increase our fte coverage the data clarification table in appendix 4 shows the coverage per indicator we
have taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the cr information in this annual report is accurate

the carbon emissions impact for subcontractors is determined based on secondary indicators such as kilometres driven this is
because primary data such as fuel consumption are not available one significant estimation made is carbon emissions as a
percentage of total costs for delivery by subcontractors the estimations made are amongst others derived from tonnes of
co2 emissions per million of euro turnover as reported in the externally published annual reports of royal mail and deutsche post dhl
group this means that there are inherent limitations to the accuracy of the reported subcontractor carbon emissions figures the most
important ones

   the subcontractor model is based on operational systems within postnl but for some subcontractor activities planned figures are
    used instead of actual figures
   for commercial airline haul the subcontractor model uses volumes and kilogrammes of mail which are based on actual 2015 data
   the latest royal mail figures as per 31 march 2015 and reported in their annual report 201415 for deutsche post dhl group we
    applied the latest figures as reported in their annual report 2014

data revision
during 2015 postnl and the management of whistl completed the management buyout of whistl as part of the transaction we
retained a 175 stake in accordance with our cr reporting policy whistl is no longer in scope for postnls cr reporting over 2015 for
comparability reasons all actual cr figures for the years 2011  2014 have been revised for the exclusion of whistl for some of our cr
topics we have displayed the impact of this revision in the table below

during 2015 we detected and revised a misstatement in our absenteeism reporting due to an incorrect definition used in mail in the
netherlands in prior years our absenteeism was underestimated by 02 rounded nominal impact and revised all historical numbers
for this misstatement for the blameworthy road traffic incidents brti we used a new estimation method for our parcels segment

section 2 customer indicators

   in this section

   this section sets out how we measure the way our customers view us we create value by focusing on the interests of our
   customers which ranges from introducing innovative services and solutions to constantly striving to better our customer
   contact the results of these efforts are indicated in the following customer indicators

we measure customer satisfaction through an online survey which looks at how we resolve complaints the delivery time of letters and
parcels and the quality of our delivery in 2015 we improved on the handling of complaints and managed to reduce the number of
complaints by 13 additionally we introduced our business portal for our business customers these improvements aided in
achieving a one percentage point increase in customer satisfaction compared to 2014 since 2012 our customer satisfaction score has
increased significantly which we believe is due to our greater focus on our culture and customers

customer satisfaction is partly determined by the quality of our mail delivery each year we hire an independent research firm to test
our delivery process by sending trackable letters through our network these letters are scanned along the entire sorting process
enabling us to identify any delays such measures helped us maintain a delivery quality for standard mail in 2015 of 964 well above
the minimum required level of 95

we offer our business customers a carbon neutral delivery proposition via our website wwwgroenepostnl they can compensate the
co2 impact of the letters and parcels they sent via postnl the co2 impact of the compensated sendings is calculated at 10 kilotonnes
co2 2014 10 these emissions were compensated using gold standard credits to encourage customers to compensate the carbon
emissions of the mail and parcels they send with us we double the amount paid by customers for co2 compensation up to a maximum
of 50000 this additional contribution is invested in green projects in the netherlands

a tool we use to manage overall quality is iso 9001 certification iso 9001 sets requirements for continuous quality improvements
across the company with a focus on providing better service and quality we encourage all postnl companies to acquire iso 9001
certification in 2015 the percentage of ftes working at iso 9001 certified sites increased to 96 resulting from the successful
inclusion of our head office departments in the audit scope

   if it were not for our people there would be no postnl our people keep the company running from the truck drivers in the early
   morning to the mail sorters late at night from innovative thinkers to the support staff and of course our mail and parcel
   deliverers

   we have created a working environment in which our employees feel valued and at home and are given the opportunity to grow
   and develop and we provide employees with training and when necessary new career opportunities we invest in a sustainable
   future both for our company and for the people who work for and with us

   the outcome of these efforts are monitored and measured through employee turnover employee engagement recruitment and
   career development diversity and inclusion and health  safety indicators and are outlined below

for the purpose of the cr performance statements we do not report on employees of joint ventures in which we have a minority stake
or new entities that were purchased during the reporting year

our workforce in general declines in line with the ongoing decline in mail volumes in the netherlands however this is partially offset by
the growth in our parcels and international businesses we expect the number of ftes to further decline in the coming years as result
of our cost savings programmes

as a postal company we hire a relatively high number of parttime employees who work with us for less than a year this is reflected in
our new hire and turnover figures there is a particularly high turnover rate among the under 30s because many students take
parttime jobs as deliverers for those employees affected by job cuts we offer a comprehensive mobility programme to help them

to monitor our employee engagement we carry out a company wide online engagement survey this survey is conducted twice per
year by an external party the survey looks at employees overall satisfaction levels including their sense of pride in the company and
their connection to the onepostnl culture

employee engagement improved in 2015 driven by factors such as a sense of responsibility independence and working together with
colleagues and helped by the implementation of our onepostnl culture programme which aims to foster an environment that
promotes closer collaboration within the company our aim is to continuously improve the engagement of our employees

we recognise that having the right talent is vital for the future of the company from the operators of our nextgeneration sorting
machines to senior managers personal development is an important driver for most of our employees it stimulates engagement and is
key for the future success of postnl

in 2015 we continued to develop learning based on the 702010 framework this framework is based on the insight that 70 percent of
learning takes place through daytoday practice while only around 10 percent comes from formal training the other 20 percent is
composed of informal coaching and supervision we offer training programmes through our postnl academy which is available to all
postnl employees this digital learning portal enables employees to further expand their personal and professional development in a
variety of ways improving their skills and ultimately their employability the postnl academy is available 247 and employees can

select which learning modules to follow themselves

we facilitated the career development of high potentials through three career development programmes the programmes aim to
develop high potential employees on the companys leadership competences while taking them to the next level of personal
leadership we frame our development programmes in three career phases

   our young executive programme
   the young managers in action and the innovation challenge
   the mastering your leadership programme

the young executive programme teaches graduates how to learn effectively using their own knowledge and expertise studying the
organisation and their local environment and the companys strategy the focus is on improving their performance and personal
development while developing a personal network within the company the young managers in action programme and the innovation
challenge focus on professionals with 4 to 10years experience the aim is to create personal leadership develop strategic innovative
and entrepreneurial competences and help participants discover their creative mind the mastering your leadership programme is
targeted at professionals with more than 10years experience the aim is to increase their ability in interpreting the companys strategy
directly into their own business environment while developing and stimulating entrepreneurship to generate future business
opportunities

in 2015 the number of training hours per fte increased due mainly to the implementation of the new smx additionally we retained
investors in people iip certification coverage of well above 90 of our headcount this certification covers a number of areas
including hr policies and educational and development opportunities

34 diversity and inclusion
                                                                                2015          2014          2013         2012          2011

diversity amongst our workforce and management which reflects the diversity within society is crucial it creates a healthier more
sustainable working environment and is vital in realising our ambitions this is why we hire qualified people who fit within our culture
irrespective of their ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation

we support diversity and inclusion and support networks that foster this in 2015 for example we signed the diversity charter which
operates across 14 european countries and has been signed by more than 7000 companies and organisations it is an important tool to
stimulate diversity we also support several communities to stimulate diversity including pride the gay lesbian bi and transsexual
network we also participate in events and initiatives to promote and stimulate diversity such as the gay pride canal parade in 2015
we participated for the first time in the workplace pride benchmark a global online survey based upon organisations policies and
practices ending first in our category

we aim to increase the number of women that work within management in 2015 we continued our successful women inclusion
network win initiative and mentoring programmes a background story of what win means to its members is given in the case
study inclusion postnlnlwin in addition we paid special attention to female talent in our succession and talent management
approach we are also a member of the talent to the top charter a countrywide platform to facilitate and stimulate recruitment and
the development of women to senior positions in private and public companies

based on these and other initiatives we have been able to increase the number of women in senior management positions over the
last few years

accidents
we work hard to improve the safety of our employees as part of their work our employees drive and walk millions of kilometres each
year which means they regularly face traffic risks by training our employees to drive and work more safely we strive to further reduce
the number of accidents

despite all our efforts and initiatives we deeply regret having to report three fatal accidents across our operations in 2015 2014 2 in
the first accident an ebike rider was struck and fatally injured by one of our independent parcel deliverers the second accident
involved one of our doortodoor delivers who died after being hit by a car in the third accident a subcontractor struck a pedestrian
while backing up these were tragic events and we remain determined to prevent fatalities

the number of serious accidents and lost time accidents increased there was a rise in the number of serious accidents involving bikes
and scooters which is due to the ongoing switch from cars and vans to bikes and scooters the same effect is visible for lost time
accidents in 2016 we will develop plans to reduce serious and lost time accidents

we encourage all of our business units to obtain the ohsas 18001 certification which is a standard for occupational health and safety
management systems and is intended to help control risks the increase in ftes working in certified sites in 2015 resulted from the
successful inclusion of our head office departments

absenteeism
we focus on reducing absenteeism as this is an indicator of the overall health of our employees one way in which we do so is by
running preventative programmes making employees more aware of their health these programmes include health tests and a range
of sporting associations available across the company due to our active approach and preventative programmes we saw a further
improvement in absenteeism numbers in 2015

traffic incidents
road traffic incidents are considered blameworthy if a postnl driver is at fault all other incidents include a variety of types of damage
including damage discovered during inspections damage caused by third parties to our parked vehicles and other instances of minor
damage continuous focus on safety training and communication resulted in a decline in the number of blameworthy road traffic
incidents per 100000 kilometres driven in 2015

section 4 environmental indicators

   in this section

   we report on our environmental performance we strive to continually reduce our environmental impact by lowering our energy
   consumption our buildings small trucks and vans large trucks and subcontractors impact our environmental footprint as do our
   business travel and company cars

   based on our materiality analysis we selected the most material environmental topics co2 nox and pm10 emissions co2 has a
   longterm impact on the climate while nox and pm10 emissions reduce air quality impacting peoples health

   the co2 efficiency index reflects our efforts to reduce our own carbon footprint we describe which actions were taken to
   improve our co2 efficiency in 2015 at the end of the section we report on our absolute co2 footprint divided into scope 1 scope
   2 and scope 3 emissions in line with the greenhouse gas protocol




41 co2 efficiency index
                                                                               2015         2014          2013         2012          2011

as a postal and logistic solutions provider it is clear we have an impact on the environment and that our operations emit co2 however
stakeholders are increasingly asking for environmentally friendly logistics operations

in 2008 we introduced the co2 efficiency index our ambition is to reduce the co2 efficiency index to 45 by 2020 base year 2007 
100 the index consists of three components buildings small trucks and vans and large trucks the impact of each is weighted
according to their absolute carbon emissions in the base year

to achieve this ambition we take into account energy efficiency when introducing new technologies for example our nextgeneration
sorting machines within our mail in the netherlands segment and the new sorting and delivery centres in our parcels segment
additionally we replace fossilbased energy with biobased energy whenever possible

the improvement in our co2 efficiency index in 2015 was helped by migrating towards sustainable electricity use at our nexive
operations in italy and the introduction of over 140 green gas vehicles in our dutch operations which are co2 neutral to realise our
longterm co2 efficiency index goal we will continue to optimise our logistics processes and move to biobased energy when possible

within mail in the netherlands over the past three years we have reduced the number of preparation centres we operate from around
280 to 80 in response to the shrinking mail market at the same time our parcels segment has invested in new sorting and delivery
centres opening their eighteenth in 2015 to more efficiently process the increase in parcels volume driven by the growth in
ecommerce these new centres have an a energy label based on stateoftheart building techniques including optimal use of day
light and energyefficient sorting machines more about these new centers can be found in the case study new delivery and sorting
centres for parcels postnlnlsortingdeliverycentre in total we operate over 950000 square metres of buildings

we strive to reduce the energy we use in our buildings in 2015 we used 98 million kwh of electricity 2014 104 and 50 million cubic
metres of gas 2014 54 of which 13 million came from renewable biogas this helped us improve our co2 efficiency expressed in kg
co2 per square metre significantly to 85 2014 131




postnl realising our potential  16 cr performance statements        171

in addition to our energy reduction initiatives we also use sustainable energy whenever possible we use sustainable carbonneutral
electricity in all buildings in the netherlands where we manage our own energy contracts in 2015 our italian business nexive also
moved to carbonneutral electricity more about this transition can be found in the case study 100 sustainable electricity in italy
postnlnlnexiveenergy

by the end of 2015 89 of all the electricity we used was sustainable 2014 82 when third parties manage the energy contracts
we encourage the use of sustainable electricity for those buildings where no sustainable electricity is used carbon emissions are
compensated by gold standard credits

to aid longterm comparability of emissions we use a correction factor called degree days to compensate for relatively mild or severe
winter conditions this correction factor was used in the co2 efficiency numbers presented above kg co2m2

going forward we expect our nextgeneration sorting machines and the introduction of led lighting to have a positive impact on our
electricity usage from 2016 we will install solar panels on fifteen of our parcels sorting and delivery centres the estimated energy
production of these panels is 48 million kwh which is the equivalent of the electricity usage of around 1500 households we expect
these panels to generate over 40 of the centres total electricity needs

as sustainable delivery is one of our material topics we concentrate on reducing the environmental footprint of our logistics activities
our customers and the society in which we operate increasingly ask for sustainable delivery alternatives for our fleet of vehicles the
focus is on optimising our network to reduce the number of kilometres driven in 2015 we reduced by 5 the number of kilometers our
small trucks and vans drove

over the course of the year the number of small trucks in use decreased to 1760 2014 1923 the co2 efficiency grams per
kilometres improved to 231 2014 239 which was partially caused by the use of over 140 green gas trucks in our fleet green gas is
biobased gas made suitable for fuel usage it has virtually no carbon emissions compared to fossilbased fuels and has significantly
lower levels of nitrogen oxides nox and particulate matters pm10 emissions which helps improve air quality and health as green gas
is not yet available at all fuel stations we use compressed natural gas cng when necessary and offset our carbon emissions with gold
standard credits

we plan to increase the number of green gas vehicles we operate in the coming years this decision is based on financial
environmental and practical availability of green gas at the given location considerations when vehicles are due for replacement we
investigate if green gas vehicles are suitable if that is not feasible we then introduce euro 5 and euro 6 vehicles also resulting in lower
nox and pm10 emissions

we are looking into the feasibility of replacing some of our small trucks with electricscooters and bikes in 2015 we started a pilot
with two types of electric scooters the results of this pilot will be available and evaluated during 2016

large trucks are a crucial part of our logistics network forming the link between our collecting sorting and preparation locations our
activities to optimise our networks with less locations make transportation between depots more efficient

in 2015 the number of large trucks we operate decreased to 191 2014 203 we reduced the number of kilometres driven by 5 as
we have yet to find a suitable biobased fuel alternative all our current large trucks run on fossil fuels the co2 efficiency of large
trucks was mainly affected by changes in the fleet composition due to volume increases within our parcels business we introduced
larger heavier trucks

when vehicles are due for replacement we introduce vehicles complying to the highest euro norm available this improves our nox and
pm10 emission numbers as euro 6 trucks have lower emission levels than euro 5 trucks

we will continue to investigate the possibilities of alternative fuels and keep replacing vehicles that comply to the highest euro norm to
further improve the environmental footprint of our large trucks

45 absolute co2 footprint
in addition to reporting on our co2 efficiency which is described in the previous sections we also report our absolute co2 emissions in
accordance with the greenhouse gas ghg protocol the absolute carbon footprint in kilotonnes is reported in three categories

   scope 1 covers all direct emissions generated by sources that are owned or leased by the company such as operational vehicles and
    heating
   scope 2 includes all emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the company
   scope 3 refers to indirect emissions that are a consequence of the companys activities but arise from sources not owned or controlled
    by the company

the carbon footprint as recognised by the ghg protocol includes company cars business travel by air and subcontractors postnl has
less influence on these categories but still has a shared responsibility for their carbon output which is reported as scope 3 emissions



postnl realising our potential  16 cr performance statements         174

scope 1
our gross scope 1 emissions decreased slightly this was partly due to a decrease in the number of large trucks we operated and the
number of kilometers driven we reduced the number of facilities we operate and opened new energy efficient locations which
combined with mild winter conditions decreased our absolute gas usage the gross emissions from our small trucks remained stable

in 2015 we purchased 13 million cubic metres of biogas from renewable sources to heat our buildings this amounted to a reduction of
23 kilotonnes in co2 emissions we used gold standard credits to compensate the co2 emissions of our green gas vehicles combined
this amounted to 14 kilotonnes of offset co2 emissions in total this resulted in a decrease of our net scope 1 emissions over the past
five years our absolute net scope 1 emissions have decreased by 25

scope 2
our gross scope 2 emissions decreased in 2015 due to our lower electricity consumption the majority of the electricity we use comes
from sustainable sources and is considered carbon neutral in 2015 the use of this sustainable electricity reduced our co2 emissions
by 34 kilotonnes additionally we purchase gold standard offset credits for buildings which we rent with an allinclusive square metre
tariff this amounted to 6 kilotonnes of offset carbon emissions in total our net scope 2 emissions decreased in 2015 over the last five
years our absolute net scope 2 emissions have decreased by 100

scope 3
our gross and net scope 3 emissions increased significantly in 2015 due to the expansion of our subcontracted international activities
the increase in our subcontractor co2 emissions to 239 kilotonnes 2014 147 kilotonnes mainly relates to the rise in exports of milk
powder to china intercontinental air freight resulted in higher co2 emissions than those from our domestic and european markets
where goods are mostly transported by truck

during the year the number of company cars declined to approximately 1584 2014 1716 a significant percentage are used by team
leaders who visit mail delivery depots each day we have adjusted our company car lease policy to stimulate the use of more
fuelefficient cars since the majority of our activities take place in the netherlands air emissions by business travel are not deemed
material the emissions that did arise were stable in comparison to pervious years during the year we purchased gold standard credits
to compensate 9 kilotonnes of co2 emissions from company cars and business travel

we have adopted the international standard iso 14001 which helps us control environmental issues minimise harmful effects on the
environment and helps improve our ongoing environmental performance we encourage all business units to acquire the iso 14001
certification in 2015 the percentage of ftes working at iso 14001 certified entities increased to 96 resulting from the successful

independent assurance report
to the board of management of postnl nv

the board of management of postnl nv postnl the hague engaged us to provide reasonable assurance on certain information
corporate responsibility information in the annual report 2015 we believe our engagement fulfils a rational objective as disclosed
by postnl in the section cr performance statements  section 1 basis of preparation

development during the year in accordance with postnls reporting criteria

this opinion is to be read in the context of what we described in the remainder of this report

what we are assuring
we have assured the corporate responsibility information included in the following sections of the annual report for the year 2015

professional and ethical standards applied
we conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with dutch law including standard 3810n assurance engagements relating
to sustainability reports hereafter standard 3810n our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the our
responsibilities section of this report

we are independent of postnl in accordance with the verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij
assuranceopdrachten vio and other relevant independence regulations in the netherlands furthermore we have complied with
the verordening gedrags en beroepsregels accountants vgba and other relevant regulations

limitations in our scope
the corporate responsibility information contains prospective information such as ambitions strategy targets expectations and
projections inherent to this information is that actual future results may be different from the prospective information and therefore it
may be uncertain we do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and feasibility of this prospective information

we draw your attention to the following sentence at the end of chapter developing our strategy the percentages related to the
development of market shares are postnl estimates and are not validated by pwc

the auditor is not expected to and cannot reduce the assurance risk to zero and cannot therefore obtain absolute assurance that the
corporate responsibility information is free from material misstatement due to fraud or error this is because there are inherent
limitations of an assurance engagement which result in most of the assurance evidence on which the auditor bases the auditors
opinion being persuasive rather than conclusive

reporting criteria
postnl developed its corporate responsibility reporting criteria on the basis of the g4 guidelines of the global reporting initiative gri
comprehensive option which are disclosed together with detailed information on the reporting scope and reporting process and
methods in the section cr performance statements  section 1 basis of preparation we consider the sustainability reporting criteria
to be relevant and appropriate for our examination

understanding reporting and measurement methodologies

materiality
we set thresholds for materiality at the planning stage and reassessed them during the engagement these helped us to determine the
nature timing and extent of our procedures and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements on the information presented both
individually and in the aggregate based on our professional judgement we determined the materiality level at 5 for each element of
the corporate responsibility information except for fatalities whereby each fatality is considered material when determining our
materiality thresholds we considered the relevance of information for both the stakeholders and the company based on the
materiality assessment of postnl

areas of particular focus
the areas of particular focus that in our professional judgement were of most significance in the assurance engagement of the
corporate responsibility information including the allocation of our resources and effort are identified below together with an
explanation of how we tailored our procedures to address these specific matters this is not a complete list of all risks andor matters
identified by our work

we have communicated the areas of particular focus with the supervisory board these areas were addressed in the context of our
assurance engagement of the corporate responsibility information as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon we do not provide a
separate opinion on these areas of particular focus

                   our daily business energy usage and emissions are reported internally on a monthly base and environmental management targets are set we
                   manage our emissions by our co2 efficiency index with the aim to improve our co2 efficiency with 55 in 2020 compared to the base year 2007
                   we take measures to improve our own emissions such as the use of co2neutral electricity and gas in our buildings and greengas for our vehicles

                   consumption and decrease our emissions we invest in new technologies as energy efficient buildings lighting trucks and sorting machines we
                   also stimulate our subcontractors to reduce their emissions by ecodriving and set a minimum requirement euro 5 for the type of trucks they use
