in march 2011 brother formulated its new midterm business strategy cs b2015 on the theme
of back to growth in the same month that the great east japan earthquake struck against this
backdrop brother industries president toshikazu koike invited iruka goodwill ambassador of the
international union for conservation of nature and natural resources iucn to discuss a
sustainable society and brothers csr management

a message to victims of the great east japan earthquake
koikefirst of all i would like to oﬀer my deepest condolences again to the victims of the great east
japan earthquake on march 11 and wish for the quickest possible recovery of the damaged areas
on that day i was in the head oﬃce in nagoya and felt that slow long shake of a large earthquake i
intuitively knew that the earthquake must have been massive if the epicenter was far from nagoya and
indeed it turned out to be a calamity the brother group did not suﬀer direct damage in terms of
human resources but our group company xings aﬃliated facilities in the tohoku and kanto regions
and some of our parts suppliers were aﬀected by the disaster for the time being we will continuously
oﬀer support as best we can including donations from brother donations and relief supplies from
group companies employees in and outside japan freeofcharge repair services for brother products
in the disasterstricken areas and donations of brother products to support organizations in the
aﬀected areas the impact on our business was minimal because our overseas sales account for nearly
80 and overseas production for over 80 but it will take a long time for the area to recover so it is
important to continue to provide support and step up our volunteer activities

irukawe have to unite our hearts under these
circumstances i was in tokyo on the day and immediately
huddled under a desk when the earthquake struck the
tremor threw my body sideways i turned on the tv and
saw unbelievable images the only thing i can do is to sing
songs so i have wanted to assist the recovery through the
power of songs since that day though people in the
aﬀected areas are probably not yet ready to enjoy songs i
do not want to be pushy but i also know there will be
chances in the near future i hope to help when the time is
right until then i will continue to place donation boxes at
my concert venues and donate the entire sales of the pamphlets that were produced to commemorate
the 40th anniversary of my debut i am on a concert tour this year on the theme of concerts to support
the recovery from the earthquake the subtitle tomo ni ikiru kono toki wo living this moment
together was added as a personal message i have also composed songs that reﬂect my feelings i have
continued with the concert tour so that my fans can feel relaxed or encouraged even if only a little i
would like to invite people from the disasterstricken areas to my concerts and sing songs together
starting this autumn if possible

koikefor six years i have been updating my inhouse blog terrys tsurezure diary for employees
twice a week the total number of entries will reach 500 soon so i launched terrys kizuna project to
involve employees speciﬁcally i am producing charity tshirts to commemorate the 500th posting at
my own expense and will give away the tshirts which feature my handwriting and an illustration of my
photos that appears on my blog to employees who pay the participation fee all participation fees
collected will be donated to the devastated areas the concept seems to be exactly the same as your
pamphlets

irukayes isnt it a coincidence some concert venues prohibit donation boxes so i thought about
other options and came up with the idea of selling pamphlets and donating the sales obviously
donations are highly appreciated but i wanted to reﬂect my own unique style

koike i think support activities should be basically to a reasonable extent ongoing and natural if we
push ourselves too hard we will run out of steam and lose momentum and if we are not fully
convinced we cannot provide commitment over a long term i tell employees to work on volunteer and
social contribution activities within the scope they can do reasonably and naturally

iruka i agree i have been working on these activities out of a desire to do something and feel
rewarded by putting my wishes into action i think that is enough if i tried to create a good appearance
for my actions they would turn out diﬀerently and though some people would be helped i believe that
longterm commitment within the extent possible while smiling is the right way for me

 koikes nickname of terry was given to him when he worked as a representative in the us
   today koike is called terrysan in the group in recognition of his friendliness

                                                                   public attention among people of diﬀerent generations to
                                                                   biodiversity in an easytounderstand manner because it is a
diﬃcult concept so i suggested producing a cd and holding concerts i also write and draw picture
books so i contacted a publishing company and suggested that a picture book for small children based
on biodiversity might be a good idea which led to a picture book called maarui inochi being published

koikethe brother group supported the objective of the conference activities included donating
printers to be used by cop10 participants in the internet lounge booth exhibition as one of six printer
manufacturers collaborating on the ink cartridge return project and donating to the united nations
environment programme unep the conference was a great success agreements were reached on
the nagoya protocol which sets rules for sharing the beneﬁts of genetic resources and aichi
biodiversity targets to be applied after 2010 among others i also attended your maaruichikyu
round earth concert in nagoya during the conference period

irukathank you very much i had promised the iucn headquarters to give a concert during the
conference period more than 50 conference participants came to the concert to refresh their minds
with music in the midst of endless meetings so i thought it was worth holding the concert i learned that
the brother group has been working hard on environmental issues

koikeyes for many years employees around the world have volunteered to plant seedlings protect
mangrove forests and support ecosystem surveys on sea turtles for example as part of environmental
and social contribution activities in may 2010 we chose the slogan brother earth as a symbol of our
global environmental eﬀorts spanning all our manufacturing and business operations as well as activities
that i mentioned earlier based on the slogan we have been channeling our resources to achieving the
2015 midterm environmental action plan
meanwhile brotherearthcom a website featuring clickfundraising introduces the environmental
protection activities being done by group companies in various regions visitors to the website are
requested to click on the activities they want to support and brother industries then donates money on
behalf of visitors to environmental activities depending on the number of clicks the brother earth
websites are available in seven languages
however its not clear to what extent individual companies can address the huge challenge of
protecting the ecosystem as cop10 showed have you got any suggestions based on your experience
about possible activities for brother

irukathe three international institutions of the iucn the world bank and the global environment
facility have jointly launched a program called sos save our species a fund for conserving a wide
range of species and they are looking for partner companies to support their activities contributions
to this program will be publicized around the world because participating companies are recognized as
global leaders in conserving biodiversity participation in sos also helps improve the corporate image

koikethats interesting as we work on challenges related to biodiversity conservation speciﬁc
suggestions for assisting conservation activities in diﬀerent countries will help employees in group
companies understand the importance of such activities participating in support activities to the best
of our ability will help us to grow as a global company

irukathe year 2011 is also the international year of forests iucns activities are related to forest
protection and are also closely linked with the paper that we use in daily life forestrelated
symposiums have been held around the world the company name brother has a good image because
it is analogous to the message i have been giving living things on our planet are brothers who support
one another i greatly respect your activities under the brother earth slogan based on the notion that
all living things on earth are linked to one another

 the global environment facility is one of the worlds largest international funds that provide ﬁnancial resources and
   technical support for work in various countries for the beneﬁt of the global environment




overcoming difficulties to achieve new growth

irukafor people of my generation brother is still largely
synonymous with sewing machines for younger people
brother is a manufacturer of multifunction centers and
printers brother has changed a lot over the years

koikeyes companies have to keep changing to ensure
longterm sustainable growth established 103 years ago
brother has changed its main business over a cycle of
several decades to achieve new growth through trial and
error of course we have experienced management
diﬃculties and most recently we had to extend the time
span of our mid and longterm strategy vision for
achieving sales of jpy 1 trillion following the lehman shock in 2008 however our each line of business
has worked to build a stable foundation that is less susceptible to changes in the global management
environment while securing proﬁt and cash we have prepared ourselves for future growth
as a next step we announced the new midterm business strategy cs b2015 in march 2011 on the
theme of back to growth this strategy is intended to achieve growth in all businesses in all regions by
2015 our activities aim to speed up the process of becoming a truly global company in respective
sectors including development manufacturing sales and marketing human assets csr and brand

fortunately we are cost competitive and have built a network for delivering highquality products across the
world because we were quick to set up manufacturing and sales operations outside japan we also take
pride in our human assets and expertise accumulated over many decades by enhancing these strengths
we can manufacture the best products that meet the needs of our customers and at the best locations we
can thus show our global team brother through mutual cooperation among group companies i believe that
our mission to place the customer ﬁrst everywhere every time and provide them with superior value by
quickly creating and delivering highquality products and services as set forth in the brother group global
charter can be achieved by promoting eﬀorts positively pleasantly and powerfully

irukait is amazing to do business on such a global scale it is human nature to stick to past successes
for the rest of ones life and yet brother has been expanding its unique business operations while
considering the next generation im sure it is not easy to set the vision singers and artists are
considered always uptodate but it is hard to turn out big hits every year and so some people turn to
other ﬁelds if one wants to establish ones identity into the future it is important to be sensitive to
changes in the world while having a ﬁrm anchor for oneself

koike exactly the same applies to companies

ruka i started my career as a singer in folk and new music but i had a sense of crises many times
such as during the bubble economy when people get rich they start to like ﬂashy things that are not
directly related to daily life when disco music was in people criticized artists who sang with just a
guitar as being insipid i found it diﬃcult to attract fans to concerts but i stuck to my career this was
probably because throughout my career i have valued both the stubbornness to stick to my policy and
the ﬂexibility to change with the times i wonder how many more years i will be able to continue singing
but i want to pursue my own style i hope that my commitment to singing will inspire the next generation
including my son

whether their internal control systems are functioning eﬀectively and internal auditing departments
conduct audits from an independent viewpoint after making the necessary improvements an internal
control report that includes the description we determine that the internal control concerning the
ﬁnancial reporting of the group is eﬀective was submitted to the financial services agency

 reducing power consumption during product use in particular during the standby mode therefore
 successfully oﬀsetting carbon dioxide co2 emissions during production by energy saving during
 product use brother technology shenzhen ltd one of the major manufacturing facilities producing
 fax machines and printers has worked on a largescale greening initiative on the rooftop of a newly
 constructed building these accomplishments represent the progress in activities through proposals
 and practices by local employees
improvement in customer satisfaction the product returns and servicing rate has helped brother
 visualize and identify issues and has led to various achievements including reduction in the number of
 troubles and failures as well as the time required for repair

eﬀorts that have shown progress but require more commitment
user and ecofriendly product development all models of
 brothers new multifunction centers released in fy 2010 have
 been certiﬁed with major eco labels in europe while some models
 have been shipped with automatic doublesided printing set as
 default which deserves recognition i hope that brother will
 continue to further reduce environmental impact during use
 speciﬁcally i would like brother to promote the use of universal

  thirdparty opinion
increase in diversity and utilization of human resources brother has made progress on this front
 based on its midterm human resources development strategy for example university graduates
 international students who graduated from universities in japan and students who graduated from
 universities overseas account for 28 of new recruits and brother industries continues to send
 employees to facilities overseas under the group trainee program regarding group companies in
 china eﬀorts have been made to develop human resources general managers or their equivalent
 while promoting appointment to managerial positions and delegation of authority these eﬀorts should

 developing global human resources including integration of compensation systems
creation of workplaces where employees can easily continue to work brother mothers activities involving
 working mothers who work for group companies in japan have been gaining momentum while
 onemonth transition periods have been introduced under the labor agreement so that women can easily
 come back to work after maternity leave which is highly noteworthy i hope that respective workplaces will
 identify and resolve issues so as to increase the rate of taking leave andor parttime shifts for child care
 family care and nursing care 319 at brother industries manufacturing facilities in china have also
 made progress in giving consideration to and taking care of expectant employees against the backdrop

social contribution activities more than 8900 employees accounting for approximately 30 of brothers
 global workforce have joined brother eco point activities to reduce environmental impact on a daytoday
 basis brother employees are also engaged in activities using inhouse resources such as producing
 reusable shopping bags with sewing machines these eﬀorts are highly evaluated i hope that brother will

  developing products with customers first in mind

a framework for quickly and comprehensively reﬂecting customer
feedback in our products
conducting various surveys to identify potential needs and embodying them in products
all of the brother groups business activities are driven by
feedback from customers opinions and requests are solicited
at various times and compiled into a database
in the planning phase for a new product in particular those in
charge of planning and development visit customers organize
group interviews and conduct webbased surveys these
extensive indepth surveys are designed to identify the
environments in which products are used and to analyze
impressions and requests so that potential needs  which
even customers are not aware of  are identiﬁed and reﬂected
when developing the next models
this process helps to ensure that the functions sizes designs
and prices of products perfectly match customers needs this
is all part of the brother groups commitment to providing
                                                                                framework for reﬂecting customer feedback
customers with new values and satisfaction                                     in product development




how brother developed the mfcj6710dw an a3 color inkjet
multifunction center
the concept of nextgeneration models emerged
from feedback from global customers
in 2008 brother released the mfc6490cn the worlds
smallest a3capable color inkjet multifunction center we
had little information about how this newly developed product
was being used by customers so to get their feedback we
conducted interviews by visiting them as well as questionnaire
surveys worldwide the surveys revealed that customers have
diﬀerent needs in diﬀerent regions for example customers in
japan highly valued the compactness signiﬁcantly smaller
than conventional a3 copiers and reasonable price while                     mfcj6710dw a new product

customers in the us liked the unique a3 printingscanning
features but wanted better basic performance such as speed
image quality and reliability

   comparison in size in the category of a3 color
 multifunction centers as of march 2008 based on our survey




                                                                              gathering and analyzing feedback from

a project was begun to reﬂect feedback from customers and create
a compact a3 color multifunction center that is easy to use in small
oﬃces including sohos with signiﬁcantly improved performance as
a business machine such as printing speed and ink capacity while
keeping the size and price unchanged
however the technical hurdles to be overcome were highly
challenging for example to speed up printing it is necessary to
increase the number of ink jet nozzles and cover a large space in a                                  a new head mechanism with double the

single printing process this requires a large printing head which                                  increase the printing speed and ensure
cannot ﬁt in a body of a speciﬁed size meanwhile ink droplets need                                 image quality

to be controlled in picoliters one trillionth of a liter to ensure vivid
images and sharp characters at higher speeds under the slogan of
never give up the project team steadily overcame the challenges one by one through numerous
simulations experiments and prototypes


more than double the printing speed of previous models with excellent
performance in automatic doublesided printing  scanning

from 2010 to 2011 we launched new a3 color inkjet
multifunction centers with a highspeed printing
engine for the business market
the printing speed is more than double and yet the
body is almost the same size as that of the previous
models to reduce the running costs the ink
capacity is also signiﬁcantly increased about 25 and
16 times for black and color respectively compared
                                                                              delivering high productivity with signiﬁcantly increased
with brothers previous models the stronger upper                            blackcolor ink capacity and a largecapacity paper tray
and lower paper trays can accommodate a total of
500 sheets of paper the new models feature a
number of useful functions for business users in terms of eﬃciency and economy in largevolume
printing such as automatic doublesided scanning mfcj6910dw and automatic doublesided
printing ecofriendly performance is also enhanced with the co2 emissions in use ﬁveyear power
consumption 12 lower than those of the 2008 models
the brother group will continue to carefully listen to feedback from customers to enable us to
manufacture products that make customers say this is exactly the a3 color multifunction center i
wanted

 the numerical values for ink capacity and power consumption are based on comparisons with previous models in japan

production schedules might be delayed and defects might arise

many of these troubles can be prevented however by simple daytoday
maintenance by customers relatively minor troubles such as loose contact                     tcs2dn a new model of cnc

addressing the underlying causes of problems within
the community and then providing solutions that transform peoples lives brother employees support
this mission in various ways such as by giving a ﬁnancial donation andor by volunteering their time and
energy to community programs

to promote awareness of the united way and their programs many events and raﬄes were held during
the campaigns throughout the usa for example at the new jersey kickoﬀ breakfast over 125
employees turned out to ﬁnd out more about the scuw and its services as well as to enjoy a great
breakfast another nj event for the third consecutive year was a food drive to beneﬁt the food bank
network of somerset county2 the amount of food that was donated by employees reached over 19
large boxes

poor and needy the activities then spread to europe the food bank foundation of madrid provides
food free of charge via more than 600 charitable organizations to people who do not have enough to
eat due to various circumstances
