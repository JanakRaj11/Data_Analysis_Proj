2 biodiversity

within the last 50 years roughly 60 of ecosystems has been
disturbed by human activities at global level 70 of flora species
are either threatened or endangered of vanishing while the
biodiversity destruction rate is continuously increasing at

essential component of our ecosystems balance and therefore
focus our efforts to preserve it

     good practice

environmentally friendlier stores
adopting modern practices in environmental planning and following
the renovations of carrefour alimos and macedonia hypermarkets
in 2012 we renovated and conducted significant interventions in our
carrefour hypermarket in maroussi at avenue shopping center
and in ioannina and argos stores which led to an annual energy
consumption reduction of 2833 interventions applied addressed
mainly cooling and heating systems lighting and generally
electromagnetic and cooling installations

due to these interventions carbon dioxide savings correspond to a
total of 173000 trees or 3460 acres of forest which would be
required to absorb the corresponding carbon dioxide savings from
these three stores




      practices in other countries

carrefour cyprus in order to achieve energy savings has installed closedtype refrigerators and freezers which allow better cooling
distribution and has also replaced all light bulbs with economy lamps

we strongly believe that solely supporting financially the                   the efforts of individuals and organizations in the context of
underprivileged degrades the significance of social contribution and         strengthening the institution proved to be decisive with the following
potentially facilitates questionably responsible management practices       being the most significant
for this reason our policy is to contribute mainly by providing              gathering  10500 from the summer bazaar of ellinogermaniki
