   environmental consideration in production saving energy preventing global warming




   switch to lng fuel  all 7 domestic plants completed the switch to gas following the ibaraki plant
kagome has switched the fuel it uses for boilers to create
steam used in heating and pasteurizing products to gas plants
not connected to a nearby pipeline have switched their fuel
from heavy oil to liquefied natural gas lng which is more
environmentally friendly
  all seven of kagomes owned and operated plants have
been switched over to gas as of february 2015 when the
ibaraki plant made this change
  the ibaraki plant expects to reduce co2 emissions by
approximately 800t annually

      recycling center
kagome sets up recycling centers on the premises of its plants
to recycle production byproducts
  for example the fujimi plant painstakingly separates such
materials as drum and plastictype raw material containers
and scrap metal into 63 classifications within 19 categories
these recycled materials are carefully stored until they can be
collected by respective vendors in addition placing these cen
ters in locations that are highly visible from outside the plants
ensures that stored materials are correctly separated and                    nasu plants recycling center

biodiversity protection
   basic approach to biodiversity protection
in the course of its long history kagome has developed a wide
variety of products based on natures myriad gifts such as
tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables kagome seeks to
contribute to the wellbeing and longevity of people worldwide
by offering products that maximize the benefits of natures
bounty
  farmland biodiversity helps nurture these gifts of nature
biodiversity is secured through proper ecosystem maintenance
with regard to farmland forest and other natural settings as a
food company kagome knows the extreme importance of eco               a tomato farm maintained by kagome

systems and biodiversity highquality crops can be grown only
on farmland that is host to the healthy existence of a diversity
of life the ongoing viability of such farmland depends on us
human beings
  protecting ecosystems and biodiversitythis will continue to
be one of kagomes most significant commitments



   promoting sustainable agriculture through contract cultivation
in japan kagome produces tomatoes used as ingredients
in juice and other processed products through contract
cultivation
  in contract tomato cultivation purchase prices are deter
mined through negotiations with contract farmers before cul
tivation even begins after harvest kagome purchases the full
yield from the contract farms to ensure yield levels kagome
provides the farmers with tomato seeds and seedlings and
offers cultivation guidance this frees farmers to concentrate          juice tomato cultivation policy explanatory meeting for
on cultivation and in turn to stabilize their farm management        contract farmers

  in recent years japan is seeing its population of farm
ers aging with advancing age farm maintenance becomes
more difficult in response kagome is promoting technologi
cal advances toward automated harvesting moreover we
are accelerating the development of easytoharvest tomato
varieties such as those whose hull remains on the stem when
picked by helping lessen the physical burden on farmers we
are helping farmers to continue cultivating tomatoes
  farmland biodiversity can be maintained only through proper
use and management therefore by supporting farmers in                 tomato harvester

remaining in tomato businesses kagome is helping to curb the
increase in farmland lying fallow while contributing to the sus
tainability of farmland that supports rich ecosystems

   specific guidelines for chemical fertilizer use
    we promote soil development with a minimal use of chemi

      as compost and green manure
    we analyze soil prior to initiating tomato cultivation based
      on analysis results we provide guidance on how to plan
      fertilizer application suitable for particular soils later
      through growth diagnosis based on tomato leaf and fruit
      development we decide on the optimal dose of fertilizers                   kagome field man providing cultivation guidance

   biodiversity protection




   effective maintenance and utilization of genetic resources
the kagome research institute maintains genetic informa                  diseaseresistant tomato varieties that require less agrochemi
tion database that includes the seeds of approximately 7500              cal usage
tomato varietiesa size that makes it a worldleading private
sector database to establish this database we collected the
seeds of tomato varieties with distinctive genetic characteris
tics drawing on this database we promote plant breeding to
create new useful tomato varieties
  these seeds are stored at a specified temperature and
humidity however aging deteriorates their germination rates            tomato seeds                            tomato seed library at the kagome

therefore they are periodically updated these meticulous
steps are required to maintain our genetic information data
base on tomatoes certain genetic information on wild and
other tomato varieties is provided to public and other research
institutions as such the kagome research institute functions
somewhat like a gene bank
  also we reevaluate the genetic information that we collect            wideranging tomato varieties created
the results of such reevaluations are used to develop new                 based on our rich genetic resources




   eliminating the use of nonindigenous bee species for pollination
kagome started the production and sale of fresh tabletop
tomatoes in 1998 unlike tomatoes for processed products
which are grown outdoors tabletop tomatoes are grown inside
greenhouses where wind pollination is not possible and so we
use bees for pollination in may 2004 immediately after the
nonindigenous bumblebees we had been using were desig
nated an invasive alien species we replaced the entire stock             kagomes mega greenhouse

with native black bumblebees at the three greenhouses in
japan under our direct control our five other greenhouses
constructed after these three have used the native bees from
the start at the time no largescale breeding technologies
had been established for these native bees kagome sup
ported technological development even though the native
bees impact on tomato quality and economic viability was not             native black bumblebees

then clear the relevant technologies have since been devel
oped and today such bees are supplied for tomato cultivation
throughout japan

message saying thank you for flattening appeared on the top             tainer after you finish it youll see a nice message when i did
side it was really nice and left me with a warm feeling i think        so a message saying thank you for flattening appeared and
that individual consumers have to give serious thought to todays         made us both smile although i always wash cut and flatten milk

reminded me of the importance of beginning                                i find myself just throwing paper veg
with what i can do myself such as sorting                                etable juice boxes into the garbage
and flattening every container i dispose of                               without even removing the straw
to reduce waste bulk this message has                                    from now on i will be more careful

heat source the co2 produced during combustion is recov
ered and effectively utilized to aid photosynthesis which is
essential to tomato growth supplementing this the company
also uses liquefied co2 derived from the emissions of external
petrochemical and oil refinery companies which further facili

efforts aimed at effectively using natural energy sources for
example we satisfy a portion of the electricity needs of the
hibikinada greenfarm by sourcing electricity from a nearby
largescale solar power plant
 water resource conservation
kagome promotes the effective utilization and recycling of                                                                 co2 produced by lp gas to heat green

reuse of nutriculture and culture media and other materials
