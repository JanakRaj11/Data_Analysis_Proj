aalto university is a member of the international sustainable campus network iscn and complies with the report
ing charter endorsed by the iscn which specifically emphasises teaching research and artistic activities this report
utilises the iscns three core principles as tools for reporting on aalto universitys responsibility and sustainable
development the universitys focus areas teaching and research principle 3 are reported on first followed by
the environmental principle 1 and indirect impacts of campuses principle 2



principle 3
teaching research and societal impact
teaching and learning

aalto universitys objective is to integrate responsibility and sustainable development into all teaching and learning
the objectives laid down for 2016 included a survey of how responsibility and sustainable development are evident
in the objectives of the universitys degree programmes a report on the learning objectives of bachelors degree
programmes revealed that the objectives are most commonly related to the students understanding and ability to
adapt his or her learning to the societal and ethical context in addition the objectives may be related to the content
of a particular field of science for example sustainable use and processing of natural resources are contentrelated
focus areas at the school of chemical engineering

another aalto university objective for 2016 was to create a module for the internal education of teachers that will lower
the threshold for the integration of responsibility and sustainable development into teaching responsibility and sustain
able development can be part of the practices of teaching and learning or part of content the possibility to use exist
ing support materials that have been developed by eg tek and sitra to support teachers was also examined the
university was unable to establish an actual education programme over the year but the themes as well as aalto experts
and areas of expertise were assessed as part of unofficial network meetings a morning coffee event for the teachers
sustainable development network was organised three times in 2016 the objective for 2017 is to integrate responsibility
and sustainable development into the broader code of conduct for all employees

aalto universitys range of courses includes special courses the names of which include the terms responsibility
 sustainable development andor environment meaning protection of the environment in addition to this numerous
other courses have content related to the theme in 2016 a new online course was developed which is intended for all
aalto students and highlights the challenges related to sustainable development as well as aalto universitys expertise
in finding solutions to these challenges the course will be piloted in spring 2017 there are also numerous masters
degree programmes at aalto university that centre on sustainable development and responsibility in 2017 two new
multidisciplinary masters programmes that are strongly linked to the theme of sustainable development will begin
advanced energy solutions and advanced materials for innovation and sustainability eit raw materials aalto
university also offers courses related to the theme through its partnering institutions

many of the universitys student projects also produce new information and applications that promote sustainable
development and responsibility

 students taking part in aalto universitys creative sustainability masters degree programmes design
  for government course developed new ideas for improving the circular economy the students created solutions 		
  for three challenges a reduction in the amount of electronic waste the motivation of building cooperatives in saving 		
  and maintaining energy and the improvement of transport in sparsely populated areas the clients were the ministry 		
  of the environment and the ministry of transport and communications

 students taking the advanced project design course designed and built a solar power charged electric bicycle 		
   the solar chargeable bicycle is a demo version which resembles a threewheel cargo bike solar panels have been 		
   placed on the rear rack of the bicycle it was found in practice that if use of the bicycle relied entirely on solar energy 		
   the batteries had to be charged up using larger panels the solar panel on the bicycle produces a small amount of 		
   energy and it takes a long time to charge up the batteries


research and artistic activities

responsibility and sustainable development are apparent in the themes content and results as well as in the processes
and practices of aalto universitys research and artistic activities aalto universitys strategy emphasises a multidisciplinary
approach and societal impact based on its research work aalto creates expertise and new solutions that are part of
the universitys scope of influence and activities for the good of society in 2016 aalto university selected the production
of sustainable development and consumption as one of its key multidisciplinary research profiles in its funding application
to the academy of finland aaltos disciplines in sustainable development and the quality of research were examined for
the application based on this work the research community has committed to the theme and is building a multidisciplinary
research portfolio around sustainable development

numerous research groups that focus on the research areas of responsibility and sustainable development operate in
all of aalto universitys schools also the universitys artistic activities include numerous projects in which responsibility
and sustainable development form the core

 professor herbert sixta has led the development of ioncellf an environmentallyfriendly and nontoxic method
  that will revolutionise the recycling of cotton the method will make it possible to dissolve cotton waste utilising an ionic
  solvent developed at the university of helsinki ioncellf won the hm conscious global change award competition 		
  which sought out new textile industry ideas that facilitate sustainable development vtt technical research centre of
  finland ltd was responsible for the development of the method used for the preprocessing of cotton waste

 together with a group of international researchers assistant professor matti kummu developed a new type of
  method with which to analyse the mekong rivers water flow measurements and examined the waters solids content in
  19812005 the research shows the changes to the route and intensity of storms that hit the that hit the drainage basins
  on the upper course of the river far from the delta must be taken into account when assessing the vulnerability of deltas
  as the ocean surface rises

 in his doctoral dissertation robin stitzing researched the effects of the car tax reform on the markets the
  environment and care sales according to the study the ecofriendly car tax reform had only a small impact on the sales
  driven carbon dioxide emissions that decisionmakers thought were important because at the same time the eu set
  carbon dioxide limits for car manufacturers a car tax based on carbon dioxide emissions increased local pollution
  because it favoured cars that run on diesel carbon dioxide emissions from diesel engines are smaller but their local
  polluting emissions are greater than those of petrol engines so carbon dioxide emissions based car tax favoured them

 the results of research by professor robin ras can in future be utilised eg in prevention of biofouling professor
  ras received the nearly eur 2 million erc consolidator grant from the european research council erc for his
  superslippery liquidrepellent surfaces project the objective of the fiveyear project is to produce new types of
  surfaces and promote their potential use in various technological applications
