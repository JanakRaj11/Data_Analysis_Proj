      down in our procurement guidelines we inform suppliers of specific requirements in 2013 we intend to
      expand the sustainability requirements for suppliers that are currently in force in the different divisions and
      merge them into a single guideline

      linde has also implemented a global process to record evaluate and communicate safety health
      environment and quality incidents worldwide nearmisses from which the group can learn lessons for the
      future are also recorded in this way in 2012 the group circulated 38 information sheets internally with a
      description of the relevant incident or nearmiss the main reasons for its occurrence and the measures
      introduced as a result in addition we prepare global risk avoidance plans these are designed to protect
      employees and neighbours as well as the groups property and information

      alongside safety indicators we measure resource consumption and environmental impact at all sites around
      the globe we thereby maintain a steady focus on efficient business practices and on minimising the
      ecological impact of our operations between 2008 and 2012 we conducted around 1000 environmental
      protection projects of which 300 were during the reporting year areas of particular priority in 2012 included

      kilometres driven decreased again in the year under review to 0075 2011 0077 as part of the global
      package of improvement measures for transport safety we have set ourselves four goals

           to adopt all local and global minimum operating standards for transport and integrate them into the
           groups global standards database

           to provide our employees and transport contractors concerned with training in these revised standards
           to introduce an audit programme to verify compliance with these operating standards
           to implement a new behavioural safety training for drivers entitled actsafe for drivers

        incidents by 2017                             received training by the end of 2012 over 20 percent of drivers
                                                      employed by linde and contractors participated in the new
      actsafe training courses within pilot projects since 2009 in the course of 2012 we also trained and certified
      40 transport auditors

      we also provide practical rollover prevention training for drivers of heavy goods vehicles which we extended
      to eastern europe and south africa during the year under review it is scheduled for implementation in brazil
      and india during 2014 linde also set itself a new global transport safety target during the reporting year to
      halve the frequency rate of serious transport incidents by the end of 2017 in comparison with 2012 figures


      we systematically promote safe transport practices at linde since 2007 our subsidiary in china has
      presented annual awards to drivers with the years best safety records for instance the group also works
      closely with communities and authorities on transport safety in 2012 for example linde joined forces with

      strategy
      we rely on innovative technologies and the efficient use of energy in order to conserve resources and reduce
      greenhouse gases while remaining commercially successful our global energy management system provides
      the basis for this we conduct internal audits to analyse the energy efficiency of our plants and processes
      across the globe potential for cost savings is exploited where technically and economically feasible
      electricity and natural gas jointly account for about 80 percent of the energy carriers linde uses the

      production of air gases in air separation plants accounts for the greatest share of the groups electricity
      consumption over 85 percent this is why we particularly focus on improving energy efficiency and

      energy consumption and efficiency
      compared with last year energy overall consumed by linde decreased slightly this was attributable in
      particular to changes in customer demand we identified around 190 projects during the reporting year to
      reduce our energy needs these projects resulted in savings of approximately eur 28 million and around
      180000 tonnes of co 2 emissions

      in 2012 linde emitted around 159 million tonnes of greenhouse gases 2011 169 million tonnes
      worldwide the decrease in direct greenhouse gas emissions relative to 2011 is mainly due to a change in
      customer demand with regard to climate protection measures in our business processes we focus in
      particular on the areas responsible for the bulk of our co 2 emissions or where we identify an opportunity to
      make substantial cuts in emissions these areas include the groups air separation plants and product

      lindes indirect co 2 emissions by 2013 our global goal is therefore to improve the installed design energy
      intensity of our air separation plants per air gas produced by 3 percent relative to the reference year 2008
      so far we have achieved savings of over 1 million tonnes of co 2 in 2013 we extended this goal to a 5
      percent improvement between 2008 and 2017 which has the potential to save over 25 million tonnes of co 2
      additionally in 2013 we have set ourselves a new global target for our installed hydrogen hyco plants
      aiming for a 2 percent increase in their actual energy efficiency by 2015 compared with the 2009 level


      alongside production we also examine other links in the value chain for their climate protection potential 
      for example transport activities we implement a wide range of measures to reduce emissions caused by the
      transport of our products these include optimised routing improved capacity planning and training courses

      million cubic metres this water is used in manufacturing products as a source of steam and in office
      buildings as well as continuous flow systems we also make use of closedloop systems in which the water
      can be used several times this means that only a small amount needs to be replaced depending on the

      waste



      we work continuously to reduce and avoid waste where possible waste products are recycled the rest is
      disposed of in an environmentally sound manner in compliance with local regulations we classify the waste




                                                                                                                        about linde
      generated by our business activities as hazardous or nonhazardous in line with national legislation lindes
      main waste products are oil and oleaginous materials chemicals waste containing metal and gas cylinders
      most gas cylinders are fully recycled at the end of their useful life closedloop systems for products help to
      increase material and resource efficiency and to cut the volume of waste produced lime slurry for example a
      byproduct of acetylene production can be used in other industries with no further treatment required

      volume of hazardous waste particularly as a result of various waste treatment measures in africa for
      instance initiatives to increase the recycling share had the effect of reducing the volume of waste for
      disposal by around 40 percent compared with the prioryear figure

      our waste management targets are determined by regional requirements as the type of waste produced
      differs significantly from one site to another depending on the processes being carried out in the uk for
      instance linde has set a regional target of increasing its waste recycling rate to 65 percent by 2014 having
      already achieved 55 percent during the year under review since 2008 waste management efforts there have

      saved around eur 240000

      during 2012 we analysed volumes of waste generated and total wasterelated costs at several hundred
      sites as a followup initiative we launched a pilot project in southeast asia at the beginning of 2013 to
      evaluate improvement potential in waste management and identify bestpractice sites                              measuring sustainability

      in 2012 the number of workrelated accidents at linde resulting in a lost working day was cut further to 13
      2011 14 per million hours worked during the same period the number of workrelated accidents among

      deepest regret that the group must report that three linde employees and four workers employed by
      contractors lost their lives whilst working for the group during the reporting year six of these fatalities
      occurred in relation to transport activities and one employee lost her life in a car accident

      1 other energy sources include for example heating oil biofuel energy propane and butane the increased consumption of other energies in 2011 resulted from the inclusion of additional
        other energy sources eg naphtha and methanol into the indicator scope
      2 water use in 2012 increased due to newly installed air separation plants in china which mainly use sea water in their processes
      3 water consumption relates to drinking water and industrial water used oncethrough water is drawn from a natural or other sources solely warmed and ultimately piped back to the
        original source at a temperature not posing any risk to the surrounding ecosystem

      assurance on sustainability information and that they comply with the requirements of the code of ethics for
      professional accountants of the international federation of accountants to ensure their independence



      work undertaken
      our procedures included the following


         a risk analysis including a media search to identify relevant corporate responsibility issues for linde in
         the reporting period
         reviewing the suitability of the internal reporting criteria including conversion factors used
         evaluating the design and implementation of the systems and processes for the collection processing and
         control of the data for the selected environmental and safety indicators including the consolidation of this
         data
         interviews with relevant staff at corporate and regional levels responsible for carrying out internal control
         procedures on the data and consolidating the data for the selected environmental and safety indicators
         visits to five selected production sites in germany 2 hungary 1 and thailand 2 and four selected
         regions respectively divisions in europe 3 and asia 1 to review the source data and the design and
         implementation of validation procedures at local level
         evaluating internal and external documentation based on sampling to determine whether the data for
         the selected environmental and safety indicators together with the related explanatory information is
         supported by sufficient evidence
         an analytical review of the data and trend explanations submitted by all production sites for consolidation
         at group level


      during the assurance process we discussed the necessary changes in the report and reviewed the final
      version of the report to ensure that it reflects our findings



      conclusion
      based on the procedures performed as described above nothing has come to our attention to indicate that
      the 2012 data for selected environmental and safety indicators listed in the section scope together with the
      related explanatory information are not presented in all material respects in accordance with the reporting
      criteria



      emphasis of matter
      without qualifying our conclusion above we draw attention to the explanation on the scope of the emissions
      to air and water which explains that the values stated apply to production sites legally obliged to report
