enels remuneration policy is consistent with the recommendations of the corporate governance code and aims to i at
tract motivate and keep those persons that have the skills to manage the company successfully ii incentivize the achieve
ment of the strategic objectives and the sustainable growth of the company iii align the interests of management to the
primary objective of creating sustainable value for shareholders in the long term and iv promote the corporate mission and
values in defining the policy adopted by enel spa on remuneration for the members of the board of directors the chief
executive officergeneral manager and executives with strategic responsibilities in reference to 2017 the nomination and
compensation committee took account of the recommendations contained in the corporate governance code best nation
al and international practice and the indications that emerged from the approval by the shareholders meeting in 2016 of the
remuneration report


in particular the variable remuneration for the chief executive officergeneral manager is made up of


 a shortterm variable component mbo which considers both internal financial indicators such as consolidated
   net income from continuing operations the ratio between operating cash flows ffo  funds from operations
   and net financial debt and value of consolidated cash cost and nonfinancial indicators such as occupational
   health and safety
 a longterm variable component lti which considers both enels average tsr total shareholder return com
   pared to the average tsr of the euro stoxx utilities emu index over a 3year period and the groups accumu
   lated roace return on average capital employed for the same 3year period


in addition the bonus plan envisages the deferment of the payment of longterm variable remuneration specifically 30 of
the total is paid during the year subsequent to the 3year performance period the socalled control year while the payment
of the remaining part 70 of the total is deferred by two years compared to the 3year period thus making de facto com
pletion of the plan last over a 5year time horizon

          analysis of counterparties
the ability to adequately assess counterparties and to promptly intercept any threats and risk elements is increasingly an
essential requirement not only to protect organizations reputation but also for their very survival
the analysis of the counterparties is requested by the business lines departments and services the request is facilitated
and supported by an instrument and by a methodology provided by the security unit which at the same time is responsible
for formally verifying and optimizing the operations requested
even if the analysis may also be assigned to third parties the process and the methodology must guarantee the application
of a criterion for standard assessment monitoring and reporting


the analysts are required to collect all the relevant information regarding the reputation of the subjects involved within
the defined scope this work is carried out by making searches from all sources which are open private and available
including at least internet  social networks public administration  chamber of commerce public database of the judicial
system corporate database paying attention not to violate the companys policiesprocedures or the laws of the country for
example protection of personal data antitrust laws etc international databases for example world check

enels commitment on human rights
enel is aware of the fact that a company is responsible for the respect of human rights not only in the actions which involve
it directly but more generally also indirectly in the context in which it operates as required by the guidelines and on the
basis of policy principles the human rights compliance assessment hrca project is continuing in the various countries
through the establishment of multifunction and multicountry work groups which enable the definition of global policies and
their exposition while taking into account local situations as part of the work to define the groups priorities see analysis of
priorities various stakeholders are asked their opinion on human rights in various aspects in general enels policy focuses
on two fundamental areas labor practices and relations with communities




the new due diligence process

during 2016 enel redesigned its due diligence process in order to align it to international best practice focusing the analysis
at first on the perceived risk assessment for human rights in the various areas where the group operates
in particular the process envisages 5 stages


1 assessment of the country risk on labor rights
2 assessment of the country risk on rights of the community and the environment
3 impact assessment
4 development of an action plan
5 monitoring of the plan and remedies


during 2016 enel designed the aforementioned process through the involvement of representatives of the various countries

sustainability plan 20172019
we are seeing major transformations in our reference framework which are taking place ever more quickly and offer the
energy sector new challenges and opportunities they are interconnected changes which are reflected in a new global sce
nario characterized by a technological and digital revolution by growth in the population and its expectations in a context of
climate change and pressure on the use of natural resources
in a world which is growing in terms of its energy needs there is ever greater penetration of electric vehicles energy con
sumption is increasing but with still more than 1 billion people who do not have access to energy or have limited access
renewables are the energy source which is growing most strongly while the others are stable or falling slightly distributed
generation plays an increasingly important role and in this context electricity networks both for transmission and distribu
tion are ever more important and various industrial sectors are converging on them thus de facto changing the competitive
context
so it is increasingly important not only to be aware of and anticipate technological developments but also what society
around us wants thus ensuring that communities understand and share the strategy and investments which a large group
such as enel can provide


in relation to this context enel has identified some key emerging risks


 cyber security which represents an essential element in the digital transformation plan enel has developed a
     strategy aimed at protecting information assets and emerging technologies for example iot in this context a
     dedicated unit has been created and a new operating framework has been defined in order to unify management
     of the issue with a risk based strategy and to disseminate security by design practices launching training and
     awarenessraising projects
 the paradigmatic change in the world of energy and the transformation in utilities business model new macro
     economic and energy trends technologies and key players can potentially support and disintermediate the tradi
     tional business model of utilities in particular the combination of factors linked to digitalization and decentraliza
     tion and changes in customer needs enels strategy and the open power vision are the reference framework to
     respond to the challenge of the transition towards becoming the utility of the future


the main trends the emerging risks the stakeholder engagement and enels strategy all enable the preparation of enels
priority matrix the socalled materiality analysis the matrix which has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines of
the most common international standards such as the global reporting initiative gri represents the priorities among the
issues of interest to stakeholders crosschecking them with the industrial strategy and with the groups priority actions see
the chapter defining priorities


in order to respond in a sustainable and flexible way to this context enels business model is based on a strategic plan bro
ken down into four main pillars from the industrial and the environmental social and governance esg viewpoints these
pillars are flanked by digitalization and customer focus as levers to promote further growth and efficiency

in 2015 enel adopted a creating shared value csv model which integrates social and environmental factors into business
processes and throughout the value chain the dissemination of this model required a process of definition and consolidation
within the company at both cultural and operational level in 2016 policy no 211 csv process definition and management
was published which defines how sustainability must cut across company processes and be a shared responsibility

rethinking the relationship with communities in the canaries in puerto del rosario


the thermoelectric plant of las salinas is a diesel powered generation plant consisting of 12 units with net installed capacity of 160
mw which is currently being modernized it is in the municipality of puerto del rosario the capital of the island of fuerteventura
in the canary isles spain and has been in operation since 1992 when the first production unit was connected to the network
the presence of urban centers near the las salinas facility has required particular handling of the relationship with the
community the plants operation has in fact in the past triggered complaints from citizens about the noise levels and the
emissions caused by the generators despite many of the local homes having been built subsequent to the startup of the
plant and the plants emission levels conforming to spanish environmental laws
with the aim of improving the relationship with the local community in a spirit of transparency and development of the local
area a short and mediumterm csv plan was drawn up through meetings with the main stakeholders and with the city
and district associations as well as thanks to analyses of the socioeconomic and political context the main issues were
recorded for the local area on the basis of which the csv plan was drafted


for 2016 as the first year three areas for action were identified


 1 open plants actions aimed at opening up the plant to the local context with measures aimed at disseminating
   knowledge of the world of energy and of the company at facilitating dialogue with citizens and at promoting
   visits to the plant and educational programs in schools
 2 access to energy for people living in poverty programs were developed for energy volunteering involving
   25 families through 20 volunteers and training programs for social services in order to optimize invoicing and
   energy efficiency in agreement with the local institutions other initiatives are also being drawn up to protect the
   most vulnerable categories
 3 socioeconomic development two initiatives have been drawn up actívate y empléate and art energythe
   first is aimed at young people at risk of social exclusion and offers employment opportunities while the second
   is an urban art competition realized in collaboration with the municipality eight endesa transformer stations have
   been made available as well as the wall of the plant to be decorated with murals painted by local artists and schools

the gas powered plant in malacas has installed capacity of 286 mw and is located in the province of talara in the north of
peru in order to increase its efficiency it was decided to build a new 51 mw tg6 unit which will take the place of other
more obsolete units which are currently in operation malacas is the first plant on which the creating shared value csv
model has been applied to move from the business development stage of the new unit to the current ec stage the results
of the analyses as well as the csv plan with the related capex and opex of the various projects identified were an integral
part of the assessment of the business project approved by the investment committee
from the analysis of the socioeconomic and environmental context launched in the design stage and from the profound
knowledge of the stakeholders which has consolidated over the years of operation of the plant the following priority issues
emerged protecting the environment which is seriously impacted by waste the promotion of local entrepreneurship also
in response to the high unemployment rate and womens empowerment the csv plan drawn up to address these shared
priorities includes various initiatives aimed at improving the quality of life in the long term among the early results record

máncora beach hotels trained 30 students in 2016 12 of whom found employment the olitas verdes program which
seeks to promote tourism in the area and is aimed at young people held educational workshops on the reuse and recycling
of waste and on plans to collect and sell waste from beaches and from areas around the plant in addition in agreement with
the municipalities a plan was drawn up to transform the pallets used on site into beach infrastructures thus increasing the
safety of the shoreline and providing more structures for water sports
in addition in order to guarantee the utmost transparency towards stakeholders during the construction works an informa
tion panel was installed about the realization of the new tg6 unit at the same time summarizing the various ongoing social
and environmental projects

rethinking the relationship with communities at torrevaldaliga nord


enel has a very important role for the local communities present in the area around the torrevaldaliga nord plant in civitavec
chia and for many years has supported initiatives to protect the environment the health and local development the innova
tive csv approach adopted by enel aims at a business model which recognizes the strategic value of the interdependence
between the company and the social environmental and economic context in which it operates and has strengthened in
the company the belief that its role must thus take the form of a contribution to the development of the local communities
also from the business viewpoint with a view to creating shared value
in 2016 this belief took the form of the search for sustainable initiatives which can generate lasting benefits over time for
the communities the first step was an accurate and detailed analysis of the context single event effect criticality analysis 
seeca followed by intensive work to consult all stakeholders in order to identify the intervention areas which are perceived
as priorities by the local communities and which offer potential development opportunities for all the local area
then at the end of 2016 innovative agreements were signed with each of the four municipalities involved allumiere santa
marinella tarquinia tolfa which define collaboration aimed at a process of inclusive and sustainable growth in the local area in
addition the agreements set out the shared value initiatives which enel intends to develop together with the local administra
tions also through forms of partnership with businesses andor nonprofit associations which are active locally


in particular great attention was paid to the issue of resilience with training programs and initiatives aimed at the adoption by
the local administrations of a development plan for the town compatible with the environment to be safeguarded and protected
again with a view to creating shared value actions are envisaged to increase the efficiency of public lighting and to pro
mote sustainable transport through the realization of a public cycle path for electric bikes with networks of recharging
points smart hubs and video surveillance
in addition educational films are envisaged aimed at creating new technical and business skills initiatives in favor of
the disabled and the recovery of sporting structures
this model marks an important turningpoint in the means of managing relations with local administrations in the territories
where enel is present with power plants and is ready to be adopted also in other areas starting from the federico ii plant
in brindisi where the process which was started at the end of 2016 will be developed during 2017

 2 support activities for young people projects in collaboration with schools to offer the possibility to students of
   taking part in cultural and sporting activities by improving leisure facilities and digital inclusion activities
 3 boost to rural business most of the rural producers in goiás are organized in cooperatives and have problems
   marketing their production and managing their business in this light the following were planned
         a the construction of a communication platform and internet access in order to include small rural producers in the
         large scale market and to promote business skills
         b the installation of batteries to stabilize energy consumption and to facilitate production processes

energy efficiency improves life in the district of los piletones


in buenos aires in the district of los piletones the electrification project was started with the installation of smart meters
which enable more efficient use of the network and customers in a poor highly unstable area the district is characterized
by a high percentage of foreign communities over 60 by a very high rate of occasional employment equal to 75 and
by residents 63 of whom receive state subsidies where 50 of homes do not have hot water in such a difficult context
the socioenvironmental analysis undertaken during the planning of the installation of the meters recorded as priority urgent
issues access to energy protecting the health and safety of the communities mitigation of the environmental impact and
local economic development


in order to address these needs while generating at the same time stable conditions for the network the following initia

the mexican way to cooperation between industry and agriculture


in mexico enel green power signed a collaboration project with the autonomous university of chapingo with the aim of
strengthening productive skills in particular in the agricultural and forestry sector and in research into sustainable irrigation
systems in the chinampas majoma and primero de mayo communities located near various wind farms which are at the
business development stage such as villanueva or at the construction stage such as palo alto with 129 mw and vientos del
altiplano with 100 mw
for years now the company has been working to identify and finalize solutions aimed at applying a positive sum model for
both the renewable industry and for local farmers starting from the experience in oaxaca where wind farms coincide with
farming areas the collaboration with the autonomous university of chapingo is a step forward in making the agricultural
areas of the rural communities around our plants more productive and sustainable from the environmental viewpoint
thanks to the analyses of the socioenvironmental context undertaken during the planning stage of the plant of vientos del
altiplano in the area affected by the plant a project has been established which envisages a plan to recover and identify new
areas to be used for agriculture and includes the study of a system to collect rainwater in addition it is planned to create
together with the community six school allotments for the cultivation of medicinal plants vegetables and high value agricul
tural produce in order to seek new market opportunities
in addition since the availability of water is a critical factor for the development of agriculture in the region mainly due to the
high salinity levels a possible treatment is being studied to replace rainwater agriculture with irrigation based agriculture

which is characterized by the historic presence of the indigenous pehuenche populations the pehuenche population in the
area affected by the plants with 12 communities consisting of over 1500 families numbers around 7 thousand people
during 2016 the relationship with these communities was mainly focused on two negotiating groups with representatives of
the families who have complained about the impact of sitio 53 and other working groups dedicated to the planning of ini
tiatives for local development the communities involved in these activities were pitril callaqui el avellano aukiñ wallmapu
quepuca ralco ralco lepoy el barco and ayin mapu the negotiations were conducted in accordance with the principles of
transparency and access to information at the end of december 2016 the negotiations were still ongoing with the parties
showing themselves willing to find a solution these opportunities for dialogue saw the active involvement of executives
nominated by the communities and of the enel generación chile group which operates in the local area and which includes
people from the sustainability and operations areas
among the development programs which emerged from the dialogue with these communities we may highlight the launch
of new business initiatives in particular the production transformation and sale of local produce such as cherries jams
hazelnuts and their derivatives the activity which was based on the transfer of analytical and technological tools involved

a second case was brought between august 2011 and december 2012 by inhabitants and companiesassociations from
the five towns of huila for alleged damage in relation to the closure of a bridge paso el colegio in relation to the socalled
acciones populares in 2008 some local inhabitants started proceedings to ask among other things for suspension of the
environmental license a further acción popular was launched by some fishing companies in relation to the alleged impact of
the refilling of the el quimbo basin on fishing in the betania basin downstream from el quimbo in february 2015 the court
ordered the suspension of the refilling until some specific requirements were met
the suspension was subsequently modified thus allowing the filling of the basin which started on june 30 2015 however
on july 17 2015 emgesa received a notice modifying the precautionary measure to prohibit generation activities until anla
the national environmental authority certifies that the company has removed biomass and forest waste from the quimbo
reservoir basin
pending the ruling as an energy emergency had been declared the ministry of energy issued a decree authorizing emgesa
to begin electricity generation subsequently on december 16 2015 the constitutional court ruled that the presidential de
cree was unconstitutional and as from that date emgesa suspended electricity generation
on december 24 2015 the ministerio de minas y energía and the aunap agriculture and fishing authority filed a joint
motion acción de tutela asking the criminal court to authorize generation as a precautionary measure on january 8 2016
the court granted the precautionary measure requested by the ministry and the aunap authorizing the temporary and im
mediate production of energy at the el quimbo plant the precautionary measure granted by the court would remain in force
until the huila court issued a ruling on the substance of the case ie on the revocation or upholding of the precautionary
measure previously issued by the local administrative court with a decision of february 22 2016 the huila court issued a
ruling allowing generation to continue for six months the court ordered emgesa to prepare a technical design that would
ensure compliance with the oxygen level requirements and to provide collateral of about 20000000000 colombian pesos
around 55 million euro with the decision of the administrative court of huila of april 11 2016 the temporary withdrawal
of the precautionary measure was once again confirmed for six months up to october 16 2016 a deadline which was then
extended again for a further six months as from february 2017 in this time period emgesa will have to show that the system
of oxygenation used allows attainment of the oxygen levels imposed

processes the process follows a series of agreements signed between 2012 and 2014 and dialogue with the chilean government
to take part in the relocation plan for the families who used to live in the areas around the power plant which were then declared
uninhabitable following a study by sernageomin  servicio nacional de geología y minería following the earthquake in 2010 this
led to the signing of the agreement mentioned previously in 2012 and to the consequent establishment of a publicprivate work
group during march the families had the chance to receive housing subsidies and in september signed the purchase agreements
for their new homes in particular programs were defined for environmental and social recovery including the project relating
to the parque urbano coronel to create parks and sports areas around the plant during 2016 the energía para tu emprendimiento
energy for your entrepreneurship program continued to promote a relationship based on the development of people and the crea
tion of shared value also thanks to the establishment of a fund to support entrepreneurship this fund has allowed small business
owners to enhance their knowhow to create relations with local industry and develop a network the fund for 2016 of 300 million
chilean pesos around 420 thousand euro enabled the financing of 73 individual production projects which were able to count on
the support and consultancy of experts six months after the investment monitoring will be undertaken of each initiative in order to
understand the real impact on small business another important initiative is the fondo de valor compartido fund for the creation
of shared value which with an allocation of 180 million chilean pesos around 250 thousand euro aims to support projects for the
community over the whole useful life of the bocamina plant

the dome of bocamina ii
in august 2016 enel generación started the construction of the first dome for the storage of coal in chile in the area north
of the second unit of the bocamina plant this system covers 22300 m2 of surface area measures 51 meters in height and
has a capacity of 150 thousand tons it enables improvement in the logistics for the handling of coal and guarantees for the
nearby communities compliance with environmental standards the dome consists of a selfsupporting metal structure
which is light and adaptable to the type of land characteristics which enable it to be built quickly and with low impact the
same technological innovation will be applied in the storage area to the south of the plant the activation of this project joins
other environmental improvements made by the company thanks to an investment of around 102 million us dollars which
make the bocamina plant one of those which operate in accordance with the highest standards in this field aligned to all the
rules and permissions required by the environmental authorities

today the group can therefore count worldwide on plants powered by renewable sources for around 36 gw of net capacity
which represent 43 of the groups electricity generation assets

the removal from the scope of consolidation in july 2016 of slovenské elektrárne entailed a reduction in installed capacity
from thermoelectric and nuclear plants of around 24 gw and the removal of around 16 gw of installed capacity from the
hydroelectric sector in order to favor growth a new development model was launched called bso build sell and op
erate which is not so capital intensive and will further accelerate the development of enels broad portfolio of projects in
renewable sources worldwide the reduction in the net installed capacity on wind and geothermal plants in the united states
and canada around 1 gw is for example due to the removal from the consolidation of some power plants




production

currently 46 of enels power generation comes from zero emission sources
the net energy produced by enel in 2016 of 262 twh fell by 222 twh compared to the value in 2015 78 due to the
lower quantity generated in italy 76 twh and abroad 146 twh in particular the reduction in the energy produced in italy
was mainly due to the fall in demand lower hydroelectric production and the greater unavailability of some thermoelectric
power plants owing to maintenance abroad the reduction involved the removal from the consolidation as from the end of
july of slovenské elektrárne the drought conditions in latin america owing to the el niño phenomenon as well as the

greater quantities of imported energy in spain as for the production mix the change was due mainly to the lower production
from coal 133 twh nuclear 64 twh and hydroelectric 59 twh these effects were partly offset by the higher gener
ation from wind 21 twh and solar 05 twh


the existing power plants enabled total production of around 86 twh from renewable sources during 2016 which represent
33 of the net energy produced by enel in 2016 31 in 2015 thus avoiding the atmospheric emission of around 56 million
tons of co2 the nuclear plants enabled the avoidance of a further 28 million tons of co2

the specific co2 emissions stood at 395 gkwheq in 2016 down compared to the figure for 2015 by over 3 due mainly
to the reduction in thermal production from coal in italy and spain compared to 2007 the base year for the definition of
enels reduction target to 2020 of specific co2 emissions this value fell by 15 compared to 1990 the base year for the
kyoto protocol the specific co2 emissions in other words those relating to the production of a single kwh of the enel
group fell by 36


over the years the reduction target for specific co2 emissions to 2020 has increased compared to the values in 2007 going
from 18 to 25 setting a target for that date to produce specific emissions below 350 g co2kwheq

operational environment

besides the aforementioned project in terms of adaptation enel started to map the environmental risks which include the
risks associated with climate change through the weighting of the vulnerability of production sites a pilot project for the
assessment of vulnerability was carried out at sites in iberia and latin america to identify and prioritize climatic events
which may impact on the operativity of the service the project initially on the basis of a unfccc method assessed natural
phenomena such as for example hurricanes which can represent a threat for the groups assets assessing the potential
associated risk and subsequently the capacity to adapt the plants to face the impacts of the phenomena analyzed to minimize
these risks in the long term enel has accelerated its decarbonization process developing new business opportunities in
the field of renewable sources energy efficiency and new digital technologies in the market for end uses among the
main opportunities the digitalization of networks the development of new products and services for energy efficiency for
consumers and the promotion of electric vehicles in the sectors of transport and residential use




carbon pricing

the process of strategic and industrial planning assesses the impact of the carbon price on operations and on short medi
um and longterm investment decisions decarbonization is one of the four strategic esg environmental social and gov
ernance pillars and consequently the investment choices in new capacity are automatically in line with the goal of keeping
the rise in the global temperature to below 2 c in this regard enels strategy is focused on the one hand on increasing
renewable capacity and on the other the gradual and selective reduction of the thermoelectric power plants present in
various countries for example in italy the future project aims to lead this transition with the widest possible involvement
of all those concerned
with reference to the medium term the groups strategic and industrial plan for 20172019 envisages investments in the
renewables sector of 52 billion euro and further growth in renewables through the development of the build sell and op
erate bso model the groups new renewable production capacity globally will be 67 gw by 2019 including both organic
growth 35 gw and the bso model 32 gw
as for the short term the internal reference price of co2 is set in the range of 713 t in keeping with the recommendation
internationally and with the orientations for the ets the shortterm prospects reflect regulatory scenarios and market ex
pectations and enable assessment of the impact of the price of co2 on enels operations

calculation is made of the quantity of co2 associated with the
electric consumption of the printers during printing applying the
emission coefficient data source enerdata of each country
which considers the specific mix of energy sources18


in the continuous search for economically sustainable optimization of processes enel is working on the realization of various
initiatives aimed at digitalizing the activities based on the use of paper among the main projects in 2016 were


 up paper for the digitalization of workrelated expense claims which has enabled around one million sheets
    fewer to be printed each year and reduced handling times
 online bills for the free market and for the protected market in italy it has reduced the issue of printed invoices
    thus obtaining significant benefits from an environmental viewpoint connected to lower paper consumption in
    2016 it is estimated that around 39 million fewer sheets were printed for invoicing on the free market and around
    18 million fewer sheets printed for invoicing on the protected market
 the online billing project in iberia enabled a reduction in the issue of printed invoices obtaining significant ben
    efits from an environmental viewpoint linked to lower paper consumption in 2016 it is estimated that there were
    around 108 million online invoices with a saving of around 216 million printed sheets
 the cero papel initiative in colombia for informed and responsible use of paper through the promotion of
    the use of digital instruments to file and disseminate information through awarenessraising campaigns on the
    improvements in terms of environmental impact following the reduction in paper use

   the tco2 produced in 2016 is higher than in 2015 by around 05 t although enel employees printed around 12 million sheets fewer in 2016 compared to
   2015 owing to the worsening emission coefficient gco2kwh for spain and italy in 2016 compared to 2015 data from enerdata on may 23 2016 if we
   calculated in 2016 the quantity of tco2 applying the same coefficient values gco2kwh as in 2015 for the various countries we would have obtained 2041
   tco2 instead of 2218 tco2

cyber security
in a context in which managing cyber risks which are continually growing has become a global priority for enel cyber secu
rity is an essential element of the digital strategy
the company as other key players in the electricity sector uses digitalized systems to manage its own generation plants
distribution network and relationship with customers business critical systems smart grids smart meters are increasingly
digitalized and integrated into the hitech panorama in addition the use of the internet of things is spreading and this leads
to the growing dissemination of devices in smart and interconnected environments and systems traditional it is evolving
towards mobile computing or cloud computing


the cyber security strategy is aligned with that of the enel group and is based on a pre
cise assessment of the possible risks and on the definition of the related cyber security
initiatives at global level it is defined with an iterative process which envisages the involve
ment of the various business areas gradually consolidating aspects such as the forecast
scenario for it security the objectives and strategic initiatives for security the cyber
security strategy is approved by the top management and then broken down into
operating plans for implementation of the planned initiatives the activities
are implemented with a security by design approach which focuses
on security aspects right from the first stages of the design of
applications systems and processes




           cyber security in figures
spending on cyber security during 2016 was over 10 million euro
dedicated people 66 people 51 men and 15 women in december 2016 58 in 2015


in 2016 the enel groups protection systems each day blocked around


 600 thousand incoming emails that were malware or spam
 800 viruses
 700 thousand incoming malware connection attempts


during 2016 on average 150 cyber security incidents were handled every day of varying degrees of severity and over 400
suspect domains were identified and notified which use the groups brand illegally as well as around 80 hostile actions
by hackers in addition 300 actions were undertaken for systematic checking ethical hacking of the protection level
achieved by it systems and applications

group assessment

in january 2016 the assessment was completed of the groups cyber security the assessment which was conducted in
conformity with key international standards nist nerc etc regarded it systems industrial control systems the organiza
tion processes and the practices adopted on the basis of the results of this work the necessary organizational and design
actions were identified




the new organizational model

in september 2016 the enel group redefined its organizational structure for the management of cyber security a specific
cyber security unit was created reporting directly to the chief information officer cio and whose head covers the role of
chief information security officer ciso of the enel group this has also made the decisionmaking chain more streamlined
and flexible in a context in which the speed of response to events is essential the unit is structured to manage the govern
ance and assurance of cyber security the definition and supervision of the architecture and systems of it security in a range
of contexts information technology industrial control systems and emerging technologies internet of things etc solu
tions and services for the prevention protection and response to any it attacks and the definition and supervision of systems
to manage ids and access control the new organizational structure envisages the involvement of the business lines in the
activities connected to cyber security through the figures of the risk managers and response managers




main actions and projects

in 2016 enel started the project to define the new cyber security framework which describes the processes for the man
agement of cyber security in the enel group in line with risk based and security by design approaches


2016 was also characterized by the launch of new and important projects for it security


 the introduction of the new system of identity access management compac which enables the activation of
   security policies for access verifying the compatibility of the assignment of each role with the rules dictated by
   the principle of the segregation of duties
 the creation of enels cyber emergency readiness team cert which is based in italy and with contact points in
   the main countries where enel is present with its assets and infrastructure during 2017 the project will lead to
   the official accreditation of the cert in the various group countries the existence of the cert allows supervision
   and monitoring of cyber security events on it systems and on industrial control systems and allows centralized
   coordination of the management of cyber security incidents as well as guaranteeing constant updating on the
   risks for it security and close collaboration with national and international organizations which deal with cyber
   security and with other certs
 the development and installation of a new generation of probes advanced deep packet inspection probes aimed
   at improving the capacity to record cyber security events
 the protection of web applications web application protection through advanced cyber security solutions
   through advanced services which allow the protection of information exchanged with visitors to websites im
   proving performance in terms of response time and mitigating the effects of any attacks aimed at interrupting the
   service ddos attacks

information and awarenessraising

during the year the ict security awareness program continued a permanent and continuous initiative at group level which
proposes to create and constantly promote a cyber security culture thus improving behavior in response to it threats and at
tacks which seek to exploit the habits and expectations of users the program envisages both campaigns on general themes
and specific initiatives linked to specific risks
the global cyber risks campaign november 2015december 2016 involved all the people who work in enel and was divided
into four themed modules risks deriving from the ease of connection security of data and information use of secure tech
nologies also outside of the workplace and security in the use of mobile devices




           main collaborations
in 2016 the active participation in standardization groups continued in particular in the international electrotechnical commis
sion tc57wg15 data and communication security on the theme of the cyber security by design approach to cyber security


in addition the support of the national observatory on cyber security resiliency and business continuity of electrical sys
tems continued a group of experts of which enel is a founding member which represents a reference point for research
initiatives in the field of critical electricity infrastructure
in september 2016 enel organized an international hackathon called hackathon cyber security a contest between the pro
posals of seven emerging companies to combat it attacks in four areas industrial control systems supervisory control and
data acquisition  scada internet of things iot data protection and protection of mobile devices the winning company
of the hackathon was involved in field testing of the proposed solution
collaboration was started with companies producing innovative it security solutions thus making it possible to influence their
development with the goal of maximizing the benefit that can be obtained from their use in the groups industrial context


finally enel supported the cyber security for infrastructure of the energy  transport cset 2016 observatory which was
held in genoa in june 2016

          circular economy in the sustainable 				
          supply chain
the circular economy is an economic
system which describes the steps to
be taken for sustainable reform of the
production of goods and services
as part of global procurement the
evolution towards a circular ap
proach requires profound knowl
edge of material flows in terms
of components environmental
impacts and the possibility of recy
cling products part of this context
is also the project on the environ
mental product declaration epd the
purpose of these declarations is to quantify
and present objective data water consumption
co2 soil atmospheric emissions etc relating to the whole life
cycle of our supplies which have never previously been defined in a standard way that allows comparisons to be drawn the
advantages from this process will concern the definition of reference benchmarks for the supplies that we acquire triggering
a continuous improvement process in both internal performance and that of our suppliers control of the groups environ
mental footprint and a reduction in costs as a result of the monitoring of consumption and the optimization of production
processes
the epd project falls within the work to operate sustainable worksites promoted by renewables and global thermal gen
eration as inputs and outputs of the system the sustainable worksite is a model for efforts to construct and restructure
plants where safeguarding the environment rational use of resources and a focus on health characterize every detail of the
daily work carried out the worksite model also envisages the constant monitoring of activities in terms of environmental
performance in order to generate continuous improvement mechanisms and realize a virtuous and effective collaboration
also with contractors and suppliers the adoption of innovative solutions on the worksite both in terms of materials and in
terms of engineering and infrastructure as well as the increasingly marked orientation towards the reuse of materials and
equipment confirm that enel is gradually shifting from a linear economy to a circular and more virtuous economy which puts
resources back into the production cycle instead of considering them as waste to be disposed of

purchasing fuel is a strategic activity for the group since it plays a leading role in guaranteeing the security and continuity
of thermal energy production the selection of fuel suppliers is done by assessing economic and financial aspects of the
counterparties and the possession of the technical and commercial prerequisites suitable counterparties are subsequently
included in specific vendor lists purchase contracts signed with such suppliers are subject to the rules adopted by the
group regarding the code of ethics and the zero tolerance of corruption plan to which suppliers must adhere


in relation to purchases by sea from the international market a check is made that suppliers are not on specific blacklists
of the un european union and the us office of foreign assets control lists which respectively identify individuals or or
ganizations connected with terrorist organizations organizations subject to financial sanctions by the eu and socalled sdn
specially designated nationals organizations which are subject to sanctions by the united states for accusations among
other things of terrorism or drugtrafficking finally in order to mitigate the risks from fuel transport by sea enel has adopted
a tool to assess and select the transporters used known as vetting vetting is a recognized industry standard for oil transport
but for some years enel and a small number of operators have started to apply the same methodology also in the sector of

spills
for 2016 the total quantity of the most important spills was around 22 m3 linked mainly to grid construction and maintenance




          spills as part of distribution
as part of the distribution of electricity possible environmental accidents derive mainly from the discharge of insulating mi
neral oil following breakdowns to equipment or vehicles or electrolyte acids in primary cabins except for rare cases of spills
from large transformers environmental accidents are mainly marked by small spills for which prompt intervention is envi
saged and subsequent environmental recovery by a specialist firm in accordance with the methods imposed by local law
for more careful safeguarding of the environment affected by the accident the parts of the plant potentially at risk of spills
and company vehicles are equipped with kits with absorbent material in order to isolate possible routes for further disper
sion in the case of an accident
to further mitigate the risk connected to holding potentially harmful substances from the environmental viewpoint various
tests are underway which envisage the use of vegetable  and therefore biodegradable  oil in place of the traditional insu
lating mineral oil

          as pontes
as pontes an open coal mine in the north west of spain has for many years powered the endesa power plant of puentes de
garcía rodríguez near la coruña in 2007 the mine was closed with the consensus of most of the population the workers
were reabsorbed into other companies and an extended program of environmental denaturalization started the program
was created with the aim of recreating the different stages of nature in the area meadows shrubbery wood so as to rec
reate habitats for vegetal and animal species the recovery operations envisaged the planting of 600 thousand trees and the
sowing of 130 tons of seeds among other initiatives
the mining area was filled naturally with the flow of rain water and with the water from the river eume and today there is an
artificial lake which is 205 meters deep and with a perimeter of 178 kilometers
the physical and chemical quality of the water has been monitored since 2008 and the observations have enabled verifica
tion of the gradual recolonization of the basin by local fish species such as the brown trout salmo trutta the threespined
tickleback gasterosteus aculeatus and the northern straightmouth nase pseudochondrostoma duriense
the overall effect on the biodiversity of the location has been considerable 168 animal species have been surveyed and
numerous species of flora have reappeared among the most important in terms of conservation are the iberian frog rana
iberica the little bustard tetrax tetrax the european otter lutra lutra and the iberian emerald lizard lacerta schreiberi
the as pontes project is a genuine global reference point for industrial reconversion in sustainable fashion

 adoption of elicord cabling consisting of three insu          lines this is due not only to the systematic introduction of

the materiality analysis 2016

the process followed for the materiality analysis 2016 envisaged the updating of the results of the analysis obtained in the
previous year the methodology adopted envisages the annual updating of the results from the involvement of stakeholders
and every two years the realization of new ad hoc engagement and listening activities in parallel to a possible revision of
the categories of stakeholders and of the issues subject to analysis should the sustainability context make it necessary
the materiality analysis was conducted on the basis of the guidelines in aa1000ses for the stages of mapping and prior
itizing stakeholders and analyzing the results and of the criteria of accountability and of the grig4 for the definition of key
issues and the application of the principle of materiality
the definition of the issues to be analyzed is based on various sources including the corporate policies and principles of
conduct dialogue with stakeholders the issues of greatest interest for sustainability rating agencies and relevant bench
marking studies


the following aspects were investigated in relation to these issues


 on the stakeholder side the relative importance of each issue in the perception of stakeholders and the direc
   tion of their expectations ie an expectation of engagement rather than disengagement on the part of enel to
   better understand the expectations of stakeholder during 2016 a pilot project was launched to monitor the level
   of satisfaction of stakeholders regarding the companys control of an issue
 on the company side the level of impact of the issues on industrial strategies determined on the basis of the
   current and future commitment taken on for each issue


in particular the results were integrated that emerged from numerous initiatives to listen to involve and talk to key stake
holders that enel undertook during 2016 together with a structured analysis of the positions independently expressed by
authoritative stakeholders such as national and transnational institutions authorities stakeholder associations and multi
lateral bodies on sustainability issues examples of the sources considered were customer satisfaction and customer com
plaints dealings with analysts and investors questionnaires from sustainability rating agencies dealings with representative
and category associations institutional relations at national and local level union relations media monitoring and surveys


the impact of the various issues on enels strategies was determined by involving the strategic planning unit and other com
pany functions for analyses on specific issues and was then confirmed by the chairman and the chief executive officer this
analysis reflects the strategic guidelines defined by the 20172019 strategic plan the objectives of the functionsdivisions
and the commitments taken on by the group through its policies and conduct criteria
analysis of these two aspects enabled the attribution of various priority levels for the issues and their positioning in a matrix
as set out in the specific chapter on the materiality analysis the materiality analysis summarizes the various perspectives
and provides an overview of the issues with the greatest potential to influence the actions and performance of enel and the
decisions of its stakeholders as well as the degree of alignment or misalignment between the priorities attributed by
stakeholders to the various issues and the groups level of commitment in this regard
below is the table of the issues included in the materiality analysis in the aspects of grig4 with the related indication of
the internal boundary and of the external boundary within the organization

1   the emissions avoided are calculated as the sum of the emissions avoided in the various areas taking as a reference the specific emission of co2 in
      the average thermoelectric production of the individual country taken from the enerdata database in april 2017 httpservicesenerdataeu
      the figure is the product of the electricity production obtained with each renewable or nuclear source by the average co2 emission from thermoe
      lectric production in the country where enel is present
2   specific emissions are calculated considering the total emissions from simple thermoelectric production and the combined production of electricity
      and heat with respect to total renewable simple thermal and nuclear production and the combined production of electricity and heat including the
      contribution from heat in mwh for minor pollutants such as metals including mercury enel has undertaken widescale measurement campaigns
      of the concentrations in rivers produced by thermoelectric power plants  in a range of situations by type of fuel and abatement system  obtaining
      results which comfortably respect the precise limits established by the laws in the various countries where enel operates in particular for mercury
      emissions which are typical of electricity produced from coal in 2016 a total of around 0396 tons was recorded only for italy and spain which currently
      represent 68 of thermoelectric production using coal throughout the group
      the mercury emissions are communicated to the competent authorities for registration in the european pollutant release and transfer register epr
      tr in application of eu regulation no 1662006 and are subject to associated controls in terms of completeness coherence and credibility article

      tion moving fuel extracting coal property management and since 2013 also the electricity purchased from the grid from hydroelectric plant is
      the product of the electricity consumption including grid losses multiplied by the respective weighted specific emission coefficients of the whole
      generation mix of the countries where the enel group operates source enerdata  httpservicesenerdataeu scope 3 the estimate of indirect
      emissions of co2 relating to 2016 and arising from the transport of coal by sea is calculated starting from the quantity transported equivalent to 68
      of the total coal used taking into consideration panamax ships with a 67600 ton capacity which cover average distances of 700 nautical miles in
      22 days consuming 35 tons of oil a day and an emission coefficient of 32 kg of co2 per liter of oil consumed considering also three days stopover
      for unloading to which consumption of 5 tons of oil is associated the estimate of the indirect emissions of co2 from rail transport of coal is calcu
      lated starting from the quantity transported equivalent to 32 of the coal used and taking into consideration trains with a capacity of 1100 tons
      which cover average distances of 1400 km with consumption of 69 kwht for each 100 km transported and an average emission coefficient of enel
      worldwide the estimate of the indirect emissions of co2 from the transport of consumable materials oil gas oil solid biomass wdf and waste is
      calculated starting from the quantities of raw materials transported taking into consideration trucks with capacity of 28 tons which cover average
      return distances of 75 km with consumption of 1 liter of gas oil for each 3 km travelled and an emission coefficient of 3 kg of co2 for each liter of gas
      oil consumed the figure is a rough estimate of the fugitive emissions of methane ch4 from the coal which is imported and used by the enel group
      for thermoelectric production the figure does not take into account the emissions due to the transport of lignite
4   the figure for 2015 and 2014 was restated to better consolidate the value
5   the values relating to current expenditures for waste disposal emission treatment and environmental restoration do not consider either insurance




performance indicators                                                                                                                                     253

       or environmental liability or the amortization for environmental protection investments since the current accounting system does not allow a reliable
       attribution to specific environmental items of the insurance premiums and the investments are set out as such since the related amortization has still
       not been uniquely coded

7    tax due for exceeding the limits of water discharge at the plants of reftinskaya and sredneuralskaya
8    the figure for 2016 confirms the gradual fall in this percentage owing to the progressive disposal in italy and spain of registered thermoelectric power
       plants the emas regulation is an eu regulation which is applied almost exclusively in europe and is not universally recognized internationally as
       instead iso 14001 is for this reason for some years enel has decided to certify its whole scope according to the criteria of the international standard
       iso 14001 requiring double verification also in accordance with the requirements of emas registration only for some power plants mainly ther
       moelectric located in italy in some cases when neither the certifications nor the registrations were widespread emas registration was promoted
       locally in regard to the communities instead of iso 14001 certification
9    in the calculation for absolute consumption and specific consumption of water the consumption of water for opencycle cooling is not included and
       nor is the plants consumption of renewable sources
10   the analyses are carried out on different groups of plant from year to year depending on the specific audit needs and therefore relate to differing
       power plant levels								
11   the figure for 2016 cannot be compared with previous years owing to the change in methodology in 2016 for the calculation of environmental fines
12   the values relating to solid nuclear waste lowmedium and high activity are recorded in tons in slovakia and in cubic meters in spain both figures
       are given since they cannot be summed together
       the trend in the quantities of radioactive waste produced depends on the maintenance work and fuel movements and therefore is subject to consi
       derable fluctuations over the years
13   the provision for nuclear decommissioning fell compared to 2013 mainly due to the reclassification under assets held for sale of the subsidiary slo
       venské elektrárne in 2013 the latter held a provision of 2175 million euro relating to the plants v1 and v2 at bohunice and emo 1 and 2 at mochovce
       and included a provision for the disposal of nuclear waste for 114 million euro a provision for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel for 1296 million euro
       and a provision for the dismantling of nuclear power plants for 765 million euro therefore at december 31 2014 the provision held solely the costs
       which will be incurred on disposal of the nuclear power plants by enresa a spanish public company entrusted with this task the figures for 2015 and
       2014 refer to endesa generación the 2013 figures include endesa generación and slovenské elektrárne
14   the cabling ratio is calculated by proportioning the km of cabled lines both underground and airborne insulated cables to the total km of lines
       the increase in the cabling ratio over the years is due to a general increase in terms of length of airborne and underground cable sections at the
       expense of bare conductors
       this results in not only the continuous and natural replacement of bare lv conductors with airborneunderground cables but also the more decisive
       adoption of the mv airborne cables with considerable benefits in terms of the resilience of the network and limiting the cutting of plants in parti
       cular in the distribution companies in latin america the increase in the cabling ratio is mainly due to the systematic introduction of the airborne lv
       cable which was already familiar but not previously much used
