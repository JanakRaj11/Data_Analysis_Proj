                                                              positioning edc for new global realities
                                                              the postcrisis world remains wrought with uncertainty
                                                              despite signs of economic and financial healing the key
                                                              characteristics of this new normal are financial volatility
                                                              subpar economic growth a twospeed world  with
                                                              emerging markets in the higher gear  and persistent
                                                              fiscal and financial stresses
                                                              in other words a difficult environment for edc and our
                                                              customers but one thing was clear for edc we needed
                                                              to position ourselves to cope with this new reality so
                                                              that we could continue to serve the shifting needs of
                                                              canadian exporters this meant putting more emphasis
                                                              on our financial sustainability strengthening our risk
                                                              management architecture helping companies seek new
                                                              trade opportunities and making significant technology
                                                              investments accordingly we made some big moves
                                                              in 2012 to build our capacity to serve more canadian
                                                              companies for years to come
                                                               first we moved a number of our business experts into
our technology group this had two major benefits this group is now better placed to make effective investments that
will anticipate the future needs of our customers especially smaller companies and transaction teams are able to focus
exclusively on execution and customer service elevating productivity and service standards
second we strengthened our risk management framework which is highly regarded but has historically been focused
mainly on financial risk the groups mandate elevated to the executive level was broadened to capture the full range
of enterprise risks that must be managed in todays world including operational and compliance risks we are also
developing an enhanced governance structure that touches both management and our board of directors
third we made financial sustainability a cornerstone of edcs corporate plan and its execution central to this
operating philosophy is a new longterm commitment to a productivity ratio administrative expenses to revenues of
25 per cent  low by most financial institution standards this framework commits edc to spending only 25 per cent of
every dollar earned on overhead costs and since our revenues capture a good sense of the value we are delivering to
exporters  that is what they pay us for our services  all canadians are getting good value from our mandate
these three organizational moves have better positioned us to help canadian companies take on the biggest game
changer of the new normal  that a rising share of international business opportunities will be in emerging markets
and often will demand that companies establish a local presence in those markets
that is why edc tracks very closely two key performance indicators namely canadian business we facilitate in
emerging markets and canadian investments we help companies establish in them during 2012 about onethird of
our business was in emerging markets a good sign that canadian companies are diversifying their business to grow
we also increasingly helped companies finance and protect their investments abroad as they seek to build a global
footprint creating new jobs here in canada
edcs results demonstrate that our 16 representations abroad and twopronged strategy  to facilitate canadian trade
and to help create new trade opportunities  are paying off for canada in 2012 we redoubled our efforts to bring
financing to promising foreign buyers with whom we can match new canadian suppliers in these trade creation
activities we work closely with the canadian trade commissioner services experienced international network each of
us bringing complementary strengths to the table

                                                                                                                                             messages from management
another good example of trade creation in action is our work in canadas cleantech sector which we had identified as
a new export opportunity in 2011 in 2012 we created a virtual team developed credit stretch parameters and signed
10 deals that will help commercialize some risky but ingenious clean technologies developed in canada we also set up
a full partnership with sustainable development technology canada to help feed our transaction pipeline
indeed edc has adopted a partnershippreferred philosophy in everything we do given that we are meant to
complement the private market not displace it we think partnership is the best way of ensuring that commercial
players can grow a trade finance business in the space where edc operates for that reason we actively encourage
our people to seek ways to share risks with other players in both the private and public sectors in 2012 we set up
agreements with more partners such as the international finance corporation and african exportimport bank to
create new trade opportunities for canadians and we worked more closely with bdc referring more small business
clients to each other
the other philosophy that embraces everything we do is our commitment to corporate social responsibility applying
adequate due diligence on corruption and bribery environmental and social impacts and human rights is becoming
more demanding as the world becomes more complex such preoccupations led us to strengthen our own code of
conduct and due diligence processes for international transactions in 2012
in these circumstances 2012 was a positive year for edc and its customers but we recognize the new normal has been
particularly stressful for small businesses many still rely on sales to the us and the strong canadian dollar is forcing
them to stretch to innovate and increase productivity
the number of small exporting companies has been declining in this environment yet they still represent more than
80 per cent of our customers
while edcs small business offering is already strong we have begun to review everything we do to ensure it is
as effective and accessible as possible in both insurance and lending we have also launched a major technology
investment program that will make our trade finance tools more selfserve in nature through the web to increase their
availability to small companies we are introducing small business performance metrics to track our progress more
closely on this front
im proud to say that despite all these challenges and increased complexity edc continues to make a real difference to
canadas exporting community  and that is ultimately thanks to our people
our board of directors 12 talented men and women from the private sector is highly engaged in these challenges and
provided superb advice along the way in particular i want to thank our outgoing chair jim dinning i can say without
hesitation that in his leadership of the board wideranging knowledge and commitment to edc he has been one of
the best chairs a corporation could desire
i also owe a special thanks to edcs executive team our new management structure meant that each had to stretch
and adapt in 2012 and they did so seamlessly and enthusiastically as usual they were fully supported by our 1250
employees who each year find ways to adapt to new conditions and innovate in our offerings through their resilience
persistence and pure hard work they help canadian exporters get the job done

                                                               markets are embracing csr more than ever
most organizations  ourselves included  link their csr policies to compliance  compliance with the requirements
of the oecd common approaches or the equator principles for example but many organizations are now recognizing
that a compliancebased approach is often not adequate the context has changed too much
we recognized that early on our csr approach has always been a combination of can we does this meet the
compliance test and should we is this the right thing to do in fact edc has evolved beyond compliance in
many areas of csr to a more principlesbased philosophy because today there are no simple recipes for csr every
situation is different since policies generally do not have explicit guidance for every situation we also need to develop
our own principles
ill give you an example indias billionplus people make up one of the biggest markets in the world and one with huge
opportunities for canadian expertise in several sectors this year we signed our first large infrastructure deal in india
when we participated in the syndicated financing of an aluminum smelter in madhya pradesh
this was quite an achievement meeting the ifc performance standards in emerging markets such as india can be
challenging and it was a long road getting there but by working with a project sponsor who was willing to embrace our
principles we were able to ensure the project satisfied international standards given the massive opportunities that a
country such as india has to offer we hope to participate with similar partners in many more of these transactions for
the benefit of canada
ultimately we can only be truly accountable for our own behaviour when were satisfied with our principles we look
for the same in the people with whom we shake hands  partners who apply the same csr principles
we have definitely seen the benefits of evolving our csr perspective and i believe we need to continue to move in this
direction to grow canadian trade in a responsible manner and meet the challenges ahead

2012 highlights in brief
last year we undertook a csr survey taking the pulse of our customers of more than 270 exporters to assess what
canadian exporters know about csr their level of commitment and to identify areas where edc can help key
learnings from the 270 respondents indicated that there is a relatively high level of commitment to csr but low

exercise to further clarify our own understanding of these risks and sharpen the procedures that help us manage them
and made efforts to raise awareness and educate our customers on the risk of corruption in international trade
our board of directors also convened a special discussion on csr issues in 2012 and decided to designate a director

transparency and disclosure




our disclosure policy governs the release of transactionspecific information more information on this policy and
these practices can be found here
our practice is to maximize the amount of publicly available nontransactional information that might be of interest to
stakeholders in this regard we fielded 94 enquiries from a wide variety of stakeholders in 2012
in general stakeholder enquiries focused on transparency around our due diligence process particularly with regard
to human rights and our environmental and social risk review process for support for loans intended as general
corporate financing on nonprojects in fact the review of corporations seeking financing for general corporate
purposes are subject to an environmental risk review and we will aim to publicly articulate more broadly the details of
that review process

stakeholder question
stakeholder question what standards do you use for the human rights assessment are they international human rights
obligations those set out in the guiding principles on business and human rights the ifc performance standards
edc response to assess social impacts we are guided by a number of international agreements including the
international finance corporation ifc performance standards the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises
the equator principles and the guiding principles on business and human rights the gps the gps provide
guidance to private sector enterprises on what is expected of them regarding respect for human rights it should be
noted that the gps are not a standard but guidance
all projects which are classified as category a  b excluding highincome oecd countries are reviewed against
the ifc performance standards the ifc has also recently amended its performance standards acknowledging the
responsibility of the private sector to respect human rights an overview of the amendments can be found here in
addition when undertaking a project risk review we review the host countrys overall human rights conditions and

in 2012 we undertook a major initiative to hear from
our customers on csr we polled approximately 1000
exporters and received more than 270 responses the
responses were revealing in a number of areas briefly
we learned that most of our customers regardless of
size consider csr as a medium or high priority few of
them had strategies to implement csr and respondents
indicated that they generally began their csr journey
from the perspective of sound corporate ethics results
also showed a low level of awareness of canadas anti
bribery legislation that said nearly half of respondents
have declined to participate or withdrawn from an
otherwise attractive business opportunity because of csr
concerns we will use these findings as guideposts to assist
our customers in the area of csr
we used a platform of 25 events to reach a wide
cross section of our stakeholder groups speaking
on csrrelated best practices and standards major
themes addressed included sustainable development
environmental standards implementing csr ethics anti

contributing to canadas economic performance
its been four years since the recession began while we are seeing definite signs of healing there is still a great deal
of uncertainty in the global economy this uncertainty which has carried on far longer than normal is being fed by
persistent fiscal and financial stresses geopolitical turmoil and unforeseeable interruptions to economic growth
in this context canadian exports came under pressure in 2012 with exports growing a modest 2 per cent economic
growth remained sluggish in key export markets including the us eu and japan a moderation in economic activity
throughout much of the emerging world also contributed to slower growth in canadian exports contributing to a drop
in demand for our services at the same time private sector capacity returned to the market in 2012 further trimming
the need for our services but a positive development for the canadian credit market edcs facilitation of canadian
direct investment abroad cdia grew in 2012 as overseas investments by canadian companies advanced by a solid 9
per cent on the year
the exports cdia and domestic business facilitated by edc in 2012 are estimated to have sustained 572 billion
in canadian gdp a drop of 14 per cent from the previous year the contribution to the canadian economy in 2012
remained significant representing 4 per cent of canadas total gdp in other words for every 1 in income earned
in canada during 2012 40 cents is attributable to our trade and investment facilitation the employment associated
with the business we facilitated in 2012 is estimated at 573773 fulltime equivalent jobs about 33 per cent of national
employment

environmental and social risk management
gri indicator  en 26 fs 4

our environmental and social risk management framework guides all of our business and is further underpinned by
various international agreements and standards information regarding our management of environmental and social
risks our key policy documents and our review processes can be found here
environmental reviews of lesscomplex transactions are the responsibility of our financing managers and underwriters
effective management of such reviews requires that all employees understand their roles and responsibilities as such
in 2012 we implemented a detailed online training module for underwriters and financing managers on our corporate
environmental social and disclosure policies this module was completed by more than 320 employees

international standards

equator principles
2012 was our first full year as a member of the equator principles ep
association steering committee the eps are currently undergoing substantial
revisions and we played an active role in 2012 in several of the ep working
groups helping to define the scope of the principles to what types of
business deals to which they should apply the approach to addressing
human rights following the release of the ruggie principles also known as
the guiding principles on business and human rights and how financial
institutions can improve their reporting and transparency
we also assisted in harmonizing practices between the export credit agency eca and ep association communities in
the application of the eps as a member of the ep steering committee we coled the consultation with industry clients
as part of the 2012 update process to the eps

oecd common approaches
in 2012 edc and other ecas that form the export credits group at the oecd concluded an update to the common
approaches an agreement among member ecas to ensure consistency of expectations and application with respect
to environmental and social review practices key changes are noted in human rights reviews on page 35

edc like most lenders in the eca and ep association communities uses the international finance corporation ifc
performance standards as the standard for benchmarking project transactions moreover the performance standards
form part of the government of canadas csr strategy building the canadian advantage a corporate social responsibility
csr strategy for the canadian international extractive sector
these international standards are the basis for our environmental and social reviews of large infrastructure projects
for example the ifc updated its sustainability framework as well as its performance standards and guidance notes in
2012 we began applying the performance standards to all new project transactions that require an environmental and
social review with a heightened focus on resource and energy efficiency the revisions also provided new thresholds for
requiring enhanced consideration and verification of greenhouse gas ghg data from clients and now require that
free and prior informed consent be obtained in certain circumstances affecting indigenous peoples

while brazils regulatory regime does not require a full environmental and social impact assessment for a project such

management structure of the company and their overall environmental management system this included meetings
with the projects environmental and social managers other company mills as well as potential fibre source feed
suppliers and gave us a better appreciation of site conditions and potential for environmental and social effects
some of the key environmental and social impacts we
considered and assessed included air quality and forest
plantation we reviewed the air quality for potential air
emissions from the combustion of biomass in boilers
and volatile organic compounds from the drying process
and forest plantation to ensure sustainable practices in

corporate financing
corporate loans differ from limitedrecourse ie project finance loans as corporate loans are made to an
established corporate entity and are typically used for a variety of purposes such as repayment of existing debt or
capital and operating expenditures from an environmental and social review perspective corporate loans are
generally not subject to the requirements of our environmental and social review directive or the oecd common
approaches as there is no underlying project being supported that said we do assess the environmental and social risks
of corporate financing loans
reviews for corporate loans take into account several factors such as the industry sector being supported the countries
in which the borrower operates the borrowers environmental and social track record including compliance with
applicable regulations and the borrowers corporate capacity to manage the environmental and social risks of its
operations read our profiles for examples of our corporate loan review

climate change
climate change has emerged as one of the leading global environmental and social issues recognizing this institutions
such as the ifc have put a renewed emphasis on climate change and greenhouse gas ghg accounting in their
updated policies and procedures
similarly in 2012 we developed a new internal procedure to address our commitments to climate change as identified
in our environmental and social risk management policy we designed the procedure to align with the requirements
of the ifc policy on environment and social sustainability and ifc performance standard 3 this procedure contains
specific review requirements for category a and category b projects which include
     xx ensuring the environmental and social documentation provided by the client provides an estimate of the
        projects aggregate carbon dioxide co2 equivalent ghg emissions including direct emissions from
        the facilities within the physical project boundary as well as indirect emissions associated with the offsite
        production of energy used by the project
     xx ensuring that quantification of ghg emissions has been conducted in accordance with internationally
        recognized methodologies and good practice such as the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc
        or other methodologies deemed to be appropriate and
     xx for projects that are expected to or currently produce more than 25000 tonnes of co equivalent annually
                                                                                                   2
        we will confirm that the project environmental and social assessment or supporting documentation has
        considered alternatives and implement technically and financially feasible and costeffective options to reduce
        projectrelated ghg emissions during the design and operation of the project

in 2012 our team of environmental advisors received an intensive oneday training session from a leading ghg
accounting firm to increase their knowledge and capacity to apply ghg accounting and methodologies

assessment process improvements
last year we continued to evolve and refine our approach to human rights due diligence and developed an
increasingly structured approach to assessing human rights impacts prior to this exercise we applied multiple
approaches for human rights assessments depending on the product and sector in 2012 we assessed the subsequent
inconsistencies and inefficiencies and will revise our process in 2013
the review confirmed that we are taking into account the relevant human risks in relation to our transactions as such
we are able to share our expertise and methodology with our peers as one way of promoting a level playing field with
respect to due diligence we continue to develop our inhouse capacity on human rights which has enabled us to
contribute in a meaningful way to policy discussions among equator principles financial institutions and oecd export
credit agencies ecas

human rights reviews
as per our statement on human rights we screen the business we facilitate for potential impacts on human rights in
2012 the following human rights reviews were carried out
projectrelated all but one category a and b projects in nonoecd countries were subject to a human rights
assessment this included one category a project and two category b projects these figures reflect the nonoecd
projects financed in 2012 where human rights impacts can be of greater concern
nonprojectrelated these transactions are preliminarily screened by edcs financing managers and underwriters
using csr criteria to identify circumstances where human rights risks may be elevated this process offers us the
opportunity to determine the depth of the human rights assessment required for transactions based on the nature of
the edc product eg accounts receivables insurance political risk insurance financing contract insurance  bonding
or an equity investment and the country of risk the table below provides examples of our country categorizations for

international developments
human rights in the international context continued to evolve throughout 2012 revisions to international standards
continued to raise the bar of human rights due diligence in 2012 for example the revised ifc performance standards
were introduced and edc as well as many other oecd ecas and equator principles financial institutions began
applying them to projects the 2012 revisions recognized human rights as a crosscutting issue that can be effectively
addressed throughout the broad economic social and cultural areas of the performance standards for private sector
business in addition when undertaking a project risk review we review the host countrys overall human rights
conditions and document areas where a countrys existing human rights situation may overlap with the projects social
impacts
the oecd common approaches were also revised in 2012 at a high level the common approaches now explicitly
recognize the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises the guiding principles on business and human
rights implementing the protect respect and remedy framework and the international labour organizations
declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work among other technical issues oecd practitioners were
mandated to include further consideration to the issue of projectrelated human rights impacts to improve common
practices develop guidance and promote a level playing field examples of the types of activities practitioners are
undertaking in developing a body of experience include identifying sharing experience and arranging training on
relevant hrrelated international standards tools and methodologies and sharing experience on hr transaction due
diligence at the country and sector level edc is actively contributing to this work
in 2013 we will work to refine our methodology and integrate human rights into a common csr risk rating
methodology for nonproject transactions this will mean increasing internal human rights due diligence training
and overall benchstrength we will also continue to contribute to the technical human rightsrelated work of oecd
practitioners and equator principles financial institutions

operational footprint

in january 2012 our head office in ottawa was granted leed for core and shell gold certification by the canadian
green building council many measures were undertaken during the design and construction phases to ensure the
efficiency of the buildings mechanical systems the use of sustainable materials and the maximal diversion of waste
from landfill by using highefficiency mechanical systems and lighting the building was able to achieve 56 per cent
reduction against the model national energy code both local and recycled construction materials were used and
measures were taken so that 75 per cent of construction waste was diverted away from landfill indoor environmental
quality was assured through the widespread use of lowvoc paints coatings carpets and a highperformance
ventilation system
we are expecting to receive leed gold certification for commercial interiors in 2013

our footprint
while the move to our new head office presents many opportunities for reducing our footprint it did require that
we establish a new baseline in order to measure our operational footprint for example at the end of 2012 separate
metering devices were installed in the data centre allowing power usage to be tracked for that area by separating
the amount of power consumed we can accurately compare generic office space power consumption with other
institutions therefore 2012 remained a transitional year and in 2013 we will establish the first fullyear baseline for
our head office energy measurement
our green team a crosscorporate volunteer employee advocacy group that provides a forum to develop new
ideas undertook several new initiatives in 2012 to help employees understand the required attention to the 3rs
reducereuserecycle in order to help achieve leed gold certification for our building operations measures
were introduced such as organic recycling for select items and the creation of internal champions to promote an
environmentally conscious workplace
in 2013 we will measure and manage the buildings waste stream

awarding scholarships to canadian students with a demonstrated interest in international business as students benefit

more than 1 million has been invested in more than 300 scholarships since the program started in 2000 to assess the
impact of our investment we conducted a tracking study of our international business scholarship recipients dating
back to 2000 to learn to what extent scholarship recipients have built a career related to international business the
study gave us a sense of the many avenues our awardees use to pursue international trade from direct involvement to
running their own business to public sector influence all of which help to create more trade for canada
2012 was the first year we opened the competition to community college applicants we awarded 30 scholarships of
4000 each to canadian international business students representing 21 different universities one college and five

employee engagement
gri indicator  la 13

like many industrialized countries canada is facing a
tightened labour market where skilled workers will be in
short supply this makes the ability to attract and retain
highly skilled knowledge workers more important than
ever
with this in mind in 2012 we completed a
comprehensive examination considering the future
of work our evolving business environment as well as
workforce and legislative trends in order to ensure
we can continue to provide the best possible service to
canadian exporters and investors we then began the
design of a sustainable workforce planning program to
ensure that we continue to have the right people with the
right skills in the right place at the right time

independent limited assurance report to the board of directors and management of
export development canada on the selected information presented in the companys 2011
corporate social responsibility report

we have been engaged by the management of export development canada the company or edc to
perform an independent limited assurance engagement in respect of the selected information presented in
the 2012 corporate social responsibility report as hosted on the companys website 1 for the year ended
31 december 2012 the selected information the selected information has been identified in the
attached table labelled attachment a this engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team
including individuals with environmental social economic and assurance experience we were not
engaged to report on comparative figures for the prior year ended 31 december 2011

responsibilities of management

management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the selected information incorporated
in the 2012 corporate social responsibility report in accordance with the reporting criteria this
responsibility includes

           designing implementing and maintaining internal controls over information relevant to the
             preparation of a corporate social responsibility report that is free from material misstatements
             whether due to fraud or error
           developing the reporting policies and criteria
           preparing the selected information in accordance with the reporting policies and criteria and
           the content of the corporate social responsibility report

our responsibility

our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the selected information based on the
limited assurance procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained

we conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with international standard on assurance
engagements 3000 assurance engagements other than audits and reviews of historical financial
information issued by the international auditing and assurance standards board isae 3000 that
standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the engagement to
obtain limited assurance about whether the selected information on which we are reporting is free of
material misstatement whether due to fraud or error




1
  the maintenance and integrity of edcs website is the responsibility of management the work carried out by pricewaterhousecoopers does not
involve consideration of these matters and accordingly pricewaterhousecoopers accepts no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to
the reported corporate social responsibility information or criteria since they were initially presented on the website

t 1 416 863 1133 f 1 416 365 8215 wwwpwccomca
pwc refers to pricewaterhousecoopers llp an ontario limited liability partnership which is a member firm of pricewaterhousecoopers international limited each member
firm of which is a separate legal entity

a limited assurance engagement undertaken in accordance with isae 3000 involves assessing the
suitability in the circumstances of edcs use of the reporting policies and criteria as the basis for the
preparation of the selected information assessing the risks of material misstatement of the selected
information responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances and evaluating the overall
presentation of the selected information

a limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in
relation to both the assessment of risks of material misstatement and the procedures performed in
response to the assessed risks

the procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and primarily comprised

       making enquiries of relevant edc management and staff responsible for data collection and
         reporting
       reviewing relevant documents and records on a sample basis
       obtaining an understanding of edcs control environment and processes relevant to the selected
         information
       limited testing on a selective basis of the measurement recording and collation of the selected
         information prepared by edc
       evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies and agreeing or
         reconciling with underlying corporate social responsibility accounting records and
       evaluating whether edcs methods for developing estimates are appropriate and have been
         consistently applied however our procedures did not include testing the data on which the
         estimates are based or separately developing our own estimates against which to evaluate edcs
         estimates

the procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and are less in extent than in
a reasonable assurance engagement as a result the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance
engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a
reasonable assurance engagement accordingly we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about
whether the companys selected information has been prepared in all material respects in accordance
with the reporting policies and criteria

inherent limitations of the subject matter

nonfinancial performance information is subject to more inherent limitations than financial information
given the characteristics of the subject matter and the methods used for determining such information
the absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw allows for the selection of
different but acceptable measurement techniques which can result in materially different measurements
and can impact comparability the precision of different measurement techniques may also vary
furthermore the nature and methods used to determine such information as well as the measurement
criteria and the precision thereof may change over time

we have not carried out any work on data reported for prior reporting periods nor in respect of future
projections and targets we have not conducted any work outside of the agreed scope and therefore
restrict our conclusion to the identified selected information




                                                                                                         2

limited assurance conclusion

on the basis of the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained nothing has come
to our attention that causes us to believe that the selected information for the year ended 31 december
2012 is not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the reporting policies and criteria

restriction on use

this report including the conclusion has been prepared for the board of directors and management of
edc as a body to assist management in reporting on the groups corporate social responsibility
performance and activities we permit the disclosure of this report within the corporate social
responsibility report for the year ended 31 december 2012 to enable management to demonstrate that
they have discharged their governance responsibilities by commissioning an independent assurance report
on the selected information contained in the corporate social responsibility report to the fullest extent
permitted by law we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than management as a body
and edc for our work or this report save where terms are expressly agreed and with our prior consent in
writing
