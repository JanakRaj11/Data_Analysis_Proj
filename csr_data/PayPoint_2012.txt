short and longterm incentives are structured so as to align
directors interests with those of shareholders by rewarding
them for enhancing shareholder value it should be noted

the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the
degree to which the associated performance conditions have

that substantial rewards are only received when value has been
created in the business
