challenges
and opportunities
50 years ahead with you




we insist sometimes until we are exhausted on following
paths that are not the easiest ones because we do not like to
reach the conclusion that something really is impossible
 we will continue to grow and invest in portugal but to
achieve our ambition of what we believe sonae should be
in 50 years time there is absolutely no way that this will not
involve major international expansion

paulo azevedo

the growth of sonae over the last fifty years has always
gone hand in hand with a visible concern for environmental
social and ethical issues

over this time period the world has changed considerably and thus sonae has had
to be able to anticipate react and innovate while always respecting society and the
environment in which operates

over the past year we have continued to do business with the goal of achieving
economic growth and at the same time contributing towards social progress and
improving our environmental performance this goal means that on a daily basis we
are faced with taking decisions that are complex and not always easy nonetheless
these decisions are always founded on responsible and ethical principles

as the biggest private employer in portugal we are aware of our responsibility to
ensure and continually strengthen our actions aimed at improving the well being of
our employees and generally at creating a more harmonious society

in view of the number of citizens with whom we interact
each day we are aware of our capacity to influence society
to adopt a more responsible attitude

this power to influence can only be effectively used if we sonae are also able to
set an example to that end we signed up for example to the hivaids code of
practice which strengthens our rules in terms of the conduct and work conditions
of employees we rose to the challenge launched by the united nations concerning
our endorsement of the human rights declaration on its 60th anniversary and
sent a clear message about the respect that we have for all citizens

environmental protection is also one of the cornerstones
of our mode of operation

determined to protect the environment that we all share we have continued to
implement strategies that enabled us to monitor consumption of water and
energy as well as waste generated

aware of the influence that we can have on our business chain we maintained
active communication and involvement with our stakeholders to ensure a
relationship of confidence we also continue our involvement with the
communities among which we operate by identifying specific needs that exist and
by investing in initiatives relating to them that promote social harmony

we are conscious that the next few years will bring major
challenges nonetheless we take a realistic and confident
position believing that the sustainability strategy that we
have been building over the years will strengthen our
ability to face challenges and difficulties

the current international situation shows that companies with a strong
environmental social and ethical sense of responsibility are those that achieve
durable success as far as we are concerned we commit to raise our standards to
even more demanding levels

growth 1




sonaes turnover increased 21 in 2008 despite the
economic slowdown that occurred across the world

the retail business growth strategy was based
on organic expansion and on taking advantage
selectively of opportunities for acquisition

the shopping centre business continued to grow
internationally while in the telecommunications
business the focus was on improving network
quality customer service and the initial phase of
implementation of the fibre optic network

co2 emissions  each of the subholdings calculates this key indicator
using methodologies and factors that are appropriate to its business
activities and which are available for consultation in their sustainability
reports it should be noted that the reported emissions refer to activities
within scopes 1 and 2 of the ghg protocol in scope 1 emissions from
fuel used for vehicle fleets and equipment in business units are included
while scope 2 covers emissions from electricity production sonae
sierra monitors and reports emissions covering scope 3 activities in its
sustainability report from suppler and visitor vehicles and employee
travel in 2008 these emissions totalled 870229 tco2 an increase of
214 compared to the previous year also to be noted is the fact that
the figures for 2006 and 2007 are different from those published in last
years report due to the revaluation of data reported by sonae sierra
