details of the companys strategy are included in the chief
executives review on page 3 the companys approach to
corporate social responsibility and an analysis of risks facing
the company is set out in separate statements on pages 12
and 15 respectively

economic climate
the companys bill and general payments sector which accounts
for 41 2010 43 of our net revenue has continued to
be resilient as consumers discretion in expenditure is limited
for essential services and our service continues to be popular
utility providers in the uk continue to install new prepay gas
and electricity meters which will have a beneficial impact on our
transaction volumes the internet payment market continues
to grow substantially there has been an adverse impact on
our mobile topups as mobile operators continue to offer more
airtime at lower cost in the uk and to promote prepay less than
contract paybyphone is able to offer parking authorities a more
cost effective collection system for parking compared to pay and
display machines this has led to an increase in the number
of tenders being issued as parking authorities try to reduce
their costs

short and longterm incentives are structured so as to align
directors interests with those of shareholders by rewarding
them for enhancing shareholder value it should be noted
that the real value received by the executive directors under
the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the
degree to which the associated performance conditions have
been satisfied at the end of the three year performance period
and the share price of the company at this time this ensures
that substantial rewards are only received when value has been
created in the business
