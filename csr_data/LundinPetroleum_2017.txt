    our corporate responsibility
    approach

    a ground breaking year
    2016 was an exceptional year for lundin petroleum
    in many respects including from a corporate
    responsibility perspective for the first time we
    published a standalone sustainability report our
    corporate responsibility work has been reflected in
    our annual reports from the start but publishing a
    sustainability report based on the global reporting
    initiative g4 guidelines brought the active participation
    of everyone in the company from our board
    of directors to our corporate and country based
    management and our operational staff

    over time various sustainability standards and
    reporting procedures have been developed and we
    decided to align ourselves with standards which have
    been recognised internationally as to provide the
    information in a format that enables stakeholders to
    assess the companys sustainability performance

    with this sustainability report lundin petroleums
    corporate responsibility work can now be measured            we provide the market with oil
    against our peers leading to a more constructive
    dialogue with our stakeholders                             that is produced responsibly

    we engaged throughout the year with stakeholders            2016 was a very active year from an operational
    on this issue understanding the implications of the        perspective in february 2016 we tragically lost one

     climate change
     our carbon intensity on edvard
     grieg is among the lowest in
     the industry


     meeting the energy needs of the future
     global warming is one of the greatest challenges of
     our time requiring sharp reductions in anthropogenic
     greenhouse gas emissions at the same time the
     demand for energy continues to grow particularly in
     asia the challenge is therefore to produce more energy
     at lower carbon intensity

     the 2c scenario defined by the international energy
     agency iea sees global energy demand increasing by
     2040 with a slight decrease in oil consumption and a
     higher gas output but oil and gas are also important
     feedstocks for chemicals plastic raw materials and other
     finished products and demand for these will also rise
     with the expected growth in population and prosperity
     oil and gas provide nearly 60 percent of the worlds
     energy and will continue to make up a large part of the
     demand for decades to come

     the challenge that lies ahead will be to develop and
     produce oil and gas in the most energy efﬁcient and
     environmentally responsible way while increasing the
     share of renewable energy sources

     towards a low carbon society
     the united nations cop21 climate summit in paris
     adopted ambitious climate targets while the goal of
     preventing the average global temperature from rising
     beyond 2c still stands it was agreed to seek to bring
     the increase down towards 15c

     the paris agreement also specifies that the climate goals
     must be reached in a way which does not undermine
     employment and prosperity between 2050 and 2100
     greenhouse gas emissions should not exceed the level
     which can be absorbed naturally and through carbon
     capture and storage ccs this provides the framework
     for tomorrows lowemission society

     long as we are able to control pressure and relatively
     low temperatures with rising temperatures the
     hydrates convert into gas expanding to a volume

36   cggs topseis broadband seismic acquisition concept
     lundin petroleum sustainability report 2016

developing new seismic technology
what initially started as an idea from one of lundin
norways geophysicists has now been transformed
into a new marketready technology for seismic data
imaging over the course of several years we have
worked with the geoscience company cgg to develop a
completely new acquisition solution named topseis
this new solution provides a significantly better image
of the subsurface and hence overcomes the inability of
previous methods to image shallow geological features
such as faults gas pockets channels and stratigraphic    developing topseis has been a win
pinchouts by overcoming these shortcomings
topseis enables exploration and development teams        win for lundin norway and cgg it has

highquality data delivered at a lower cost compared to
other seismic acquisition techniques
                                                          lundin norway that addresses the

source is placed in front of the streamers and is towed
by the same seismic vessel and results in a large part

of the signal reflections not being recorded seabed      halvor jahre
seismic where the streamers are placed directly on the   exploration manager at lundin norway
seabed and the source is towed above partly solves
these challenges but comes at a higher cost

topseis is a method involving two seismic vessels        topseis provides a detailed and quantitative depiction
operating in tandem by placing the signal sources of     of the reservoirs and is particularly wellsuited for
one of the boats directly over the cables instead of in   relatively shallow oil and gas fields such as those in
front of them this yields more signal reflection than    the southern barents sea this will reduce the risk
with conventional seismic acquisition this allows us     associated with drilling and improve the chance of
to examine the subsurface with ten to fifteen times       finding oil and gas the acquisition method also makes
more signal energy to achieve this the streamers must   it possible to cover a large area in a single operation
be towed at a sufficient depth in the water so that the   and is therefore much more costeffective than seabed
vessel with the streamer can sail over them without       seismic
interfering with the cables an operation previously
considered impossible                                    cgg announced the launch of topseis at ons 2016

                                                          intrinsic lack of near offsets inherent in 3d towed
