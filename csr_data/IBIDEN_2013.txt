undergoing sustainable management assessment
in order to realize and maintain csr management it is essential not only to conduct internal evaluations and
audits but also to assess our activities from an objective viewpoint to this end the company undergoes an
external assessment every two years and strives to improve on the credibility of the csr activities it promotes
   in response to the results of thesustainable management assessmentwhich was conducted by a non
profit organization npo the sustainable management forum of japan smf in march 2012 we pushed
forward with improvement activities we changed the way we disclose information and started more clearly
presenting various activity policies particularly in areas of social development and the environment
sustainable management assessment the requirements of iso 26000 are taken into account and the level of activities
 pertaining to areas such as management environment and social development including governance is evaluated while the
 evidence proof andor rationale is verified mutually


corporate evaluation by external organizations
the company conducts gap analyses betweenwhat it should beand the results of external corporate eval
uations our csr promotion division analyzes the data obtained from important survey questions and
discusses the course of action with departments involved to identify elements that are lacking at the compa
ny furthermore if it is possible to improve upon these elements during the next fiscal year each department
develops strategies within its action policy
   for fiscal year 2012 our focus was on the improvement of efforts particularly for life cycle assessment in
the area of the environment we also proceeded with preparations for obtaining evidence that enables us to
explain the parts where indicators are insufficient including evaluation of personnel affairs and the status of
response to water risk

csrrelated audits
we respond to csrrelated audits conducted by thirdparty organizations based on customer requirement
   the results of audits similarly undergo the process of gap analysis to establish the difference between the
global industryrequired standards and the company      s current efforts and to identify issues that need to be
addressed we take to heart the suggested issues put forward during these audits and strive to improve upon
them by analyzing the causes and implementing corrective actions as well as preventative measures further
more we are working toward creating a system that meets the global standards by improving upon these
issues
   in fiscal year 2012 we underwent audits by thirdparty organizations for the first time in japan and the re
sults of audit indicate that our csr structure is lowrisk the audit results are attributable to our efforts to fully
understand requirements and promote reviewing the system so that human rights can be observed in other
regions as well as we developed further our human rights activities in asia we will handle items that require
attention concerning human rights in such a way that violations do not occur under mechanisms of regulations
and guidelines and establish a structure under which the items can be checked by an internal audit

compliance companywide promotional committee
in august 2003 the compliance companywide promotional committee headed by the president was formed
in an effort to bolster compliancerelated awareness across the group the committee carries out groupwide
procompliance activities and reviews such undertakings compliancerelated policies and plans decided by
the committee are communicated to each plant which in turn rolls out individual actions in accordance with
them all group companies both in japan and abroad have set up their own compliance organizations man
dated to formulate and conduct individual actions
    the compliance companywide promotional committee is held twice a year in fiscal year 2012 the com
mittee was held in may and november each plant of ibiden confirms the progress in its activity goals and
plan established at the beginning of the fiscal year at the compliance promotional committee at each plant
held periodically every month other group companies also review activity goals periodically

standards for employee behavior
the group has long since stepped up its commitment to compliance fol
lowing the introduction of the ibiden standards for employee behavior 
employeescode of conduct as our overseas operations rapidly expand
with the construction of plants in the philippines china france and hun
gary we must now ensure compliance with international rules as well as
with laws and regulations prevailing in the countries where we do busi
ness recognizing this the group undertook a full review of its compliance
program to improve the framework and revised the ibiden standards for
employee behavior in fiscal year 2003
   at the group all officers and employees are determined to respect the
standards for employee behavior and create a group of companies that
are good corporate citizens in the eyes of the international community            we have established the ibiden
                                                                                   standards for employee behavior
                                                                                   which serve as compliance guidelines
revision to the standards for employee behavior                                    for officers and employees

the ibiden standards for employee behavior are continually evolving in light of the globalization of our ex
panding business operations taking into consideration the expectations of our stakeholders we add and
revise provisions on worker rights with which we must comply as internal standards we have also established
the standards for employee behavior based on such international standards at our main production plants
overseas and we are making efforts to provide thorough education on human rights and ethics according to
these standards
    upon the revision of the ibiden group charter of behavior in fiscal year 2011 ibiden reorganize the code
of conduct so that employees who must comply with it can understand it more easily and we continue our
efforts to promote their compliance

compliance training
when promoting compliance activities it is crucial that employee aware
ness is continuously maintained at a high level
    the company runs a broad array of education programs including lev
elspecific and workplacespecific training designed to enhance employee
awareness of the importance of compliance these programs include
group discussions on causes of violations of the employeescode of con
duct and actions taken in response to the violations they educate every
single trainee in consciously deciding on the right action in a given situa
tion
    we also enable new employees to deepen their understanding of csr              csr training for new employee is
                                                                                   conducted to deepen employees
and what violation of compliance is through discussions based on familiar          understanding of compliance through
cases                                                                             familiar case example


establishment of educational system and enhancement of educational programs
all employees of the company took compliance education programs attendance rate 100 however im
provement of awareness through repeated education is necessary to make employees thoroughly understand
the importance of compliance in fiscal year 2012 we reviewed csr compliance training as our levelspecific
education and established a system that enables all ibiden employees to undergo training periodically we
prepare programs after clarifying the subjects of training and purposes of implementation for all staff from di
rectors and managers to dispatched workers and temporary employees in fiscal year 2012 we particularly
strengthened education for those working within processes in plants and introduced a program for them to
reacknowledge the importance of the standards for employee behavior through elearning in fiscal year
2012 a total of about 2900 employees took ibiden   s levelspecific csr compliance training

                                                             corporate social responsibility report2013 ibiden co ltd 16

daytoday compliance training
 to help employees better understand the details of the standards for employee behavior we issued the
case bookin which enlightenment cases for the standards for employee behavior are compiled to make
 employees thoroughly aware of the need for compliance in addition we continually provide examples of
 compliance practices on our own csr portal site on the intranet of the company as another way to improve
 staff awareness such compliance practices are also checked according to the respective activities at meet
 ings including morning meetings every week from fiscal year 2012 we have been managing the status of
 activities by small group at each plant and confirming that activities are carried out by all small groups


compliance by directors
when establishing a compliance system it is crucial that all executives and managers be at the forefront of
the efforts as september is csr month executives and the management persons responsible for csr attend
workshops by external instructors to gain a clear understanding of their role as managers
    in fiscal year 2012 following international moves to eliminate illegality including recent enhancement of
laws and regulations in various countries we held compliance lectures given by outside corporate auditors as
part of our efforts to further strengthen director and managersunderstanding of fair business practices
    furthermore executives must conduct themselves in accordance with the standards for employee behav
ior in both their personal and professional lives as the standards include items relevant to individual executive
such as regulations regarding competition as well as conflict of interest


whistleblowing system
after learning of any suspected compliance violation in the group
employees are generally required to report it to consult and to
take action using the chain of command between the superior
and the subordinate we have however established a compli
ance consultation service for quickly solving any problem that
cannot be reported through the usual channels the service is             compliance consultation service card
available not only to employees of ibiden group companies but                  distributed to all employees
to all those working for the group
   the compliance consultation service is based on protecting the rights of whistleblowers in ways including
securing the anonymity and privacy of persons who seek consultation and guaranteeing to ban giving them
any disadvantageous treatment the service is available not only to employees of ibiden group companies
but also to all those working for the group we endeavor to make the service known to everyone by distrib
uting cards which describe how to use the service and putting up posters we provide three access channels
                                                                       s office and the other at an outside or
to facilitate consultation one inside the company another at a lawyer
ganization

in fiscal year 2012 we provided consultations in 50 cases 70 cases in the previous year for the entire group
in japan though none of them significantly affected our business activities 10 cases were issues that could
lead to issues related to potential harassment in the relationship between superiors and subordinates most
of the cases were attributable to lack of communication we strive to prevent recurrence by giving guidance
to managers in terms of properly communicating including helping them to understand their positions as ad
ministrators and ensuring they appropriately use words
    to discover and deal with problems as early as possible we will continue our educational activities to en
hance our reliability by offering a consultation service that can be safely used by those who seek consultation
in addition we have set up a consultation service for our supplier we create an environment where we not
only offer consultations internally but also gather valuable feedback on ibiden   s compliance from our regular
supplier




                                                             corporate social responsibility report2013 ibiden co ltd 17

selfcheck of activities and opinion poll
we conduct a selfcheck on the status of compliance with the standards for employee behavior and a survey
on compliance awareness every year covering all employees including those of domestic group companies
   in the selfcheck employees subject to the selfcheck including employees holding managerial posts diag
nose the state of compliance with items of the standards for employee behavior and compliancerelated
challenges at each group company or plant are clarified through summarizing the results of the diagnosis any
problem identified in this process will be addressed through remedial activities at group companies and
plants in the following fiscal year we link little understood topics with educational programs for instance
case studies illustrating compliancerelated issues that many testtakers failed to answer correctly are pub
lished to increase their understanding
   in the opinion poll the degree of satisfaction with the workplace andor superiors and risks of injustice at
the workplace are evaluated from various aspects and features by office organization and those by group
companyplant are analyzed we monitor changes in employee awareness and reflect the results in the com
pliance activities and educational programs of the following fiscal year as is the case with the selfcheck


records of compliance
with regard to laws and regulations that affect the company a list of relevant laws and regulations has been
made and the status of their revisions is monitored mainly by the legal division we periodically review the
state of compliance with laws and regulations that have a particularly significant influence on the company
ibiden has no record of legal violations such as corruption and information leakage which have a major im
pact on business activities in fiscal year 2012




                                                              corporate social responsibility report2013 ibiden co ltd 18

 csr management in the supply chain

to earn the trust of international community while operating business globally both the group and the entire
supply chain must responsibly take actions that respond to social demands we believe that a sustainable
growth of the entire supply chain as well as a higher corporate value will be realized through promotion of
csr activities based on the basic policy of the ibiden group


basic purchasing policy
1 we comply with laws regulations and societal norms and strive to build relationships of trust and mutual
   cooperation with suppliers
2 we provide suppliers opportunity at a fair deal
3 we continue to fulfill our social responsibilities including human rights and environmental protection
   through purchasing activities


ibiden group supplier csr guidelines
ibiden began disclosing requests to suppliers based on its basic purchasing policies
in fiscal year 2008 and held a briefing session for 100 suppliers in fiscal year 2009
confirming the status of their measures this enabled us to confirm the gap in mea
sures among the suppliers and recognize the necessity of management which has led
to more specific improvements in the supply chain
   in fiscal year 2011 ibiden published ibiden group supplier csr guidelines fol
lowing the changes in the ibiden group charter of behavior these guidelines
provide our suppliers with items desired for the entire supply chain by our customers
the industry and the international community as well as the group the items are di
vided into subcategories according to themes such as labor health and safety
environment protection ethics and fair business practices these guidelines also al
low us to thoroughly understand the risks from several viewpoints such as worksite safety respect for and
dignified treatment of employees and the consideration given to the environment which in turn allows us to
make improvements


communication and cooperation with supplier
                                    we also invited our major suppliers after the publication of the guidelines
                                    to our briefing session to share with them in addition to the group itself
                                    specific challenges ahead as they play an important supporting role in
                                    matters such as material supply subcontracting and procuring of tempo
                                    rary staff starting from fiscal year 2011 we began activities to verify and
                                    or remedy challenges concerning activities at suppliers by ensuring in
                                    house resources including fostering of auditors and conducting
                                    investigations into suppliers as well as making site visits and audits
                                       in fiscal year 2012 we expanded the range of target suppliers and

ibiden supplierscompliance counter
the company promotes compliance rules and regulations ethical compliance by establishing the ibiden
group charter of behavior and the ibiden standards for employee behavior as part of our continued efforts
we also set up a compliance counter for our suppliers in fiscal year 2011 to which suppliers can report any
compliance problem while dealing with the company similar to the compliance counter for our internal em
ployees the information will be handled with the utmost care for privacy and the supplier will never suffer
prejudicial treatment for contacting the counter in fiscal year 2012 we continued to make known the compli
ance counter for our suppliers to all suppliers and some of them actually sought consultation


responding to the issue of conflict minerals
illegal mining of resources in conflict areas the democratic republic of the congo and its surrounding conflict
regions has become a major international issue as it abets human rights violations the ibiden group is very
much concerned about the issue of conflict minerals and is addressing the situation with a sense of social re
sponsibility toward the products it offers
   oursupplier csr guidelinesclearly state that the suppliers should refrain from illegal mining in conflict
areas as well as procuring resources that may support human rights violations the company tries its best to
avoid contributing to illegal operations and human rights violations by not utilizing minerals illegally mined in
conflict areas furthermore we will conduct reasonable investigations into the mineral supply routes and dis
close the findings in good faith
   since fiscal year 2011 we have been sharing with our suppliers the issues involving conflict minerals as
                   s approach during a briefing session we also conduct supplier surveys to verify their
well as the company
supply routes furthermore we conduct visits at some of our suppliersfacilities and other related refining
companies to explain the extent of the effort as well as verify the supply routes and their traceability history

update survey by december 2013 for fiscal year 2013 we will continue to periodically verify the status of use
of conflict minerals by our suppliers and see to it that we play no part in violation of human rights in the com

 labor and management cooperation to create a workerfriendly workplace

through a relationship of mutual trust both the management and workers of ibiden work together to create
a workplace that is friendly for all employees
   in fiscal year 2012 negotiations were held between labor and management with a focus on concrete co
operationrelated themes such as reduction of overwork encouragement of acquisition of annual paid leave
promotion of the proactive actions of female employees increase of mental and physical health and support
for employees loaned to overseas locations we did this in the areas of workinghour management creation
of a workerfriendly workplace and improvement in personnel systems the central labor council the labor
and management gathering and the labor and management committee are held every month to review the
status of progress in discussion themes and deliberate on ways to improve the working environment so that
employees can safely work toward the goals of their workplace

working hour management
an increase in workload due to extremely long hours of working is one of the causes of workrelated health
hazards
   in an effort to raise employeesawareness of workinghour management we have them use the atten
dance system to check their data which is designed to ensure accurate working hours and promote the
reduction of overtime work our goal is to cut the amount of overtime work by boosting operational efficien
cy which can be achieved by making employees aware of the accurate working hours and through better
communication between superiors and subordinates allowing them to review and rethink the work process
and system
   the company focuses on efforts for workinghour management including initiatives for promoting the ac
quisition of annual paid leave and activities aimed at reducing overtime work this includes sending a warning
to workers who are found to possibly violate rules on overtime work by monitoring through the system or to
their managers furthermore as a theme for fiscal year 2012 we provided living support and implemented
workinghour management to employees loaned to overseas locations whose number had increased accom
panying our expansion into overseas areas in fiscal year 2013 we will build a more accurate management
system so that the working hours of employees who are active on the global stage can be managed in real
time

creating a workerfriendly workplace
as a part of our 100th anniversary project we are planning specifically to improve our physical work environ
ment to promote female employee advancement the company worked on institutional improvement and
awareness reform through enhancing various support systems establishing consultation interviews to those
who are returning to work after a parental leave and implementing managerial posts training for employees
who could be promoted to managerial posts posts to promote mental and physical heath we had occupa
tional health physicians evaluate and analyze the results of mental health diagnosis and make proposals we
also prepared an example booklet and offered study meetings to enable employees to deepen their under
standing of the causes of mental health trouble using the booklet

communication between labor and management
in the company management policies items related to production plans and items concerning hiring policies
are explained to labor unions and items that seriously affect employees are deliberated through the central
labor council mentioned above in addition the company provides opportunities for dialogue at various lev
els between the management and workers including the labor and management committee which is held at
each plant with a view to facilitating a good labormanagement relationship and corporate business activities

quickly took corrective actions we had no record of legal violations related to labor laws such as those per

risksandstable supply of electricitysteamcold waterthe pillars of our activities making companywide
efforts toward environmental protection as the ibiden group in fiscal year 2013 we will continue to implement
the same pillars of the activities as follows
1we will reduce environmental loss through environmentrelated organization activities such as an ecoloss
    training camp to improve energy and resource loss reduction
2we will reduce energy loss through energy management in conjunction with load curtailment
3we will check for environmental loss at the time of improvement change to enhance the effectiveness of
    improvement
4we will enhance guidelines for earthquake disaster secondary prevention and achieve zero risk in terms of
    emergency environmental pollution
5we will build a global management system in compliance with chemical substancerelated laws and regu
    lations to achieve zero violations
6we will secure a stable supply of electricitysteamcold water through risk management

aiming to thoroughly eliminate the loss of resources and energy in business we place emphasis on energy
loss as one of the themes for companywide loss reduction efforts we extract analyze and classify energy
loss caused by demand sides and supply sides sharing information and confirming progress in thetraining
campaddressing the topic of ecological losses



 coping with climate change issues
through private power generation activities to supply clean energy as well as energy conservation efforts in
manufacturing activities we are working to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions to upgrade our private
power generation systems we are boosting our hydroelectric power generation capacity improving thermal
power generation efficiency and promoting fuel conversion with regard to energy conservation efforts in
manufacturing activities we are accelerating the improvement of energy conservation practices throughout
the company by strengthening companywide co2 reduction activities while all manufacturing divisions man
age the basic unit of energy consumption and set specific targets for each division

measures to supply clean energy
the ibiden group can trace its history back to a scheme aimed at building a hydroelectric power plant up
stream on the ibigawa river to supply power and attract industry and thereby help revitalize the nearby city
of ogaki the group was established under the name ibigawa electric company in 1912 but over time began
to utilize electricity to evolve into an electrochemical company we have continued to expand our business
since then including areas such as carbides carbon building materials ceramic products and electronic prod
ucts as we have grown and developed hand in hand with local communities
   ibiden owns three hydroelectric power plants in the upstream section of ibigawa river in gifu prefecture
hydraulic power generation uses the potential energy of water to create clean energy without greenhouse
gas emissions

    in our energy conservation activity we convert energy consumption to co2 emission and evaluate energy
consumption as well as co2 emission as our result
    we conducted our activities up until fiscal year 2012 with a target of improving our figures globally by 3
 per year using the co2 emission unit load rate in fiscal year 2008 as the benchmark fiscal year 2012 how
 ever saw a rise in total co2 emissions as the number of production bases increased the co2 emission unit
load rate is influenced by factors such as an expansion in fixed energy consumption and emission factors in
purchased electricity this meant that we saw a rise compared to the previous year and our target was not
met the figure however was still a reduction of 8 compared to fiscal year 2008 please refer to the graph
co2 emission and co2 emission unit load rate
    from fiscal year 2013 onward we will seek to improve energy conservation by 2 annually based on the
 co2 emission unit load per production volume for fiscal year 2012 as a mediumterm goal

 we have established energy conservation management standards that are applicable to utility facilities oper
 ated and managed by ibiden in energy control based on cost improvement through optimum management
 the standards aim todevelop a foundation for energy control andincrease the energy control level
 through the implementation of actions related to energy usage streamlining in fiscal year 2012 we aimed at
 building a system to prevent energy conservation efforts from regressing by increasing the rate of conformity
 to energy conservation standards and implementing energy conservation patrolaudits

improved the sortability of packaging materials and reviewed our subcontractors as a result we were able to
turn 20t per month of what would have been waste into valuable resources this activity will continue as a
mediumterm target beyond fiscal year 2013 we will aim to reduce the waste unit load rate per production
volume by 2 per year compared to fiscal year 2012

cycled water over 95 within the industrial park at the beijing plant where the use of water resources was
limited the water withdrawal per production volume for fiscal year 2012 achieved a 26 decrease compared
to fiscal year 2008 we will continue our commitment to reducing the water withdrawal unit load rate at all
plants by means of water conservation and recycling activities

 environmental contribution through products
product life cycle assessment
ibiden is promoting a design that takes into consideration safetyenvironmental rules and regulations energy
conservation and resource conservation from the initial stage of product development in design reviews to
examine product developmentdesign we have added product and process safety environmental regula
tionssafety of materials used and energy conservation consciousness reflected in the production process as
examination items currently we are building a system to confirm whether products developed and produced
by ibiden are environmentally friendly we plan to issue guidelines for environmentconscious designing and
start using them from fiscal year 2013


diesel particulate filter dpf
as environmental regulations are tightened the market for automotive exhaust system components is likely to
expand in the future ibiden is working to reduce the environmental burden by launching nextgeneration
highperformance products such as diesel particulate filters dpfs installed into fuelefficient clean diesel ve
hicles




                                               sicdpfdiesel particulate filter



in 2000 ibiden succeeded in achieving the practical application of dpfs made of silicon carbide sic which
boasts high thermal conductivity high heat resistance thermal shock resistance and high mechanical strength
as its baseline performance following that with a view to further reducing the environmental burden we de
veloped new technology such as the octsquare which helped achieve long life and the downsizing of the filters

            the inlet cell of the dpf is expanded in an octagonal form to increase the ash reten
            tion capacity this technology downsizes           the dpf volume to reduce material and en
            ergy consumption

3main environmental protection costs
in fiscal year 2012 investment increased 26 billion up 168 compared to fiscal year 2011 this was pri
marily because 2 global environmental protection costs increased due to maintenance work on water sup
ply tunnel associated with repair work for the hirose power plant facilities electricity supply for which began
in 1925 to improve performance and repair deterioration
    in fiscal year 2012 costs decreased 15 billion a decline of 15 compared to fiscal year 2011 this was
mainly because 1 pollution prevention costs and 3 resource circulation costs declined due to a de
crease in production volume and improvement activities including efficient operation of the liquid waste treat
ment facility
