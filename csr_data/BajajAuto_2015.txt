    parts directly to sub assembly vendors on behalf of bal

    this has led to the following benefits

                                                                          all clusters

    bal encourages local procurement of goods for its manufacturing operations as of this year
    over 70 of the procurement is carried out locally this has a dual benefit as it creates a significant
    positive impact on the local economy as well as reduces the companys carbon footprint

    the purchase department has adopted an inputprocessoutput ipo methodology to ensure zero
    rejection at bal and vendor end this results in the reduction of scrap generation across the supply
    chain for effective implementation of ipo training is being provided to vendor ceos plant heads and
    staff ipo is currently being undertaken by a majority of bals critical vendors


    waste reduction
    all four plants are working towards reducing the waste generated in their operations through a
    variety of innovative solutions at the pantnagar plant during the pretreatment line the
    phosphating process was replaced by the tectalis process which enabled zero hazardous waste
    generation further the paint shop effluents were 100 treated and used for gardening at the
    chakan plant waste paint was being sent to mepl ranjangaon a hazardous waste disposal site
    however through an initiative launched at the chakan plant the waste paint is now incinerated in the
    premise the heat recovered from this is utilised for paint shop chemical heating this has resulted in
    fuel savings of up to 40 additionally ro treated industrial effluent upto 40 kilo litres per day
