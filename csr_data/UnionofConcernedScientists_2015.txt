                                  tenth year of measuring and reporting our carbon emissions a lot has changed from a sus
                                  tainability perspective over the past decade today as a result of regular meetings with our
                                  analytical staff and ongoing partnerships with peer organizations we have been able to not
                                  only finetune our reporting methodology for more accurate data analysis but also explore
                                  new initiatives to further reduce our environmental impact our efforts are detailed in

                                  our internal sustainability work is a natural extension of the work we do to promote change at
                                  the regional national and international levels during this reporting period we launched our
                                  center for science and democracy with a lewis m branscomb forum dedicated to improving
                                  citizen access to governmental scientific information visit wwwucsusaorgscienceanddemocracy
                                  to learn more we also launched our half the oil campaign wwwucsusaorghalftheoil
                                  designed to cut projected us oil use by 50 percent by 2035 we witnessed the closure of
                                  chicagos two coalburning power plants on the heels of our ripe for retirement report and
                                  the strengthening of california policies that promote the development of zeroemissions
                                  vehicles and clean electricity resources additionally our nuclear experts met with the nuclear
                                  regulatory commission to present lessons learned from the fukushima daiichi nuclear
                                  disaster in march 2011 which can be applied here at home to make us nuclear power
                                  plants safer and more secure

                                  many of our external successes also affect our office environment and that of offices every
                                  where such as our efforts to clean the electricity grid and improve fuel efficiency we look

    in addition to providing data we can use for calculating travel
    related emissions concur allows staff to quantify and com

    concur does not track amtrak bus taxi or subway travel

    these sources was negligible in previous years accounting         utilizing video conference services allows ucs staff to participate collaboratively
