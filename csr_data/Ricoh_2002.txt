the ricoh groups vision




           as a global citizen the ricoh group
           aims at pursuing sustainable
           management and continues its
           environmental conservation practices

           the rich resources of our planet earth have given birth to many forms of life and have sup
           ported the wideranging and ambitious activities of mankind nevertheless recent activities
           have exceeded this lifesustaining ability of the earth this poses a threat not only to our
           coexistence with other forms of life on this planet but also to the future of the human race
           itself the environment is the most crucial issue that the whole mankind must tackle in
           order to bequeath a rich fertile earth to future generations each of us must reduce the
           environmental impact caused by our activities for that to happen globally governments
           companies citizen groups and even individuals in all countries and regions must be aware
           of the environmental impact that is affecting the entire planet and actively seek to reduce it

    kiyoshi ichimura ricohs founder explained the
    companys corporate philosophy as follows                    to be a good global corporate citizen with
       my motto in life is love your neighbor love your                   reliability and appeal
       country and love your work i believe that a
       persons worth depends on the depth and breadth
       of the love that heshe feels we have an innate
       love of ourselves as all animals do in the name of
                                                                                   our principles
       selfpreservation everyone at least loves
       himselfherself as time passes however this                      to think as an entrepreneur
       feeling of love grows and expands to include              to put ourselves in the other persons place
       parents siblings spouses and children and later
       goes on to encompass neighbors ones country                   to ﬁnd personal value in our work
       and ethnic group and ﬁnally all the people of the
       world at this point such people return the same
       amount of love or more to all people plants and
       animals therefore i am convinced that our true
       worth depends on how much love we give and how
       far that love extends
       the spirit of three loves is the foundation of
    ricohs approach to environmental conservation all
    global citizens should carry out their mission and         l management philosophy
    responsibilities by dealing with environmental             ricohs management philosophy was formally introduced

vision and strategy the comet circle




       using the comet circle concept to
       help the ricoh group build a society
       that recirculates resources


       the sustainable society of the future needs to produce      will be recycled after they are collected as trash we
       maximum output with minimum resources and energy           recommend applying any situation to the comet circle
       it needs to restrict the environmental impact of all           our mother earth is the most important and irre
       economic and social activities so that the natural envi    placeable component of the comet circle we within

       resents a resourcerecirculating society and points out     tinuous damage to the earth
       activities and partnerships that the ricoh group must
       deal with
           the ricoh group not only promotes its sustainable
       management but also enthusiastically encourages sup
       pliers customers and recycling companies to set up
       their own sustainable management moreover the
       group strives to make the resource recirculation of the
       comet circle smaller at all stages entities represented
       by spheres by improving economic efficiency and
       reducing environmental impact this would reduce the
       total amount of environmental impact produced by eco
       nomic and social activities
           the comet circle is a graphic representation of
       environmental conservation in todays world both the
       product and the manufacturing process of that product
       determine corporate value and what people purchase
       our philosophy goes beyond environmental conserva
       tion concepts and ensures the credibility of our prod
       ucts none of which are produced under poor conditions
       or with child labor or by any other reprehensible means
       such profiteering is both unfair and incompatible with
       the philosophy of ricoh group
           there are comet circle members other than the
       ricoh group suppliers customers and recycling com
       panies when individuals who direct their efforts toward
       building a society that recirculates resources more effi
       ciently shop for things that have less environmental
       impact separate their garbage for recycling or take
       environment conservation and social responsibilities
       into consideration when making investments they
       become a part of the comet circle too everybody
       should be aware of the resources that went into the
       clothes that they buy and how those things were deliv
       ered they should also think about how those clothes

       japan was 316





       for products marketed in fiscal 2001 the volume of lead polyvinyl chloride pvc and hexavalent chromium was reduced by 47 47 and 58 respectively
       the ricoh group continues its efforts in reduction and strives to completely eliminate specified chemical substances for products to be marketed from fiscal 2004
       onward





       the level of noise emitted during operation and while on standby was reduced by 33 db and 27db respectively surpassing the goal for products marketed in
       fiscal 2001 also the goal of reducing ozone by 70 and dust by 29 respectively was surpassed
        calculations are based on the weighted number of copiers facsimiles and printers sold and use a copying productivity of 50 sheets per minute for all machines





       reduced the use of ricoh groups target substances for reduction 466 and emissions 582 surpassing the goal in fiscal 2001





       completely eliminated the use of trichloroethylene tetrachloroethylene and chloroform worldwide also completely eliminated the use of dichloromethane
       except in the manufacturing of existing photosensitive materials continuous efforts are made to completely eliminate the use of dichloromethane in the
       manufacturing of existing photosensitive materials by the end of fiscal 2004 which is earlier than the original deadline
