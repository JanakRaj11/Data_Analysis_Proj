assessing the cumulative impacts across the lifespan of our products
to better understand the collective impact of our products fmc is conducting life cycle assessments of its portfolio of
customer solutions by understanding the role of each individual step in the life cycle of each product from raw materials
to manufacture to use we are better able to address the primary components of the products overall impact such
assessments also provide opportunities to collaborate across the value chain we work with suppliers and customers to
understand environmental effects whether they involve energy efficiency at the manufacturing stage specific materials
used or other key drivers of impact

biologicals explained
what are biological products biologicals are materials derived from renewable plant or microbial sources

what makes microbes or bacteria an ecologically sound starting point for rd bacteria are incredibly
abundant in the ground there are up to 10000 bacterial species and over 100 million bacterial cells per gram of
soil in and around plant roots1 just like the microbes in our bodies microorganisms have similar beneficial roles
in plants microorganisms live in and on the plants on the roots and in the soil where they maintain a synergistic
relationship with their plant hosts these microbes impart benefits such as faster seed germination increased
root development and uptake of water and nutrients and increased plant vigor biomass production fruit growth
disease protection and resilience against conditions such as frost and drought

how does fmc find specific microbes of interest for crop protection at fmcs center of excellence for
agricultural biosolutions at research triangle park north carolina we have isolated over 2100 strains of bacteria
for study determining their potential beneficial performance through the centers advanced screening process
strains of interest progress into more extensive field screening before moving into largescale field trials

what are the advantages of using biologicals in agricultural chemical products biologicals improve soil health
foster seed germination increase growth of plants allow for better management of nutrients fight diseases and
insects and increase crops resistance under stressed environmental conditions when certain biological material
is combined with smaller doses of one or more chemicals they can offer multiple modes of action including the
natural ability to respond to specific threats when used as a part of integrated pest management biologicals can
help to decrease the risk of resistance against major chemical active ingredients

why is it necessary to use any crop protection chemicals when planting biological and syntheticbased chemicals
are highly effective in protecting crops from disease pests and weeds their use can also increase crop quality and
yield this is important because the worlds growing population is experiencing food shortages that will only increase
in severity as population grows according to the united nations world food program2 feeding a global population
that is projected to reach 9 billion by 2050 will require that agricultural yields increase by 70100 percent

what is the difference between biologicals and genetic modification in genetically modified crops the dna is
modified to introduce a new trait to the plant that does not occur naturally in the development of fmcs agricultural
biologicals there is no modification of the plants or the microbes genetic structure we are drawing upon natures
natural potential to create solutions to improve plant health and productivity

who stands to gain from the use of biologicals consumers will see safer more environmentally friendly options
growers will gain new modes of action little or no residues and better yields

what is the future of biologically derived active ingredients in agriculture growers of fruits vegetables and row
crops such as corn wheat soybeans cotton and rice are seeking more environmentally friendly chemical solutions
biologicals will also be increasingly used in private homes and gardens as well as professional applications
including golf courses and landscaping

selecting responsible suppliers

our supplier code of conduct requires adherence to
sound human rights labor environmental and anti
corruption standards having screened fmcs most
significant raw material suppliers for compliance
with the code in 2013 we expanded the process and
began requalifying our key raw material suppliers
and construction contractors in 2014

given the large number of suppliers to our company
we have enlisted the services of a thirdparty auditor
to help us with the requalification process we
continue to evaluate and qualify all new suppliers

going forward we will leverage our management
                                                                                                   one of the goals of fmc agricultural solutions is to

supply risk and opportunities continue to work with                                               through a complex supply chain that starts with raw
our supply chain partners to integrate our processes                                               materials suppliers and ends with retailers who consult
into site policies and work closely with suppliers to                                             directly with local growers nothing is more important to
improve practices and drive innovation                                                            fmc than product stewardship safety and environmental

rockland and the community
celebrate
our fmc health and nutrition facility in rockland
maine officially converted from no 6 fuel oil to clean
burning natural gas the fmc team in rockland
celebrated the conversion with a clean energy and
safety celebration which included local government
dignitaries

converting to natural gas will help the facility significantly
lower emissions increase efficiency and obtain a
reliable and readily available energy source it is also
expected to create substantial savings compared to
using fuel oil

   we partnered with a small boat manufacturer                   opportunities
   to develop a vessel that could easily be moved
   by two people when loaded with seaweed
   previously farmers carried seaweed on their
   heads or in boats made from rare tropical
   hardwoods those boats were expensive heavy
   and lacked durability

   the recent product of this partnership is newly
   designed barges that allow farmers to pull
   large loads over reef flats they enable the
   safe hauling of 10 times more seaweed back
   to shore a substantial benefit in producing a
   reliable steady income for farmers

   fmcs local seaweed suppliers have
   subsequently purchased hundreds of
   seaweed barges for use by farmers in 2014

fmc employees address climate change in indonesia
our employees in ungaran indonesia decided to
use the 1500 they were awarded for winning the
december 2013 fmc fnish strong safety campaign
to extend a forest conservation program the effort
had been underway for over two years in semarang
an area on the coast approximately 20 kilometers
north of ungaran it is an area of indonesia that the
world wildlife fund considers an asian pioneer in
climate change adaptation and resilience

fmc collaborated with the bintari foundation the
indonesian association for sustainable development
along with dipone goro university semarang
state university and the semarang municipality on the project the goal was to expand an environmental
sustainability project to address the significant loss of mangrove trees resulting from the severe storms
and rising sea levels that have occurred due to climate change

with fewer mangrove trees to protect the region the sensitive semarang coast suffered serious erosion
weakened waste and drainage systems damaged transportation and housing infrastructure and reduced
access to clean water residents lost arable land and fishing ponds that became contaminated by seawater

to reverse the regions land deterioration and rehabilitate the local ecology the ungaran fmc facility purchased
and helped plant 10000 mangrove seedlings throughout the course of the project the mangroves will protect
the shoreline and in turn contribute to community revitalization
