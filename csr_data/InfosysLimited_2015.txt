promoting responsible supply chain  vendors and partners
being an information technology it and consulting company our solutions and
services rely more on intellectual assets than on physical assets our supply chain
implications are primarily related to our large supplier base for the procurement of
goods and services to support our operations this has encouraged us to strengthen
our responsible supply chain practices progressively every year we have a welldefined
mechanism to receive and address social and environmental grievances from all our
stakeholders in order to strengthen responsible business practices in our supply chain
a fourstage integrated framework called viva was implemented in fiscal year 2013
the viva framework includes 
 visioning  drafting policies and guidelines and operating code for the supply chain
 inculcating  focusing on process improvements
 valuing  creating awareness and providing training and competency building
 assessing  assessing supplier performance along environmental social and
   governance parameters

as a best practice we have formulated the following policies and guidelines for

 a responsible supply chain policy that categorizes our suppliers into three broad
  categories  people services and products  was launched in 2013                             to facilitate better risk assessment we have further classified the suppliers under 14

we also expect our suppliers to support and respect the protection of internationally
proclaimed human rights and to ensure that they are not complicit in human rights
abuses our contracts have appropriate clauses and checks to prevent the employment
of child labor or forced labor in any form we also provide forums such as sambandh

light fixtures with occupancy sensors
we have replaced t5 lamps with led fixtures having inbuilt occupancy sensors at our
bengaluru and thiruvananthapuram campuses the sensors work on the passive infrared
pir technology and detect movements within the coverage area and accordingly alter
the lighting levels and switch off the lights when there are no occupants in the room
the highest impact is observed during afteroffice hours when the building occupancy
is low these light fixtures have reduced our energy consumption by about 40 as
compared to what we were able to achieve using conventional t5 lamps

façade retrofits
air conditioning is the biggest energy consumer in buildings building envelope has a
big impact on occupant comfort as well as air conditioning requirement as it shields
the interior of the building from high and low ambient temperatures some of the
buildings in our campuses initially designed as glass buildings were uncomfortable
for people to work and resulted in high energy consumption we retrofitted the
façade of these buildings by reducing the amount of glass replacing single glass with
                                                                                                     the façade lighting at night at our mangaluru campus
double glazing and adding insulation to the walls this retrofit reduced the amount
of heat entering the building and thus resulted in reduced air conditioning energy
consumption and increased comfort for the occupants we plan to implement façade

we have designed and implemented an innovative façade lighting system at one of                      we have also replaced the conventional cfl and metal halide light fixtures with
our buildings at our mangaluru campus that has a builtup area of 100000 sq ft we                 efficient led lights this has resulted in a reduction in the lighting load by about 37
have installed led light fixtures to highlight specific elements of the building façade             as compared to that achieved by the use of conventional light fixtures
making it aesthetically appealing and enhancing viewers experience at night with
the use of efficient light fixtures the lighting load for the entire façade of the building
is a mere 246 watts

green technology innovations
we have pioneered the use of radiant cooling technology in india through the
deployment of radiant slab and radiant panelbased cooling systems we realized
that the available radiant panelbased cooling solutions in the market today may not
be costeffective in india hence through highquality engineering we developed
radiflux panels inhouse which use chilled water for cooling these panels are two
times more efficient than other products available in the market less than half the
cost and take 50 less time for installation they are also much more efficient flexible
and easily replicable this technology can be deployed on a large scale and has the
potential to transform the way cooling is done in india we have applied for india us
and european patents for this product

beema bamboo
we have planted beema bamboo to maximize carbon sequestration about 30000
beema bamboo plants have been planted in our sarjapur campus in bengaluru beema
bamboo has the capability to grow one foot per day at its peak creating a natural
canopy and cooling the surrounding area we are expecting production of 750 tons
of biomass from 30 acres in the first harvest 1000 tons in the 2nd harvest and 1200
tons from the 3rd harvest onwards in addition to reducing carbon footprint beema
bamboo can be used as an energy crop for generating oil charcoal ethanol and power
through gasification

carbon neutrality
infosys has committed to become carbon neutral across all emissions by 2018 scope 1
and 2 emissions are being addressed through energy efficiency initiatives and through
solar power plant installations and purchase of green power scope 3 emissions related
to employee commute and business travel which comprise over 50 of the total
emissions require carbon offset projects to be implemented infosys is now looking
at implementing different projects that offset carbon emissions as well as have strong
benefits for society potential projects being evaluated include rural electrification rural
biogas projects biomass projects afforestation efficient cookstoves etc                          radiflux panels developed by infosys

 direct ghg emissions are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by

 indirect ghg emissions are emissions that are a consequence of the activities of
