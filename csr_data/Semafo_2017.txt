strengthening our communities
the partnership approach adopted by semafo with its stakeholders enables the communities surrounding the mana mine
and our natougou project which is presently in construction to derive optimum benefit from our activities semafo
rigorously manages its community relationships to foster the social acceptability of its projects and conducts itself with the
utmost respect for human rights we pursue our humanitarian mission as a catalyst for sustainable community development

open relationships with communities  csr
open relationships with community representatives enable us to strengthen our partnerships a number of relationship
mechanisms are in place to ensure we stay attuned to community expectations combined these relationships foster the
social acceptability of our projects at the mana mine and at our natougou project members of the community relations
teams hold regular meetings with the population this proactive approach is highly effective as it allows us to maintain a
continuous dialogue with the population surrounding our mines and hence to take immediate measures if needed

in november 2016 the cclm local consultation committee at mana held a halfday meeting with communities that
attracted some 200 representatives from local communes and was presided by the high commissioner of the balé province
the cclm was established in 2009 with the aim of providing a forum for dialogue in which communities are apprised of
developments at mana mine learn about semafo foundation activities and can bring up concerns the meeting which
was carried out in an atmosphere of mutual respect concluded with a series of recommendations for both parties the
committees recommendations for the population highlighted the need for better organization and buyin of projects on their
part in addition to the need to obtain the states authorization before building largescale projects on the semafo side
the recommendations focused on communication the need to make community achievements more visible and to address
concerns about dust

relocation of communities
some mining projects such as our natougou project require local communities to be relocated a carefully crafted approach
to relocation operations is essential to minimize negative social and economic impacts under the resettlement action plan
rap for the natougou project filed with the government of burkina faso in the second quarter of 2016 165 concessions
involving 900 inhabitants are to be relocated and compensation to be paid for 813 hectares of farmland at total cost of
8 million to empower affected communities to make informed decisions with regard to the rap semafo bussed 34
residents from villages surrounding the natougou project 640 kilometers west to its mana mine during their factfinding
mission delegates visited a mine for the first time discussed living conditions and compensation with residents of the
resettled village of dangouna and witnessed firsthand semafo foundations livelihood projects

we also ensure that relocation activities are accompanied by appropriate communication and consultation with the people
affected with the continuous objective to improve the livelihood of the communities in addition to paying fair monetary
compensation for farmland at the natougou project semafo was approached by some residents interested in obtaining
full or partial compensation for their relocation in the form of food rather than money over a period of five years to
accommodate the request semafo foundation built two 40tonne grain banks thus ensuring the food security of the
communities in the boungou and natougou areas during lean periods at the end of 2016 following receipt of the mining
permit for natougou from the government of burkina faso we commenced civil infrastructure work and the project is moving
smoothly ahead thanks to our continuous liaison with the local communities

promote a culture of health and safety
we have enhanced our prevention program putting in place structures and activities to control and eliminate the sources of
hazard to health safety and the physical integrity of our workers we strongly believe that employee involvement in these
structured prevention activities ensures that risks and hazards are assessed identified and controlled and that injuries
illness and material losses are reduced

to curb the problem of malaria we maintained training and educational programs for employees and our communities in
2016 to date the measures established by the corporation at the mana mine have proved effective as evidenced by the
20 decrease in malaria in national employees over a twoyear period in fact national employees only contract malaria
when they return to their home villages and fail to follow through with preventive measures taught at the mine

at the natougou project we have set up a health facility by hiring a doctor and a nurse and will continue implementing our
best practices in this regard

joint inspection an excellent prevention activity
developed in 2012 the joint workplace inspection program continues to be a strong component of our preventive
measures inspections focus on worksite elements that can affect employee health and safety and are performed by one
supervisor and one employee both of whom have successfully completed training this systematic approach allows detailed
inspections of all company locations to be carried out on a regular basis taking into account the dynamics of an ever
changing environment inspections help detect irregularities related to the physical appearance of the site work
environment methods equipment and work organization afterward the corrective and preventive actions are written up in
a report and a followup plan to measure the new actions is quickly organized

in 2015 in spite of a lower number of accidents with lost time the number of lost work days increased from 20 to 35 relative

the environment an integral part of our management process
compliance
the effectiveness and compliance of our environmental management system are regularly audited by a third party these
external audits cover all elements likely to have an impact on the physical biological and human environments their
recommendations feed our companys continual improvement process in this way we enrich our knowledge and
understanding of the stakes and we honour our commitment to promote respect of the environment

the mana mine was subject to four environmental inspections from different levels of government in 2016 all of which
commended the efforts made to protect the environment the ensuing recommendations have been implemented on both
a shortterm and mediumterm basis

in the fourth quarter of 2016 members of the environmental health  safety and sustainable development committee
paid their annual visit to the mana mine in order to monitor the different components of their mandate during their time at
mana members noted an impressive increase in safety and environment increased employee involvement in their
departments success and the health and safety departments strong focus on the shop floor

site rehabilitation
each year financial resources are allocated for implementation of our progressive rehabilitation program through this
program we work proactively to minimize our impact when our mines are closed and we consolidate our protection and
compensation measures the latter activities are adapted to our rehabilitation plan for the mana mine the cost for which is
estimated at 147 million

climate change
for an eighth consecutive year in 2016 we contributed
to the fight against climate change by supporting
reforestation in burkina faso we took concrete action
to honour this commitment procuring 61100 trees and
shrubs that were planted in 15 villages surrounding our
three deposits through mobilisation of 265 village
residents and regional state services in this project our
environment department collaborates closely with
regional environmental players who propose species
suited to the climatic conditions of burkina faso

following an increase in ore processed in 2016
28 million tonnes compared to 24 million tonnes in
2015 and a harder ore processed we recorded a 16
yearoveryear increase in fuel consumption at the plant
for a total of 164 million liters in 2016 however at
0263 and 2263 respectively the number of liters per
kwh and kwh per tonne processed remained at similar
levels to those in 2015 manas energy plant consumed
62305 mw compared to 53057 mw in 2015 total
diesel required to run our mobile equipment and to
power the mana mine amounted to 396 million liters in                 reforestation program in surrounding villages of mana mine
2016 compared to 357 million liters in the year prior

air quality monitoring program
in 2015 we signed a threeyear collaboration agreement with an external specialist to provide the sampling analysis
equipment and certification of air quality and airborne emissions on the mana plant first samplings of gases ozone o3
sulfur dioxide so2 and nitrogen dioxide no2 in the ambient air were carried out on 10 different sites in communities
surrounding the mana mine results to date are well below both burkina faso and world health organisation who

in burkina faso
goods and services required for mining activities
generate significant direct and indirect economic
benefits that in turn are an engine of economic                                      procurement in 2016
growth for the economy of burkina faso we
create wellpaid jobs foster growth and provide
government with needed revenue through job
creation royalties and taxes we contribute to
government revenues and gdp and thus to the
prosperity of this country

besides employing mainly nationals we create                                      45
jobs indirectly by supporting the development of
domestic entrepreneurs wherever possible we                                                                    55
advocate purchasing from local and regional
suppliers in burkina faso approximately 55
101 million of our total purchases in 2016
183 million were made locally less than the
66 of local purchasing recorded last year this
year the local procurement percentage was
negatively impacted by deposits made for
equipment and infrastructure required for                                 burkinabè suppliers            international suppliers
