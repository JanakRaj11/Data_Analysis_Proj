2   lundin petroleum sustainability report 2015

i would like to conclude by saying that our vision back in
2001 was to make a positive contribution to society we feel
we are doing so not only by providing a source of energy
in an efﬁcient and responsible way  protecting people
and the environment  but also by providing employment
and tax revenues in the countries where we work and by
supporting good causes through our partnership with the
lundin foundation but as i always say there is always room
for improvement so together with my colleagues we will
continue to strive for excellence

yours sincerely

the scope of reporting was determined by setting the
boundaries and selecting indicators for the material issues
boundaries are set in relation to the impact of material issues
and where these impacts occur as they may vary from one
operational environment to another offshore activities
with no immediate surrounding communities such as our
operations in malaysia and norway differ from our onshore
operations in france likewise there is a distinction between
operated assets where the company has operational control
and nonoperated assets where the company has oversight but
no direct management control

i was impressed by the elearning course it was an excellent

contractor management
safety is everyones responsibility and lundin petroleum
expects the same high level of commitment from its
contractors suppliers and partners

responsible contractor management starts with a due diligence
process at prequaliﬁcation stage during which contractors are
screened using hse criteria our agreements with contractors
contain clauses on their obligation to abide by the principles
of lundin petroleums code of conduct hse management
system as well as internationally recognised rules and
standards on corruption labour standards and human rights

in 2015 lundin petroleum developed a formal contractor
declaration which was issued in its countries of operations
the declaration sets out our expectations in relation to the
way contractors carry out their activities and by including
the declaration in all new awarded contracts it ensures
that contractors are aware of our corporate responsibility
requirements and their obligations


wherever we operate we
engage with our contractors on
safety management
                                                                     drilling operations in paris basin france
safety forum in france
lundin petroleums expectations of contractors also extend to
holding dedicated meetings to highlight the importance of hse
performance

in france lundin petroleums hse team organises every year a
safety forum for its contractors in 2015 more than 100 people
representing 90 contractors attended the meeting including
ceos general managers hse managers and members of health                   france
and safety committees

after a site visit to the vertlagravelle new production
facilities the forum started with presentations on general                                    paris basin
safety instructions experiences and lessons learned from the
past year as well as changes in safety and environmental
requirements the forum offers a unique opportunity to share
information on developments in the company annual safety
statistics and to emphasise lundin petroleums expectations              aquitaine basin
towards contractors in terms of responsible business practices
as laid out in lundin petroleums code of conduct and
contractor declaration

at this safety forum onetoone sessions are organised with
each contractor to perform risk analyses of their activities this
is an effective way to establish individual prevention plans and
ensures regulatory obligations are met

     and emergency preparedness analyses

     the emergency preparedness is tested on an ongoing basis
     together with contractors this is done through regular
     emergency response drills conducted at field and country level
     in addition there is at least one drill per operation and per
     year conducted with the corporate crisis management team

     throughout the year internal and third party hse audits

      oil spill detection
      our edvard grieg platform in norway is the ﬁrst to have
      installed for a fullscale trial a newlydeveloped radar designed
      to detect oil on the sea surface this new radar has a remote
      sensing system for detection and mapping of potential
      pollution

      compared to conventional oil spill detection systems the new
      radar utilises an enhanced sensing method which allows it to
      detect oil with far better precision and range it can potentially
      measure the thickness of an oil spill and thus estimate the
      volume of oil in the spill

      the development and qualiﬁcation of this new oil spill
      detection radar is the result of the collaboration bewteen
      lundin norway statoil and ispas and has received funding
      from the research council of norway

     climate change
     climate change represents
     a global challenge that has an
     effect on the way we do
     business

     lundin petroleums ambition is to continue to expand its
     existing asset base and to explore develop and produce oil
     and gas resources in the most efﬁcient way from emissions
     perspective to meet this objective we have developed over
     the years systems and processes that increase energy efﬁciency
     and reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout our global
     operations

     the majority of lundin petroleums activities are located in
     norway the area in the world which over the past ten years
     has had the lowest carbon intensity levels in the industry
     it also represents an area with high standards and costs for
     emissions by including climate change considerations in
     operational activities and in the selection of installation
     designs products and equipment we have minimised both our
     carbon footprint and our operational costs

     greenhouse gas emissions
     lundin petroleum manages greenhouse gas ghg emissions
     through operational energy efﬁciency by reducing ﬂaring
     or venting and by factoring a carbon cost into the economic
     planning and engineering design of new projects we also
     apply the latest available technique principle bat for new
     activities in order to beneﬁt from ever increasing energy
     efﬁcient equipment or processes

     lundin petroleums direct ghg emissions were 109 million
     tonnes in 2015 the companys ghg emission levels are
     inﬂuenced by shifts in business activity with the startup of
     two operated production sites we have signiﬁcantly increased
     our production 2015 emissions are therefore not comparable
     with those of previous years

     meeting the energy needs of the future
     oil and gas provide nearly 60 percent of the worlds energy
     and will continue to make up a large part of the demand
     for decades to come the challenge that lies ahead will be
     to develop and produce these resources in the most energy
     efﬁcient and environmentally responsible way

     in addition to operational measures lundin petroleum
     monitors and actively participates in the debate on climate
     change and through engagement with environmental
     organisations and other stakeholders we stay informed of
     the latest developments on international climate policy as
     part of our risk and environmental management we analyse
     upcoming climate policy measures and how they will affect
     the energy market and take this into account in our strategic
     planning to make sure that our asset base is robust and
     sustainable now and in the future

     through the lundin foundations projects on renewable
     energy and forest conservation we contribute to climate
     change resilience see pages 3536
