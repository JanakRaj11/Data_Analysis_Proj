     management anticipates that all of the above standards and interpretations will be adopted in the groups
     financial statements in the effective period and that the adoption of these standards and interpretations
     will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group in the period of initial application
 12 changes in accounting policies
     a number of new and revised standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january
     2013 information on these new standards is presented below
     ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements ifrs 10
     ifrs 10 supersedes ias 27 consolidated and separate financial statements ias 27 and sic 12
     consolidation  special purpose entities ifrs 10 revises the definition of control and provides extensive
     new guidance on its application these new requirements have the potential to affect which of the
     groups investees are considered to be subsidiaries and therefore to change the scope of consolidation
     the requirements on consolidation procedures accounting for changes in noncontrolling interests and
     accounting for loss of control of a subsidiary are unchanged
     management has reviewed its control assessments in accordance with ifrs 10 and has concluded that

12   changes in accounting policies continued
      management has reviewed the impact of the following new and revised standards effective for annual
      periods beginning on or after 1 january 2013 and is of the view that the adoption of these standards and
      interpretations has no material impact on the financial statements of the group
       ifrs 11 joint arrangements ifrs 11
       ifrs 13 fair value measurement ifrs 13
       consequential amendments to ias 27 separate financial statements ias 27 and ias 28 investments
        in associates and joint ventures ias 28
       amendments to ias 19 employee benefits ias 19
13 significant judgements
    in the process of applying the groups accounting policies management has made the following
    judgements apart from those involving estimations which have the most significant effect on the amounts
    recognised in the financial statements
      impairment
      the recoverable amount of intangible assets that are not yet available for use is estimated annually the
      recoverable amount of an asset is calculated as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use
      in assessing the value in use the expected future cashflows from the asset are discounted to their present
      value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
      risks specific to the assets
      the discount rate applied is based on estimates and judgements made by management and is subject
      to change an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss whenever the carrying amount of the assets
      exceeds its recoverable amount
      residual value and useful life
      property plant and equipment and intangible assets are depreciated or amortised over their estimated
      useful lives taking into account residual values following the requirements of international accounting
      standards ias 16 property plant and equipment as well as ias 38 intangible assets estimated useful lives
      and the residual values are reassessed at each financial year end the actual lives and residual values of
      those assets can vary depending on a variety of factors
      technological innovation product life cycles and maintenance programmes all impact the useful lives and
      residual values of the assets residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions
      the remaining life of the asset and projected disposal values
      deferred tax assets
      the group recognises the net future tax benefit related to deferred income tax assets to the extent that it
      is probable that the deductible temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future
      assessing the recoverability of deferred tax requires the group to make significant estimates related to
      expectations of future taxable income
      recoverability of deferred tax assets requires estimates of future taxable income based on forecast cash
      flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction the extent that future
      cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates the ability of the group to realise the net
      deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could be impacted
      provisions
      provisions were raised and management determined an estimate based on the information available
      additional disclosure of these estimates of provisions is included in the provisions note
14 basis of consolidation
    the group financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and all of its subsidiaries as
    of 30 june 2014 the parent controls a subsidiary if it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from
    its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
    subsidiary all subsidiaries have a reporting date of 30 june




                                                                                                                         53

 group accounting policies

 14 basis of consolidation continued
      all transactions and balances between group companies are eliminated on consolidation including
      unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group companies where unrealised losses on intra
      group asset sales are reversed on consolidation the underlying asset is also tested for impairment from
      a group perspective amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted
      where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the group
      profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
      recognised from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as applicable
      noncontrolling interests presented as part of equity represent the portion of a subsidiarys profit or loss
      and net assets that is not held by the group the group attributes total comprehensive income or loss of
      subsidiaries between the owners of the parent and the noncontrolling interests based on their respective
      ownership interests
      business combinations
      the group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations the consideration
      transferred by the group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisitiondate fair
      values of assets transferred liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the group which includes
      the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement acquisition costs
      are expensed as incurred
      the group recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination
      regardless of whether they have been previously recognised in the acquirees financial statements prior
      to the acquisition assets acquired and liabilities assumed are generally measured at their acquisitiondate
      fair values
      goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets it is calculated as the excess
      of the sum of a fair value of consideration transferred b the recognised amount of any noncontrolling
      interest in the acquiree and c acquisitiondate fair value of any existing equity interest in the acquiree
      over the acquisitiondate fair values of identifiable net assets if the fair values of identifiable net assets
      exceed the sum calculated above the excess amount ie gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in
      profit or loss immediately
 15 property plant and equipment
     the cost of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised as an asset when
       it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and
       the cost of the item can be measured reliably
      property plant and equipment is initially measured at cost
      costs include costs incurred initially to acquire or construct an item of property plant and equipment and
      costs incurred subsequently to add to replace part of or service it if a replacement cost is recognised in
      the carrying amount of an item of property plant and equipment the carrying amount of the replaced
      part is derecognised
      the initial estimation of the cost of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is
      located is also included in the cost of property plant and equipment
      property plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
      losses
      depreciation is provided on all property plant and equipment other than freehold land to write down the
      cost less residual value on a straight line basis over their useful lives as follows
       item                                                                             average useful life
       buildings                                                                        20 years
       leasehold improvements                                                           5 years
       plant and machinery                                                              5 years
       furniture and fixtures                                                           6 years
       motor vehicles                                                                   5 years
       office equipment                                                                 5 years
       it equipment                                                                     3  4 years on average
       call centre equipment                                                            5 years


54         annual financial statements

15 property plant and equipment continued
    the residual value useful life and depreciation method of each asset are reviewed at the end of each
    financial year
     each part of an item of property plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total
     cost of the item shall be depreciated separately
     the depreciation charge for each period is recognised in profit or loss unless it is included in the carrying
     amount of another asset
     the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property plant and equipment is included in
     profit or loss when the item is derecognised the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of
     property plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds if any
     and the carrying amount of the item
16 intangible assets
    an intangible asset is recognised when
      it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to
       the entity and
      the cost of the asset can be measured reliably
     intangible assets are initially recognised at cost
     an intangible asset arising from development or from the development phase of an internal project is
     recognised when
      it is technically feasible to complete the asset so that it will be available for use or sale
      there is an intention to complete and use or sell it
      there is an ability to use or sell it
      it will generate probable future economic benefits
      there are available technical financial and other resources to complete the development and to use
       or sell the asset
      the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably
     all other expenditure that does not meet all of these requirements are expensed to profit or loss when
     incurred
     intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses
     an intangible asset is regarded as having an indefinite useful life when based on all relevant factors
     there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows
     amortisation is not provided for these intangible assets for all other intangible assets amortisation is
     provided on a straight line basis over their useful life
16 intangible assets continued
    the amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets are reviewed every yearend
    reassessing the useful life of an intangible asset with a definite useful life after it was classified as indefinite
    is an indication that the asset may be impaired
     as a result the asset is tested for impairment and the remaining carrying amount is amortised over its useful life
     intangible assets consist of the following
      computer software and
      internally developed assets
     amortisation is provided to write down the intangible assets on a straight line basis to their residual values
     as follows




                                                                                                                      55

 17 investments in subsidiaries
     company financial statements
     in the companys separate financial statements investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any
     accumulated impairment
       the cost of an investment in a subsidiary is the aggregate of
        the fair value at the date of exchange of assets given liabilities incurred or assumed and equity
         instruments issued by the company plus
        any costs directly attributable to the purchase of the subsidiary
       an adjustment to the cost of a business combination contingent on future events is included in the cost of
       the combination if the adjustment is probable and can be measured reliably
 18   investments in associates
       associates are those entities over which the group is able to exert significant influence but which are not
       subsidiaries
       investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method
       any goodwill or fair value adjustment attributable to the groups share in the associate is not recognised
       separately and is included in the amount recognised as investment
       the carrying amount of the investment in associates is increased or decreased to recognise the groups
       share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate adjusted where necessary to
       ensure consistency with the accounting policies of the group
       unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the group and its associates are eliminated to the
       extent of the groups interest in those entities where unrealised losses are eliminated the underlying asset
       is also tested for impairment
 19 financial instruments
     initial recognition and measurement
     the group classifies financial instruments or their component parts on initial recognition as a financial asset
     a financial liability or equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement
       financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the groups statement of financial position when
       the group becomes party to the contractual provision of the instrument
       financial assets and liabilities are offset and disclosed on a net basis in the consolidated statement of
       financial position when there is a legal right to set off and there is an intention either to settle on a net basis
       or to release the asset and settle the liability simultaneously
       loans to from group companies
       these instruments are initially measured at fair value including transaction costs
       subsequently these loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any
       impairment loss recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts
       on loans receivable an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that
       it is impaired the impairment is measured as the difference between the instruments carrying amount
       and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed
       at initial recognition
       impairment losses are reversed in subsequent periods when an increase in the instruments recoverable
       amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised subject
       to the restriction that the carrying amount of the instrument at the date of impairment is reversed shall not
       exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised




56          annual financial statements

19 financial instruments continued
    trade and other receivables
    trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value including transaction costs and are
    subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method appropriate allowances
    for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence
    that the asset is impaired the allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets
    carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest
    rate computed at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition
     trade and other receivables is presented net of the allowance account any movement in the allowance
     account is recognised in profit or loss uncollectable amounts are written off against the allowance
     account subsequent reversals of amounts previously written off are credited to profit or loss
     trade and other payables
     trade payables are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured
     at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method
     cash and cash equivalents
     cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other shortterm highly
     liquid investments arrangements entered into cash and cash equivalents are initially recognised at fair
     value including transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
     rate method
     equity instruments
     financial liabilities and equity
     financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the group are classified according to the substance of
     the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and equity instrument
     an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after
     deducting its liabilities
     derecognition of financial assets
     the group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cashflows from the assets
     expire or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset
     to another entity
     if the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues
     to control the transferred asset the group recognises its retained interest in the asset and the associated
     liability for amounts it may have to pay
     if the group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset the
     group continues to recognise the financial asst and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the
     proceeds received
     derecognition of financial liabilities
     the group derecognises financial liabilities when and only when the groups obligations are discharged
     cancelled or they expire
     other financial liabilities
     other financial liabilities including interest bearing borrowings that are reflected on the face of the
     statement of financial position are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs other financial
     liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method with interest
     expense recognised on an effective yield method
     when the effect of discounting is not considered to be material discounting is not applied as the nominal
     value approximates the amortised cost value
     liabilities payable within the next year are classified as current liabilities liabilities payable after one year
     are classified as noncurrent liabilities




                                                                                                                     57

     financial position when there is a legal right to set off and there is an intention either to settle on a net basis
     or to release the asset and settle the liability simultaneously
      financial instruments in general
      when the effect of discounting of financial instruments as a whole is not material discounting is not applied
      as the nominal values approximate the amortised cost value
      financial instruments as a whole that are receivable or payable within the next year are classified as
      current assets financial instruments as a whole that are receivable or payable after one year are classified
      as noncurrent assets
 110 tax
      current tax
      the tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year taxable profit differs from net profit as
      reported in the statement of comprehensive income where it includes items of income and expenses
      that are accounted for in other periods and it further excludes items that are not taxable or deductible
      the group liability for current tax is calculated using rates currently enacted and substantially enacted at
      financial year end
      where the estimated current tax payable exceeds the tax already paid the difference is recognised as a
      current liability however if the estimated current tax payable is less than the current tax already paid the
      difference is recognised as a current asset
      deferred tax
      deferred tax is recognised on difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
      financial statements and corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit or loss and
      are accounted for using the comprehensive liability method
      deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax
      assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable
      that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised
      such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from
      the initial recognition other than a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction
      that affects neither the taxable profit or loss nor the accounting profit or loss deferred tax liabilities are
      recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except where
      the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and its probable that the temporary
      difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future
      deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are
      only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to
      utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future
      the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent
      that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset
      to be recovered
      deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period
      in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates and tax laws that have been
      enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date the measurement of deferred tax liabilities and
      assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the group expects at
      reporting date to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities
      deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
      against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority
      and the group intends to settle its current assets and liabilities on a net basis




58         annual financial statements

110 tax continued
     current and deferred tax for the year
     current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss except when they relate
     to items credited or debited to profit or loss in which case the tax is also recognised directly in profit or loss
     or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination
     in the case of a business combination the effect is taken into account in calculating goodwill or in
     determining the gain or bargain purchase
111 leases
     a lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
     ownership to the lessee
     a lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards
     incidental to ownership
     operating leases  lessee
     operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term the
     difference between the amounts recognised as an expense and the contractual payments are recognised
     as an operating lease asset or liability this asset or liability is not discounted
     any contingent rents are expensed in the period they are incurred
112 inventories
     inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value on the firstinfirstout fifo basis
     net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs
     of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale
     the cost of inventories comprises of all costs of purchase costs of conversion and other costs incurred in
     bringing the inventories to their present location and condition
     when inventories are sold the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense in the
     period in which the related revenue is recognised
     the amount of any writedown of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventories are
     recognised as an expense in the period of the write off or when the loss occurs the amount of any reversal
     of any writedown of inventories arising from an increase in net realisable value are recognised as a
     reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs
     the reversal of a writedown or loss is limited to that initial writedown or loss
113 impairment of assets
     at each reporting date the group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to
     determine whether there is an indication that those assets may be impaired if any such indication exists
     the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if
     any where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount for an individual asset the recoverable
     amount is determined for the cashgenerating unit to which it belongs
     for the purposes of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the
     cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of
     the combination impairments to goodwill are never subsequently reversed
     recoverable amount is the higher of fair values less cost to sell and value in use in assessing value in
     use the estimated future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate
     that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or
     cashgenerating unit for which the estimates of future cashflows have not been adjusted
     if the recoverable amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying
     amount the carrying amount of the asset cashgenerating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount
     impairment losses are recognised as an expense immediately in profit or loss
     where an impairment loss subsequently reverses the carrying amount of the asset cashgenerating unit
     is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount but so that the increased carrying amount
     does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been
     recognised for the asset cashgenerating unit in prior years




                                                                                                                       59

 group accounting policies

 114 share capital and equity
      an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after
      deducting all of its liabilities
      if the group reacquires its own equity instruments those instruments are deducted from equity no gain
      or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase sale issue or cancellation of the groups own equity
      instruments consideration paid or received shall be recognised directly in equity
      transaction costs incurred on such transactions are netted off or deducted from equity
 115 employee benefits
      shortterm employee benefits
      the cost of shortterm employee benefits those payable within 12 months after the service is rendered
      such as paid vacation leave and sick leave bonuses and nonmonetary benefits such as medical care
      are recognised in the period in which the service is rendered and are not discounted
      the expected cost of compensated absences is recognised as an expense as the employees render
      services that increase their entitlement or in the case of nonaccumulating absences when the absence
      occurs
      the expected cost of profit sharing and bonus payments is recognised as an expense when there is a legal
      or constructive obligation to make such payments as a result of past performance
 116 provisions and contingencies
      provisions are recognised when
       the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event
       it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the
        obligation and
       a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation
      a provision is the present value of expenditure expected to be required to settle an obligation
      if the effect of the time value of money is not considered to be material the expenditure expected to be
      required to settle the obligation is not present valued as the carrying amount approximates the present
      valued amount
      the rate applied to present value the expenditure would be a market related pretax rate that incorporates
      the risk associated with the liability
      where some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed by another
      party the reimbursement shall be recognised when and only when it is virtually certain that reimbursement
      will be received if the entity settles the obligation
      the reimbursement shall be treated as a seperate asset the amount recognised for the reimbursement
      shall not exceed the amount nof the provision
      provisions are not recognised for future operating losses
      if an entity has a contract that is onerous the present obligation under the contract shall be recognised
      and measured as a provision
      contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised other than contingent liabilities assumed in
      a business combination which are recognised at acquisition date at fair value

117 borrowing costs
     borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of a qualifying asset are
     capitalised during the period of time that is necessary to complete and prepare the asset for its intended
     use or sale other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and reported in
     finance costs
118 cost of services
     the related cost of providing services recognised as revenue in the current period is included in cost of
     sales when incurred
119 translation of foreign currencies
     foreign currency transactions
     a foreign currency transaction is recorded on initial recognition in rands by applying to the foreign
     currency amount the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at
     the date of the transaction
     at each reporting date
      foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate
      nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated
       using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction
     exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates
     different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous
     financial statements are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise
     when a gain or loss on a nonmonetary item is recognised directly in equity any exchange component of
     that gain or loss is recognised directly in equity when a gain or loss on a nonmonetary item is recognised
     in profit or loss any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss
     cash flows arising from transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in rands by applying to the foreign
     currency amount the exchange rate between the rand and the foreign currency at the date of the cash
     flow

      value of the interest bearing liabilities approximates the carrying value the carrying value is calculated as
      the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a market related rate
      concentration of risk
      the groups financial instruments do not represent a concentration of credit risk because it deals with a
      variety of major banks and its debtors and loans are regularly monitored an adequate level of provision
      is maintained
      foreign currency risk
      in the past and in the normal course of business the group has entered into transactions denominated in
      foreign currencies the group currently does not hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates
      however all sales during the current year have been denominated in south african rands the foreign
      currency risk the group was exposed to at year end was not material and therefore no sensitivity analysis
      is performed

 notes to the financial statements

 30   risk management continued
       interest rate risk
       fluctuating interest rates impact on the value of shortterm cash investments and financing activities giving
       rise to interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business the group receives cash from its operations and
       is required to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements the cash is managed to ensure
       surplus funds are invested in a manner to achieve returns while minimising risks
       the groups exposure to interest rates on financial assets is r1191 million 2013 r1093 million and financial
       liabilities are r49 million 2013 r64 million
       interest rate sensitivity analysis
       the sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on exposure to interest rates at the reporting date
       if interest rates has been 100 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant the groups
       profit for the year under review would have increased by r913 458 2013 r835 547
       if interest rate had been 100 basis points lower and all other variables were held constant the groups
       profit for the year under review would have decreased by r913 458 2013 r835 547
       the groups sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period mainly due to the increase
       in cash and cash equivalents reserves
       credit risk
       credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial
       loss to the group the group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties
       more than 90 of the groups revenue is generated through transactions with the three local cellular
       phone service providers and one large fixed line local telecoms provider the directors believe that these
       companies are all able to finance their debt adequately
       the total loans to group companies amounts to r4 832 484 2013 r9 495 693 these amounts are
       intercompany and the directors believe these will be recoverable
       financial assets exposed to credit risk at year end were as follows

       liquidity risk
       the group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves banking facilities and reserve borrowing
       facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of
       financial assets and liabilities
       the table below analyses the groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the
       remaining period at the financial position date to the contractual maturity date the amounts disclosed in
       the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows balances due within 12 months equal their carrying
       balances as the impact of discounting is not significant

       reason for and effect of special resolution 1
       over the last 17 years the group provided services to thousands of clients and collected large amounts
       of data whilst the data existed there was very little around information or knowledge associated with the
       data the data was also collected in various forms of calls to action using mass media such as television
       radio and print in essence the data aged and was never leveraged to information and knowledge and
       thus became meaningless and never monetised the group identified this pattern as an opportunity to re
       visit data and knowledge management
       with mass marketing declining and onetoone marketing increasing there is an accelerated need to
       understand the customer better so as to communicate in a dialogue and not a monologue and to provide
       the customer with marketing material that is meaningful relevant and anticipated
       over the next few decades the intelligent use of data knowledge will become one of the biggest
       competitive advantages a company can have
       however collecting processing and using this data to communicate will come with a number of challenges
        consumers digital purchasing journeys are becoming more complex
        companies need to differentiate between young consumers 13  34 and consumers aged 35 to 64 as
         strategies around these different groups have implications on telecoms media and entertainment and
        companies cant see consumers as targets in the process of collecting data and will have to respect
         that consumers own their data and will have to respect the privacy around the data this is particularly
         so in south africa in the context of the protection of personal information act popi
