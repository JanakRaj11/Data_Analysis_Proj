dialog with stakeholders
akkim defines its stakeholders as all people and institutions that are affected by our products
services and operations and that might affect our company in reaching its strategic targets

we reviewed the existing stakeholder portfolio and prepared a stakeholder map during the
sustainability workshop we held in this reporting period with the participation of our senior
management team during prioritization we gave special importance to those that have high
influence on managing our impact on sustainability and those that might be most affected by our
operations g425

in addition to these platforms during the reporting period we held a sustainability awareness
survey with the participation of all whitecollar employees with such practices we ensured
involvement of our employees in the reporting process the survey included questions on all
sustainability issues related to the chemicals industry the two main purposes of the survey were
to improve sustainability awareness in our employees and to receive their opinions on this issue
during the reporting period we run another awareness survey to learn about the opinions of our
dealers on our strategic issues g424

feedback from the dealers revealed that akkims idea of sustainability has positive influence on
the subjects of occupational health and safety 92 improving quality and durability of products
75 and preventing water pollution 75 these subjects completely coincide with the material
sustainability issues we identified in the strategy workshop g427

     efficient use of raw materials
     akkim performs all production operations in its integrated production facilities in other words
     outputs of a facility are used as raw material in another facility this brings us a considerable
     advantage in costs and competition for instance we not only produce and sell hydrogen peroxide
     but also use it as raw material in another facility sodium percarbonate similarly we produce and
     sell methylamines but we also produce dimethylformamide by using these methylamines

     akkim has more than 20 facilities where more than 400 different materials and auxiliary raw
     materials for production we also have a process development  technology transfer unit that
     benefits from the robust engineering infrastructure and team of akkim thanks to this unit we
     monitor efficiency of facilities make improvements where required and increase efficiency of raw
     materials with the changes made in the process the amount of scrap used in ferric iii chloride
     production increased this sets a good example for both efficient use of raw materials and reuse
     of waste materials

     akkim facilities also monitor raw material consumption with process control devices and improve
     processes when necessary raw materials and products are properly stored and checked regularly
     for shelf life thanks to the computerbased storage management system based upon the first in
     first out principle these storage center practices reduce the loss of raw materials

     among practices to involve employees in the resource use processes are including raw material
     efficiency into individual production goals training the staff on raw material efficiency and giving
     instructions to improve raw material efficiency

our environmental
performance

akkök holding shows maximum effort to minimize its environmental impacts and aims to continuously
improve its environmental performance sustainable growth has become one of the most important
current issues in todays world where the natural environment is rapidly getting polluted and sources
getting scarce a member company of akkök holding akkim particularly values environmental
sustainability and aims at producing environmentally friendly products allowing reduction of chemicals
consumption

taking every required measure to prevent environmental pollution in every process and prioritizing
environmentally friendly technologies in line with continuous improvement in all its operations akkim
carefully considers the utility of power and natural resources both during the design of its processes and
during production stages akkim intends to raise awareness on protection of the environment through
cooperation with suppliers and customers and works to reduce its environmental impact not only in
production phases but also during the use of its products

environmental activities are conducted by environmental specialists within health safety environment
hse department all akkim employees are trained and competent in performing environmental as well
as occupational health and safety ohs activities they assume responsibility and actively participate
in improvement efforts improvement of environmental and ohs processes are material issues root
 cause analyses are performed and concluded there are a number of committees to improve these
processes including the suggestion emission seveso prevention of major industrial accidents
energy management odor group ohs committees as well as the akçevre board coordinated by
akkök facilities in yalova

as akkim we provide energy efficiency trainings to all employees waste and energy training was
provided to 14 employees in 2014 and to 445 employees in 2015 akkim allocated try 6540000 for
environmental and waste water treatment practices in 2014 and 2015
                                                                                                             25

     energy efficiency
     efficient use of energy resources energy saving and recovery has become important in every aspect
     of life with technological and industrial advances efforts for establishing the iso 50001 2011 energy
     management systems continued during 2015 to ensure two significant items in akkims agenda 
     sustainability of energy resources and decrease in emission of greenhouse gases and the company
     was qualified for the certificate in october 2015 energy management system is to be integrated in
     existing management systems to maximize the benefits the system is also quite significant for cost
     reduction easier legal compliance regarding ghg emissions increased business performance and
     application to efficiency increasing projects

     akkim purchases a portion of the energy and steam it uses from its sister company aksa akrilik
     and thus achieves cost advantage energy consumption of the facilities is monitored through process
     control devices and improvements are made by production department when necessary in addition
     electricity and steam are directly purchased form auto producer and thus no additional emission is
     caused all forklifts are electrical vehicles causing no fossil fuel consumption or emission

     in the facilities that akkim built with its own knowhow and technology energy efficiency and savings
     are given priority in the selection of processes and equipment for instance while establishing the
     icilicensed chlorine alkali facility in 1992 akkim selected membrane process which is more
     environmentfriendly compared to other processes akkim has been the first company to implement
     the highinvestment membrane technology which does not generate hazardous waste as it does not
     use mercury in the process changes made in regulations in recent years ban the use of mercury
     based systems and therefore other chlorine alkali facilities in the world have recently started to
     replace mercury and asbestosbased processes with membrane systems

     employees are given individual targets not only for raw material efficiency but also for that of energy
     in addition there are company instructions to improve the efficiency of raw materials

     following savings were made during 2014 and 2015 as a result of the activities for increasing
     efficiency regarding power and steam consumptions

      1600000 kwhyear of electric power due to optimization of compressed air consumption in
       spc plant

solid waste management
akkim separately collects and stores wastes in waste stations built within the field and ensure
proper recycling or disposal of wastes according to their qualities hazardous wastes are stored
in standard temporary waste storages built in accordance with related laws and regulations
these wastes are delivered to licensed recycling or disposal institutions by vehicles licensed by
the ministry of environment and urbanization

akkim has a variety of projects to reduce wastes for instance rd works are performed to
ensure that activated alumina wastes used in hydrogen peroxide production are used in the
ceramic industry as raw material or as concrete admixture resulting in recovery of 200 tons of
activated alumina per year in addition personal scorecards of employees include targets for
reducing wastes

another example is hydrochloric acid one of the chemicals produced by akkim and used in
many areas including metal cleaning after being supplied to the galvanize industry hydrochloric
acid is used in metal cleaning and then it becomes waste this waste is called ferric ii chloride
solution or rotten acid the waste is transferred from customers facilities with vehicles licensed
by the ministry of environment and urban planning and is then recovered at akkims ferric
iii chloride facility which is also licensed by the ministry after being processed this waste is
turned into ferric iii chloride ferric iii chloride is used in wastewater treatment with this system
environmental damage to be caused by rotten acid is prevented and the waste is recovered
average amount of rotten acid or ferric ii chloride solution recovered per year is approximately
6000 tons

in addition to performing waste management practices akkim also contributes to such processes
of its customers

collecting the 44 of the paper and plastic packing materials of its products in 2014 and 48 in
2015 akkim contributed in recycling

     water management
     today over one billion people have limited access to drinkablefresh water throughout the world
     where only 25 of the total available water sources are drinkable water shortage could turn into
     a serious crisis in many parts of the world within the next 2025 years therefore efficient use of
     water and treatment  recovery of waste water becomes more and more important every day sea
     water treatment is the alternative solution utilized where the above mentioned methods prove to be
     insufficient

     efficient use and saving of water which is one of the most vital resources for sustainable development
     has an important role in akkims environmental practices akkim procures the water used in its
     two factories in yalova from the gökçe dam and from aksa akrilik which is a sister company utility
     water is received directly from the dam amount of utility water may differ in line with the increase in
     operational activities

     water used in processes is procured from two sources in the southern akkim facilities water from
     the dam is softened before usage whereas in the northern akkim facilities water is received from
     aksa akrilik approximately 6065 of water used in processes becomes product component and
     the rest becomes waste water cooling water is taken from the dam and aksa and used in a closed
     circuit system thus water is added only when there is loss due to evaporationleakage the water
     taken from the dam goes through a treatment system to be used as drinking water

     in the production facilities in çerkezköy untreated water is procured from the well within the borders
     of akkim this untreated water is softened at the akkim facility and then used as process water
     and in steam generation drinking water is outsourced

     the personnel are given periodical training on efficient use of water and water savings recent
     projects enabled significant savings in the amount of water consumed

reuse of waste water
each of the two factories in yalova has its own waste water treatment facility these facilities treat
waste water containing chemicals in the southern akkim facilities domestic waste water is
delivered to the sewage system to be treated at the treatment facility of the municipality whereas
the northern akkim uses the existing waste water treatment facility for domestic waste water

northern akkim waste water treatment facility is composed of physical treatment chemical
treatment biological treatment anaerobicnitrificationaerobic denitrification and sludge
dewatering part the water treated there is then discharged in accordance with the limits stated
in table 1412 of the water pollution control regulations issued by the ministry of environment
and urbanization southern akkim waste water treatment facility uses physical and chemical
treatment the water treated there is then discharged in accordance with the limits stated in
table 19 of the water pollution control regulations issued by the ministry of environment and
urbanization

in addition 14500 m3year waste water generated in the sodium percarbonate facility is
recovered for reuse in the production system in this way not only water saving is achieved
but also loss of products within the waste water is prevented similarly the water regained from
cooling water is used in watering green areas thus enabling approximately 6000 m3year water
saving in the summer

205000 m3year waste water was disposed of through treatment in 2014 and 219350 m3year
in 2015 at akkim yalova plant

     joint treatment plant
     akkök initiated a joint treatment plant project at yalova production facilities in 2012 to make
     the energy and chemicals consumption more efficient under this project the company decided to
     collect the waste water previously sent to different treatment plants and treat this aggregate waste
     water volume in one single plant the joint treatment plants construction began in 2014 upon
     completion of the plant in july 2015 its operation is transferred to yalkim organized industrial
     zone all companies at yalkim organized industrial zone started to send their waste water to
     yalkim organized industrial zone joint treatment plant to be treated

     the joint treatment plant now treating the entire volume of domestic and industrial waste water
     collected from yalkim organized industrial zone companies including akkök holding companies
     aksa akkim and dowaksa is established over approximately 17303 m2 area 18 million usd
     investment was made to establish this plant with a daily waste water flow meeting capacity
     of 15000 m3 the plant includes physical treatment chemical treatment biological treatment
     and sludge dewatering units the majority of the water treatment chemicals utilized in the joint
     plant are provided by akkim in the plant there is also a pilot plant where akkim ultrafiltration
     modules are used

     aim of this project that is implemented to simplify treatment processes by using the synergic effect
     of waste water with different characteristics to allow reuse of water by using advanced treatment
     ultrafiltration technologies to ensure easy operationmaintenance to optimize land and natural
     resource use in the production facility and to sustainably meet future increase in capacity

climate change and emission management
akkim performs the following activities for fighting against climate change and for reduction of
emissions

 selection of suitable technological equipment and process improvement
 assigning an odor team and making odor measurements
 calculating greenhouse gas emissions carbon footprint
 weather modeling
 making internal monitoring measurements

within the scope of these practices akkim pays utmost attention to ensure that the stateofthe
art equipment is purchased for existing or new production facilities and that environmental impact
of such equipment is minimal

with the odor prevention team established with participation from various departments of the
company emission sources in the facility are identified and such emissions are prevented in
addition in conformity with the directive on controlling odorgenerating emissions odor generated
at emission funnels are measured regularly

emissions of facilities are stored in absorbers of process funnels before reaching out to the
atmosphere and are refed into the system this way air quality is maintained resource use is
reduced and chemicals are reused in addition organic steams are burned in the incinerator
system to avoid any environmental damage 1750 tonsyear steam power is generated during
the incineration and this energy is used for heating the facilities

air quality distribution modeling aims to identify how the polluters generated during our operations
dust co nox sox voc etc may be dispersed in the working area under existing meteorological
conditions and what may be the potential ground level precipitation of such pollutants

during air pollution distribution modeling the distribution of air pollutants in the atmosphere
are mathematically simulated by using parameters such as source data meteorological data
land forms etc related computer programs analyze mathematical equalities and algorithms of
pollutants akkim performs all such practices within the coordination of management systems




                                                                                                       31

     with a variety of emission measurement devices akkim makes internal measurements in
     emergencies or predefined periods and thus prevents environmental pollution by timely
     intervention in case of any problems in addition akkim actively participates in activities of
     related nongovernmental platforms public institutions and business world and contributes to
     such practices

     akkim conducts required operations regarding global warming and reduction of gas emissions
     causing global warming the global issue which has gained even more importance after execution
     of kyoto protocol akkim prepares greenhouse gas emission monitoring reports within this
     scope and has delivered the internal greenhouse gas emission monitoring plan to the ministry of
     environment and urbanization in 2014 in accordance with the communiqué on monitoring and
     reporting greenhouse gases the company was qualified in 2015 for iso 14064 greenhouse
     gases inventory forming the basis of activities conducted to reduce carbon emissions with this
     certificate the company made a significant progress towards reduction of its carbon footprint
     through ensuring measurement of current emissions and approval of such measurements by an
     independent body
