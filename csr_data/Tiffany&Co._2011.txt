to that end we work with civil society local communities other jewelry retailers and mining companies

that host mining activities should receive a fair share of minings financial benefits to further their
economic and social development and where precious metals and gemstones are found in places of
extraordinary natural and cultural significance we work to protect those areas from mining for the benefit
of future generations

our sustainability efforts extend beyond our jewelry we work continuously to improve the sustainability
of our blue boxes bags and catalogues by increasing the use of recycled content and fsccertified

tiffany plays a leading role in working closely with the mining industry jewelry industry associations
such as jewelers of america httpwwwjewelersorg  and concerned nongovernmental organizations
such as earthworks and human rights watch to encourage responsible mining practices


   tiffany  co has been an industry leader and an ally in pushing for more
responsible mining and metals production and in taking action to protect
alaskas bristol bay watershed from largescale mineral development
 jennifer krill executive director earthworks httpwwwear thwor ksactionor g

in 2003 tiffany  co helped lead a pioneering multistakeholder conferenceincluding ngos retailers
investors insurers and technical expertsto identify best practices across the entire jewelry supply
chain the resulting dialogue led to the publication of the framework for responsible mining a guide to
evolving standards httpwwwframeworkforresponsibleminingorg  the frameworks goal was to advance
productive debateand ultimately actionby governments retailers civil society the mining industry
and others

tiffany  co was the first jeweler to embrace the objectives of earthworks no dirty gold
httpwwwnodirtygoldorg campaign in 2005 which established aspirational social human rights and
environmental standards for the extraction of gold that retail jewelers can use as they seek responsible
mining sources

tiffany  co continues to cohost and participate in multistakeholder dialogues convened by ngos on
a variety of issues affecting our industry and beyond through these dialogues tiffany  co hopes to
continue to lead the jewelry industry in issues of responsible sourcing

tiffany  co is a founding member of the responsible jewellery council rjc
httpwwwresponsiblejewellerycom  the rjc is an international nonprofit organization established to
reinforce consumer confidence in the jewelry industry by advancing responsible business practices
throughout the diamond and gold jewelry supply chain the rjc developed the principles and code of
practices which outline responsible business practices and to which all rjc members must adhere in
2011 tiffany received rjc member certification demonstrating that we operate in conformity with the rjc
principles and code of practices to obtain a copy of the tiffany  co rjc code of practices policy please

further to develop globally recognized responsible mining standards tiffany  co is working with the
initiative for responsible mining assurance irma httpwwwresponsibleminingnet to establish a
voluntary system of environmental human rights and social standards for mining operations irma
includes participants from ngos labor groups communities affected by mining the mining industry and
the retail sector

irma aims to provide

        independent verification
        fair and equitable distribution of benefits to affected communities while protecting their rights
        effective responsiveness to potential negative impacts to the environment health safety and
        culture

tiffany  co is hopeful that by working collaboratively this diverse group of stakeholders will develop a
consensusbased thirdparty certification standard for responsible mining

statemen t on h ard rock min in g
tiffany  co publicly and actively opposes inappropriate mine development on environmentally and
culturally sensitive lands for example in 2004 through a fullpage advertisement in the w ashington post
tiffany  co urged the united states forest service to deny a permit for the proposed rock creek mine in
the cabinet mountains wilderness in montana

in the us tiffany  co supports the reform of the general mining law of 1872 and legislation to assist
in cleaning up abandoned hardrock mines we agree with many in the environmental community the
mining industry and congress that an overhaul of federal mining law is long overdue tiffany  co also
understands that achieving mining law reform will require hard work negotiation compromise and
creativity in a public transparent process

we believe that mining on our public lands should be a privilege and must be carefully measured against
alternative uses including recreation and conservation most importantly we recognize that some public
lands are simply not suitable for mining and that their value for recreation and conservation is far greater
than their value as a source of minerals

if reforms are to succeed we believe that taxpayers must be fairly compensated for minerals taken from
public lands protection of the environment must be enhanced and business certainty for companies and
communities dependent on mining must be improved

the toxic legacy of abandoned mines in the american west is also a matter of great concern to tiffany 
co under current law government entities ngos private parties and other organizations may incur
liability for voluntarily cleaning up minerelated pollution they did not cause tiffany  co supports
protection of these good samaritans to encourage efforts to effectively deal with these mines and to
establish a permanent source of funding for their cleanup

th e tiffan y  co foun dation
the tiffany  co foundation httpwwwtiffanyandcofoundationorg was established in 2000 to
strategically support the companys core values through focused philanthropic giving one of the
foundations key areas of grantmaking is responsible mining as a part of this program the foundation
supports the development of standards for the responsible mining of precious metals and gemstones at
both an artisanal and largescale level the development of consensusbased thirdparty standards is a
longterm process but essential in moving the industry towards a responsible and sustainable future
the foundation works with a longterm vision on these critical issues additionally the foundation
engages with stakeholders to increase awareness about key issues of importance such as abandoned
mine reclamation

responsible sourcing
    tiffany  co is committed to obtaining precious metals and gemstones and
crafting our jewelry in ways that are socially and environmentally responsible it
is simply the right thing to do and our customers expect and deserve nothing
less
 michael j kowalski chairman and ceo tiffany  co

tiffany  co has long recognized the challenges and complexities of obtaining precious materials that
have been mined processed and crafted in an environmentally and socially responsible manner we
recognize the importance of having a clear understanding of the origins of the materials contained in our
creations so that we can best meet those challenges

tiffany  co actively engages with the mining industry nongovernmental organizations and local
communities to develop responsible operating standards we have developed a comprehensive program to
ensure that human rights and workers rights are respected throughout our supply chain and to encourage
and support community development in the regions where we source our raw materials we believe that
industry and communities can work together to find a balance that will lead to more sustainable practices
in the future

preservation
tiffany  co is committed to minimizing our environmental footprint and
protecting the natural world
we believe that there are certain special places where mining simply should not take place we say this in
spite of its importance to our business and the economic and social benefits that mining can contribute
to communities through the years we have worked to ensure that these special places are permanently
protected from mining and preserved for the enjoyment of future generations

        in 1996 tiffany  co urged the department of the interior not to allow the construction of a gold
        mine that threatened yellowstone national park
        in 2004 through a fullpage advertisement in the w ashington post tiffany  co urged the us
        forest service to deny a permit for the proposed rock creek mine in the cabinet mountains
        wilderness in montana because it would threaten the regions water and wildlife
        tiffany  co has supported congressional efforts to reform the general mining law of 1872 and
        impose more stringent environmental oversight of mining on public lands tiffany  co continues
        to work toward the reform of this antiquated law


   tiffany  co has made sustainability an operating premise of its basic
business model from its commitment to sourcing minerals to its pioneering
work to clean up abandoned hardrock mines in the west to leadership in
advocating that some places such as the headwaters of bristol bay in alaska
should never be mined in a very real sense the partnership between trout
unlimited and tiffany  co is helping to protect and restore the lands and
waters that sustain us as a nation

bristol bay alaska
tiffany  co is working to raise awareness of the risks associated with the development of the proposed
pebble mine in bristol bay alaska home of the worlds most productive salmon fishery the proposed
pebble mine would be among the worlds largest openpit gold and copper mines despite the best of
intentions 175 years of experience sourcing precious metals tells us that there are certain places where
mining cannot be done without forever destroying landscapes wildlife and communities we believe
bristol bay is one such place in 2010 tiffany  co placed a fullpage ad in national geographic
magazine pdfnational geographic_dec_2010_croppedpdf to increase awareness of this issue tiffany
signed the bristol bay protection pledge and declared that should the proposed pebble mine be developed
we will not source gold from it

tiffany  co chairman and ceo michael j kowalski who has made several visits to bristol bay explains

   there are some special places where mining clearly does not represent the
best longterm use of resources in bristol bay we believe the extraordinary
salmon fishery clearly provides the best opportunity to benefit southwestern
alaskan communities in a sustainable way for tiffany  coand we believe for
many of our fellow retail jewelersthis means we must look to other places to
responsibly source our gold
tiffany  co is proud to work with bristol bay native communities concerned scientists sport and
commercial fishermen the conservation community and the many alaskans committed to protecting this
pristine and productive ecosystem




                                                                                                    page 11 of 57

responsible mining
tiffany  co strives to source gemstones and precious metals from mines that conform to high
standards of social and environmental responsibility we have a vertically integrated supply chain and
source directly from the mine when possible this helps ensure quality and chainofcustody for our
products tiffany  co has collaborated with other forwardlooking leaders in the jewelry industry and
with nongovernmental organizations in order to maximize our influence throughout the supply chain

we are most concerned about the impact of large industrialscale mining activities tiffany  co firmly
believes in the following core principles for the responsible development and operation of largescale
mines

      new mine development or expansion of existing mines should never occur in areas of high
      ecological or cultural value specifically mines should never be developed in world heritage sites
      protected areas categorized by the international union for conservation of nature iucn as iiv
      alliance for zero extinction sites or key biodiversity areas
      air water and soil contamination should be prevented
      the principle of informed community participation in mine development and expansion should be
      embraced
      workers rights labor standards and human rights should be respected by all parties
      mine operators should provide for appropriate and fiscally sound guarantees to cover the costs of
      mine closure cleanup and restoration
      mine wastes tailings should not be placed in rivers streams lakes or ocean waters and should be
      disposed of responsibly

we believe that the most important contribution we can make to advance a
responsible sourcing agenda is to use the tiffany  co brand to encourage
jewelry consumers to demand responsibly sourced materials
in order to further an industrywide movement towards responsible sourcing tiffany  co

      works with fellow jewelry retailers the jewelry supply chain mining companies and civil society to
      raise awareness of responsible mining issues and support the development of broadly acceptable
      standards for responsible metal and gemstone mining
      raises our voice to publicly oppose new mine developments that threaten places of high
      environmental and cultural value
      participates in public policy debates as advocates for enhanced regulatory oversight of the mining
      industry where we believe additional oversight is in the public interest
      continually refines our longterm sourcing strategy so that tiffany  co may serve as a model for
      the responsible sourcing of precious metals and gemstones

metals
the silver gold and platinum used in tiffany  cos workshops all of which are located in the united
states come from two principal sources inground largescale deposits of metals that have been
responsibly mined and metals from recycled sources in addition we are exploring the inclusion of
responsibly managed artisanally mined metals although to date we have found it challenging to identify
sources that meet our procurement requirements tiffany  co believes that a sustainable future for
precious metal consumption ultimately depends on the responsible development of all three sources of
metals largescale recycled and artisanal

tiffany  co is committed to using the influence of the tiffany brand among
consumers and within the jewelry industry to support responsible sourcing
practices in the largescale recycled and artisanal sectors
in 2010 tiffany  co manufactured 65 of its jewelry at its united states manufacturing facilities we
choose to source our metals primarily from the united states to minimize supply chain environmental and
social risks in addition our thirdparty vendors also independently source and supply silver gold and
platinum used in finished goods manufactured for tiffany  co these vendors participate in the tiffany 
co social accountability program httpwwwtiffanycomcsrresponsiblesourcingsupplierresponsibilityaspx
to uphold our standards for quality and environmental and social responsibility

silv er
in fiscal year 2010 tiffany  co purchased the silver used in our own manufacturing facilities from two
united states sources 68 of this silver was sourced from the bingham canyon mine in utah as a by
product of an openpit copper mine the remaining 32 was procured from recycled sources

gold
in fiscal year 2010 tiffany  co purchased the gold used in our own manufacturing facilities from two
locations in the united states 64 of this gold was mined from the bingham canyon mine in utah as a
byproduct of an openpit copper mine the remaining 36 was procured from recycled sources

the bingham canyon mine is an existing mine which produces gold as a byproduct of copper mining
using a noncyanide leaching extraction method while there are legacy environmental issues that result
from over a century of mining at bingham canyon the mines owners deserve recognition for acting
responsibly and aggressively to address these issues

platin um
in fiscal year 2011 tiffany  co will begin sourcing platinum directly from stillwater mining in montana
for use within our manufacturing facilities this will include mined platinum as well as platinum recovered
from recycled sources

v en dor crafted jewelry
for jewelry crafted by our manufacturing partners we are working with our vendors to supply them with
precious metal from the same sources that we procure our metals the remaining metal that they
purchase on our behalf is sourced in accordance with tiffany  co standards for quality and
environmental and social responsibility all of these vendors participate in the tiffany  co social
accountability program httpwwwtiffanycomcsrresponsiblesourcingsupplierresponsibilityaspx

tiffany diamonds
tiffany  co is committed to sourcing our diamonds in the most ethical and
environmentally responsible manner
to help maintain the integrity of our supply chain tiffany  co established laurelton diamonds a wholly
owned subsidiary that procures rough diamonds and manages our worldwide supply chain that sources
cuts polishes and supplies finished diamonds to tiffany  co

tiffany  co sources the majority of our diamonds directly from mines in australia botswana canada
namibia russia and south africa and we cut and polish those diamonds in laurelton facilities

tiffany  co believes that diamonds should benefit the economies and societies of diamondproducing
countries we invest in manufacturing operations as well as employee development and training programs
at our cutting and polishing facilities in belgium botswana mauritius namibia south africa and vietnam

tiffany  co purchases diamonds only from those countries that are full participants in the kimberley
process certification scheme kpcs httpwwwkimberleyprocesscomhomeindex_enhtml  further in
fiscal year 2010 over 80 of serialized diamonds in tiffany  cos inventory were purchased directly
either from a mine or a supplier that only sources from known mines

th e kimberley process
the kimberley process is an international cooperative monitoring system created by governments
industry and civil society to eliminate the flow of conflict diamondsrough diamonds that are
smuggled by rebel movements to finance wars against legitimate governments the kimberley process
requires participating countries to tightly control the import and export of rough diamonds also the
kpcs requires governments to establish control systems over private sector trade in rough diamonds to
comply with this process rough diamonds may only move among participating countries in sealed
containers with accompanying documentation evidencing that the diamonds are conflictfree

we applaud the creation of the kpcs built upon the cooperative efforts of governments the diamond
industry and nongovernmental organizations we are encouraged by the progress that has been made
since the system was put in place in 2003 nevertheless it is clear that much work remains to be done

most importantly tiffany  co believes along with many in the diamond industry that the kimberley
mandate should be expanded to ensure that human rights abuses are not associated with diamond mining
in any member country we also urge changes in the peer review process to provide for compliance
assessment and monitoring that is independent and avoids conflicts of commercial and political interest
finally we believe it is prudent to reconsider the current consensus decisionmaking process that
governs the kimberley process and has at times proven challenging for appropriate and timely responses
to noncompliance

    tiffany was quick to respond to the human rights crisis unfolding in
zimbabwes diamond fields it publicly assured its customers that it would not
buy diamonds from zimbabwe and urged for reforms to the kimberley process
so that it could better safeguard human rights tiffany is an example that other
retailers should follow
 arvind ganesan director  business and human rights human rights watch httpwwwhr wor g

con cern in g zimbabwe
regarding the widely reported human rights abuses in the marange diamond district of zimbabwe tiffany
 co joins with other responsible jewelers in condemning those abuses and urges other industry
participants to refuse to purchase diamonds sourced from this district although the quality of marange

business partners of our zero tolerance policy for diamonds of marange origins

gemstones
tiffany  co has developed strict protocols for the sourcing of gemstones tiffany  co currently sells
over 100 varieties of gemstones in relatively small quantities due to the highly fragmented and complex
nature of the gemstone industry traceability levels are not the same for gemstones as they are for
diamonds and precious metals

tiffany  co continuously reviews our supply chain to attempt to find ways to
achieve greater transparency and better assure responsible sourcing
burmese gemston es
rubies are among the worlds most desirable gemstones and many of the finest specimens are mined in
burma myanmar a nation cited for human rights violations in response to these violations the us
government enacted the burmese freedom and democracy act of 2003 forbidding the importation of
products from that nation including rubies and jadeite

tiffany  co is one of the few retail jewelers that has long respected both the letter and the spirit of the
2003 act since that time tiffany  co has refused to buy gemstones that we can reasonably identify as
being of burmese origin regardless of where the gems are cut or polished

in 2008 the passage of the tom lantos block burmese jade act strengthened this prohibition and closed
a major loophole in the previous law that had permitted the importation of burmese rubies and jadeite if
they were cut and polished in other countries




                                                                                                      page 15 of 57

for the protection of coral we support the addition of red and pink coral to appendix ii of the convention
on international trade in endangered species cites which lists species that may be threatened if
international trade is not controlled the cites appendix ii listing is not a ban or a closure of trade
rather it is a mechanism that allows for careful monitoring and oversight requiring that any trade be
based on evidence that the species in question are not threatened by international commerce

operate at the highest standards no less rigorous are the standards used to evaluate tiffany  co
vendors tiffany  co established a multidimensional social accountability program that includes

labor forced labor harassment or abuse disciplinary practices discrimination and environmental
protection

our suppliers are expected at a minimum to conduct business in an ethical manner and to comply with
all applicable laws and regulations our vendor code of conduct communicates our values and
expectations for our business partners in 2010 we modified our supplier requirements so that suppliers
review the vendor code of conduct on an annual basis

to ensure that our suppliers meet tiffany  co standards we have implemented a multiphase
assessment process of our supply chain

   1 vendors are required when applicable to complete a selfassessment of their performance against
      our vendor code of conduct
   2 tiffany  co performs internal audits of our vendors
   3 tiffany  co contracts with a thirdparty social responsibility auditing firm to provide audits on
      our suppliers

2011 cycle 23 of all vendors were classified as highrisk determined by a vendor selfassessment
industry and geographic location in fiscal year 2010 tiffany  co audited 50 of the highrisk
suppliers 95 of these audits were conducted externally and 5 were conducted by tiffany  co internal
audit teams the remaining highrisk suppliers were either terminated in fiscal year 2010 or have audits
planned in fiscal year 2011 in order to perform audits on all of our highrisk suppliers during the two
year audit cycle

when suppliers are found to be in noncompliance with tiffany  co requirements every effort is made to
work with the vendors to correct their noncompliance if the vendor continues to fail to meet our
requirements the relationship is terminated

this threetier system ensures that suppliers meet the rigorous demands of tiffany  cos vendor code
of conduct plus applicable laws and regulations

californ ia tran sparen cy in supply ch ain s act sb657
as referenced above tiffany has a comprehensive supply chain auditing program which addresses the
risks of human trafficking and slavery our audits are conducted both internally and by a third party
thirdparty verification is required of all of our highrisk suppliers determined by a vendor self
assessment industry and geographic location

audits are conducted to evaluate compliance with the tiffany vendor code of conduct as well as local
and international labor laws and regulations

if a nonconformance is found we have a corrective actions process to resolve the nonconformance if
nonconformances persist tiffany ceases to do business with the supplier

tiffany supply chain management have received training on our social accountability program which
includes mitigating risks of human trafficking and slavery within our supply chain
