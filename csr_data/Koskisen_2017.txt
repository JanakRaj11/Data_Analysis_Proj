        2 ceo statement


        koskisen group in 2016
        growth continued for koskisen group in 2016 the groups
        net sales totalled more than eur 264 million up nearly 7 from
        the previous year growth was seen especially in the two largest
        business units  sawn timber and plywood operating profit in
        2016 amounted to eur 42 million a clear decline from the
        previous year koskisens processed wood products were
        delivered to 69 countries around the world exports accounted
        for 54 of the groups net sales

        in 2016 operating profit fell short of the groups targets in all
        business units the profitability of the operations was burdened
        by operational factors and by the inflexibility in the market
        price of softwood logs in relation to the change in the global
        market prices for sawn softwood

        at the end of the year koskisen group had 1087 employees
        more than 120 of whom were employed outside of finland the
        number of employees grew during the year especially in the
        plywood industry following an increase in production volumes
        in the employee satisfaction survey the group received a score
        of 369 on a scale of 15 which is about the same as the
        previous years score

        in october jukka pahta was appointed koskisen groups
        interim managing director and he will continue as the groups
        ordinary managing director as of 1st of march 2017

        the efforts to improve occupational safety continued in 2016
        and resources were also reinforced the groups incident
        density was 35 1 day incidentsmillion working hours the
        outcome is clearly higher than the target and a lot of
        improvements will be needed in the coming years

        customer satisfaction was measured using the nps tool and in
        2016 the outcome was 47 customers especially appreciate the
        high quality of koskisens products and customer service


        during the year investments totalling eur 56 million were made mostly consisting of replacement and upgrade investments in the
        plywood mill and the sawmill the financial administrations it system project was wrapped up and the groups shared document
        management system was rolled out according to plan

        in 2016 koskisen was granted the esteemed national entrepreneurial award by the federation of finnish enterprises as well as the
        key flag symbol by the association for finnish work

        overall 2016 was a challenging year for koskisen despite achieving net sales growth the companys profitability clearly fell short of
        the previous years figures and the set targets despite the underlying uncertainty factors the recovery of the global economy is
        expected to continue and this gives the company a good starting point for the future

        customer satisfaction continuous development of products and services and strengthening competitiveness through cost
        effectiveness and correctly targeted investments will be the keys to koskisens success going forward

                                                                                                                                  5

        safe working
        community
        we want to create a safe pleasant healthy and sustainable
        working community we focus especially on the ergonomics of
        heavy work stages we require our employees to use protective
        equipment at production facilities and we ensure safe
        movement in factory areas we focus on wellbeing at work by
        supporting and organising exercise opportunities during both
        working hours and offhours we encourage our employees to
        develop work safety by rewarding them for providing good
        safety initiatives we rely on the ohsas 18001 to take care of
        our working health and safety levels



        the comprehensive wellbeing of our employees is important to us
        we have our own versatile occupational health service in the facilities of our largest factory area our occupational health service
        professionals know what kind of work we do and recognise the working conditions and are therefore equipped to best support well
        being at work we also employ a physical therapist and a work psychologist a local masseur visits our health service station twice per
        month

        we encourage our employees to take care of their own health for example we support our employees efforts to quit smoking by
        paying for 50 of the detoxification medicine costs we have a group for wellbeing at work that takes care of and organises varied
        work capability functions we provide among other things break workouts nutritional guidance different workout groups and gym
        training at our own gym
        the group for wellbeing at work cooperates for example with our canteen operators who provide healthy fresh food at our local
        workplace restaurants we also try to come up with different freetime events with different themes

        our group holds an annual employee satisfaction survey the results of the survey are reviewed by unit and they are used to pick a
        topic that the unit will then begin to develop human resources takes part in reviewing the results of the survey and monitors the
        outcome employee satisfaction has been on the rise for the last two years in 2016 49  of our employees answered the survey as
        opposed to 53  in 2015 we also managed to reach the set goals well in advance and are now working against our longerterm goal
        of 375  group result unfortunately the trend with sick leaves had an opposite direction the rising figure was caused again by wide
        spread flu attacks in the early and late part of 2016


        companylevel goals 20152017

               sick leaves at 3 in the longterm by 2017 at 35
               factory  production area cleanliness minimising observable targets
               improving the total index of the employee satisfaction survey to 368 by early 2017 with an over 55 employee participation
               rate


        outcome in 2016

               sick leaves at 417
               total index of the employee satisfaction survey at 369




        we want to offer a safe working place to our employees
        ensuring and developing safety at work belongs to everyday routines at koskisen we need to refine both our safety tools and
        working methods and our attitudes in order to reach the goal of zero accidents

        the journey has begun although we realize that there is much to do to reach this ambitious but attainable goal systematic work
        makes the journey possible and keeps us on the right track

                                                                                                                                                20

        by systematic work we mean proactive work and prompt corrective actions we want to minimize the occurrence of dangerous
        incidents deviations from agreed working methods and accidents this is possible through careful risk analysis active safety remark
        system and continuous training of the whole staff the corrective actions aim to eliminate immediate hazardous places and events
        and analyze the cause of these events

        we measure safety both through proactive and corrective or reactive measures taken proactivity is measured as the annual number
        of safety remarks made per employee and the number of safety check made in different work departments corrective actions are
        weighed against the speed and effectiveness of measures taken work related accidents are measured as from the beginning of year
        2017 with metric lta¹ which counts accidents causing one or more sick leave days per million working hours lta¹ is an
        internationally recognized metric and enables to compare ourselves more transparently and clearly with other companies for the
        sake of comparison we have also published the previously used lta4 followup for year 2016

        we have started the longterm journey towards zero accidents and fully believe in positive future safety development in fact some of
        our units have already been able to demonstrate long periods of zero accidents in their daily operations


        group level goal 2017

               lta¹ accident frequency by end of 2017 max 17 accidents causing 1 or more sick leave days  1 000 000 working hours

                quality environment and safety training



        we either provide the vocational training internally or outsource it to an external trainer we use an apprenticeship system to
        organise training for new and old employees apprenticeship training is learning on the job which is supported by knowledgebased
        training
        apprenticeship training is focused on earning a degree degrees our employees can acquire include

                basic degree in process industry either in the sawmill or panel fields
                vocational degrees sawmill or panel process operator power plant maintenance etc
                technical specialist degree management specialist degree product development special degree
                others also possible with planning

        and similarly valued work is the same regardless of gender and we monitor the situation annually with salary reviews we take care
        that our employees are not subjected to bullying discrimination sexual harassment or any other form of harassment our service
        relationships conditions and working conditions are based on equality and fairness

        as members of the corporate responsibility network fibs we have signed a diversity charter on 6 november 2014 with the aim to
        create equal and fair opportunities in our actions that relate to our staff and customers

        53 of our employment relationships have lasted more than 10 years whitecollar relationships have been slightly longer than blue
        collar which is likely explained by difference in the work strain proportion of women has remained at a steady level year to year and
        doesnt really differ in different age groups the share of women of the total work force is approximately one fourth

        average age has risen slightly from 2015 415 and measured 421 in 2016

        environmental thinking
        is at the core of our
        operations
        our business is directly connected to forests that is why we
        have good reason to take care of nature

        we are proud to work among the finnish green gold
        environmental aspects have a strong presence in our rd and
        our choice of suppliers we also aim to minimise the
        environmental impact of our production by using biofuels for
        heating and by paying special attention to waste sorting water
        usage emissions and total energy consumption

        one of our goals is to be a pioneer in implementing
        international environmental standards and to follow the
        principles of sustainable development we are constantly
        evaluating our operations to ensure sustainability and the
        stability of forest growth koskisen has been a pioneer in paying
        attention to the environment in the finnish forest business and
        has received accolades for the actions it has taken koskisen is
        among other things the first finnish wood product company
        that was awarded with the iso 14001 certificate to recognise its
        environmentally friendly operations as early as 1997 in
        addition to that koskisen oy received the iso 9001 quality
        certificate in 1995 and the ohsas 18001 health and safety
        certificate in 2001

                                                                                                                                                     29

        koskisen circular economy
        during the winter of 20152016 koskisen group evaluated the value that circular economy thinking can bring to its business and
        industry in line with leading models developed by the ellen macarthur foundation and sitra in finland minimization of waste of
        efficient usage of raw materials and energy lies at the core of the work the natural steps framework added alignment with the
        cycles of nature and bioeconomy

        in practice this means very efficient material usage at koskisen group as wood and all its residues are utilized as well as possible from
        the point of harvesting to production for example we utilise all the logging waste as energy wood and deliver it to power stations in
        close proximity of the factories the wood chips resulting from sawn goods are delivered for pellet production

        we still have a lot to do however the share of energy waste from the total waste is still too low 39  as compared to our target over
        50 the situation is improving year by year though we are putting a lot of emphasis on improving our recycling processes for
        example since november 2015 we have been testing a special baling machine to gather the plastic covers efficiently bale them neatly
        together and deliver the bale as such to recycling the experiment continues

        we are cooperating with the natural step when developing our circular economy and climate work further

                                                                                                                                                    30

        92 healthy environment  carbon footprint


        koskisen groups carbon footprint
        the carbon footprint is currently the most popular way to measure the impact a company or product has on climate change this
        measure is used by governments companies and individuals alike for koskisen the carbon footprint indicates how much
        greenhouse gases or co²e are emitted by the companys business operations by measuring the carbon footprint a company can
        see which business operations result in heavy co2e emissions while the carbon footprint is a good indicator of the impact of a
        companys operations it does not capture the entire environmental impact

        in 2015 koskisen groups total carbon footprint was 114056 tons of co²e surprisingly the most significant factor in koskisens
        carbon footprint came from materials used to make koskisen products although woodbased materials emit no co2e adhesives
        resulted in significant co²e emissions almost as significant were the emissions caused by logistics that is the transportation of raw
        wood to manufacturing facilities as well as transportation to customers koskisen outsources delivery of its products to customers
        which means that it does not have direct control over the emissions that come from deliveries however it was included in the co2e
        foorprint in order to give a more holistic view of the true climate impact of koskisen products this information is valuable in that it
        can facilitate additional efforts throughout the value chain


        additional facts

                91 of co²e impact comes from outgoing logistics ie transport of finished goods to the customer and 9 comes from
                transporting raw materials to koskisens manufacturing facilities
                internal logistics co²e emissions included forklift trucks and forest machinery

        we focus on energy
        efficiency
        a focus on energy efficiency and increasing use of renewable
        energy are an integral part of our energy use the energy
        efficiency angle we have decided to tackle by joining the
        confederation of finnish industries energy efficiency
        agreement the use of renewable energy has been increased
        thanks to our biofuel heating plant


        aiming for continuous
        improvement in energy
        efficiency
        we joined confederation of finnish industries energy
        efficiency agreement in 2008 including its energy industrys
        operational programme the challenges for energy efficiency
        have been the difficult financial situation and the production
        outages resulting from it the total amount of production at
        production facilities also has an increasing effect on energy
        consumption to reduce energy consumption our employees
        have been instructed among other things to avoid idling
        machinery and to turn off equipment and lights that are not in
        use


        companylevel goal 2015  2017

        to reduce total energy consumption per produced cubic metre
        by 1 per year


        outcome in 2016

        at this moment the total energy consumption for each
        produced cubic metre kwhm3 has been increased by 17 
        when comparing to the level in last year


        companylevel goal 2005  2016

        to reduce the energy needed to produce one cubic metre by
        7 by 2016 when compared to the total energy consumption
        in 2005


        outcome in 2016

        at this moment the total energy consumption for each
        produced cubic metre kwhm3 has been reduced by 225 
        when comparing to the level in 2005



        renewable energy from the side products of our operations
        the koskisen oy järvelä facilities produce heat in their own main boiler facilities koskipower and sermet boilers they mostly use

        wood fuels produces as side products from koskisen oys other operations this means we generally reach a ratio of 95 biofuel in
        heat production we also have six reserve boilers that use heavy fuel oil these boilers are only used if there are issues with the main
        boilers since the founding of koskipower oys heat production facilities in 2006 there has been a noticeable growth in the share of
        renewable energy in our heat production most of koskipower oys heat is used at our own production facilities some of the heat is
        sold externally as district heating for the herrala facility at vierumäki we buy the heating from versowood oy who produce district
        heat using biofuels the hirvensalmi facility gets its heat from our own eteläsavon energia maintained wood and oil boilers


        companylevel goal 2015  2017

        94 healthy environment  water




        water systems are important to us
        the general goal for water use is to reduce the consumption of clean water and the creation of sewage the aim of the operations is
        to harm the water systems in the vicinity of our factories as little as possible


        water consumption is reduced with close monitoring
        koskisen oys järvelä facilities require water for both drinking and for process and cooling in production we get most of our water
        directly from the tolkonlähde and mäntsäläntie factory areas bore well groundwater sources which are owned by koskisen oy
        part of the water we require is drawn from the kärkölä municipalitys water supply system we track our water consumption closely
        which allows us to recognise and fix leaks immediately our aim is to constantly enhance the use of groundwater
        the vierumäki and hirvensalmi operations receive their water from the local water supply systems

        in 2014 water consumption levels were at 034 cubic metres of water for every produced cubic metre

        in 2015 water consumption levels were at 028 cubic metres of water for every produced cubic metre

        in 2016 water consumption levels were at 032 cubic metres of water for every produced cubic metre the development of water
        consumption has been favourable compared to earlier years


        we process sewage appropriately and aim to minimise its amount
        koskisen oy has an industrial sewage supply agreement with the kärkölä municipality log pond water will be pretreated with
        flotation before being supplied to the municipal sewage disposal under normal conditions we completely fulfil the requirements of
        the agreement the sewage produced at the vierumäki and hirvensalmi facilities are supplied to each municipalitys sewage disposal

        941 healthy environment  water  cleaning of kärkölä ground water


        cleaning of kärkölä ground water
        the fire at koskisen oy sawmill in 1976 resulted in a release of the chlorophenolcontaining product ky5 into the soil and the
        aquatic environment ky5 was used to protect lumber against weathering the possibilities for cleaning the groundwater and soil in
        the area have been investigated for decades a breakthrough has taken place in the cleaning efforts during the last two years a
        method developed by koskisen oy and pöyry finland oy has been used to clean a calculated 90 per cent of the groundwater in the
        area the cleaning work will continue so that all of the groundwater can be cleaned

        according to markku koskinen ceo of koskinen oy the supreme administrative court has obligated the company to arrange
        further studies regarding the groundwater in the area and to produce a groundwater reconditioning programme according to
        koskinen though the company wanted to do more together with pöyry finland oy koskisen oy developed a new solution for
        cleaning the groundwater based on biological decomposition by bacteria the method has been utilised in the järvelä region year
        round for over two years


        utilising natures own decomposition process
        in the cleaning process oxygen is absorbed by the soil with groundwater and the bacteria utilise this oxygen in breaking down
        chlorophenols the natural bacterial strain uses oxygen to break down the chlorophenols present in groundwater and soil into water
        and carbon dioxide no harmful compounds or end products are formed as the cleaning process takes place underground this
        method does not put the environment or the areas residents at risk

        hydrogeologist petri siiro has supervised the cleaning operation as the representative of the ely centre for häme and he considers
        the situation good
        the actions aimed at cleaning the groundwater have been performed commendably and in good cooperation between koskisen oy
        and the ely centre the cleaning results have been very promising and the goal of achieving groundwater in good condition
        compliant with the water framework directive and the act on water resources management will probably be achieved by 2027
        siiro says

        koskisen oy and pöyry finland oy believe that in the future it will also be possible to apply this cleaning method to other areas where
        the groundwater is spoiled by biodegradable organic substances

                                                                                                                                                40

        nature and industry in harmony at the hähkäjärvi
        lakes shores
        hähkäjärvi is a companyowned lake in the immediate vicinity of koskisen oys tehdastie factory the lake was formerly used to store
        logs which caused wood material to accumulate to the lake bottom such as tree bark as the wood material decays it releases
        nutrients into the lake while also consuming oxygen because of this the lake has become heavily euthrophic the lakes nitrogen and
        phosphorus concentrations are many times higher than the average but the lakes status is slowly improving as it is no longer subject
        to an external nutrient load

        we avoid drawing water from hähkäjärvi by the lakes shore we have built closedcircuit pools for circulating log irrigation water
        which enable us to recycle that water for log irrigation we do not draw any log irrigation water from hähkäjärvi as the irrigation
        water is in closed circulation the only sources of overflow to the lake from the factory area are rainwater and clean cooling water

        koskisen oys environmental permit includes a provision for restoring hähkäjärvi we have commissioned reports on the need for
        restoration and presented them to the authorities
        the latest report the hähkäjärvi nature report was completed in 2014 the report concluded that the area is home in addition to a
        diverse birdlife to protected moor frogs and bats hähkäjärvi and its shores are a valuable habitat for many animals because of its low
        use which makes it an apt example of the coexistence between industry and environment

                                                                                                                                                41

        95 healthy environment  emissions


        the objectives clean air and a quiet environment
        we monitor our air emissions actively and constantly aim to reduce them some good results have been achieved with certain air
        pollutants and the research continues on the noise pollution situation varies but we try to tackle sources of noise as soon as they
        manifest

        reducing noise pollution improves both our employees wellbeing and that of the residents of the surrounding area
        our tehdastie factories in järvelä are right next to the kärkölä town centre therefore local residents wellbeing gives us a good
        reason to pay special attention to noise control fuel shredding is one of our noisiest operations and we have sought many solutions
        over time to reduce the harm  we have built noise barriers and limited the shredding activities to certain times of day
        in 2014 we received a large amount of feedback of the sawmills new conveyor and we managed to eliminate the noise it caused with
        minor changes in 2015 and 2016 we contacted by factory noise this problem was solved by closing door for the night


        environmentally friendly raw material
        our group provides its own contribution in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and in mitigating climate change a significant
        advantage for our business is the renewable carbonbinding raw material we use  wood photosynthesis means that the wood
        absorbs carbon dioxide from the air which is then stored for a long time sustainable wood products keep that carbon bound
        throughout the products lifecycle in heat production our aim is to keep the share of fossil fuels as low as possible and therefore
        reduce our carbon dioxide emissions the heating plants at both factories in järvelä are included in emission trading which means
        their operations are monitored reported and externally audited as required by the emission trading act some of our products
        have already had their carbon footprints calculated and our goal is to extend those calculations to the entire group


        emission monitoring enables the detection of targets for
        development
        the koskisen oy järvelä factories produce air emissions from production processes and from energy production these emissions
        include sulphur dioxide so 2 nitrous oxides nox voc emissions volatile organic compounds carbon dioxide co 2 and dust
        emissions we monitor our air emissions actively and constantly aim to reduce them we have had good results on reducing
        especially our sulphur dioxide and dust emissions in 2004  2015

        the california air resources board carb has granted us an exemption on external formaldehyde emission audits to our plywood
        products the reason for this is that we use ultralowemitting formaldehydes ulef in our plywood products which complies with
        the tightest carb standard phase 2

        actions to reduce waste
        we handle the recycling and reuse of the waste generated in our production we monitor the amount of generated waste constantly
        and take actions to reduce the amount of landfill waste to demonstrate this we are included in the ministry of the environments
        sustainable development challenge sitoumus 2050

        koskisen oy sitoumus2050fi see english version


        the reduction of all but especially landfill waste is our goal
        in order to reduce waste we strive for precise sorting which keeps the amount of landfill waste as low as possible waste sorting
        saves not only the environment but also money as energy waste processing costs half as much as landfill waste processing we sort
        the following recyclable and reusable waste fractions cardboard paper metal electric and electronic waste sorting has been
        enhanced in 2014 by for example improving the sorting in our cafeterias offices and social areas in 2015 the most significant
        change was a material utilization of alumium coated plywood this decreases the amount of landfill waste the promotion of waste
        sorting and recycling poses the challenge of getting the groups entire staff to be aware of the right attitudes and practices
        hirvensalmi does not provide local energy waste collection which makes sorting difficult for the birch product industry and the
        kissakoski sawmill


        companylevel goal 20152017

        the share of energy waste in the total amount of landfill and energy waste at 50


        outcome in 2014

        the järvelä and vierumäki operations share of energy waste was at 354 which a worse situation compared to previous years the
        reason for this is that the factories have cleaned out unusable nonenergy waste material during 2014


        outcome in 2015

        the järvelä and vierumäki operations share of energy waste was at 375 which a better situation compared to previous years
        waste sorting has been developed and enhanced in 2015


        outcome in 2016

        the järvelä and vierumäki operations share of energy waste was at 390 which a better situation compared to two previous years


        our main raw material wood is a multiuse renewable and
        biodegradable material
        we use every part of a tree we can logs we use to make plywood and lumber pulpwood we send to paper and cellulose production
        and the lap wood ie twigs and stumps we use as biofuel if possible

        the side products of our refining processes are used in our own heating plant in addition to our products being recyclable most of
        our packaging is as well

        we use the sawdust and chippings produced in our other operations to make chipboard in addition wood the chipboard and
        plywood industries use different glues and coatings as material the material for our sawmills is finnish pines and firs we are the only
        finnish wood buyer that also uses part trunks where the uncut log part is brought to the factory for cutting in an economic way that
        uses the length of the entire trunk in addition to being more economical this harvesting method increases the efficiency of material
        usage and through that energy efficiency


        we aim to reduce the amount of dangerous waste
        the dangerous waste produced in our operation is delivered to riihimäki for appropriate processing at ekokem oy glue and oil

        efficiency and nature go hand in hand when it comes to transportation the more efficient and economical our deliveries to our
        customers the less we use fuel and produce emissions we aim to minimise the environmental effects of our transports by using
        appropriate transport units that are as large as possible and by improving the utilisation rate of transport space we additionally rely
        on the carriers other transport needs and existing distribution channels
        we develop reporting and tracking tools with our main partners to help with operational development

        the location of our customers shipping conditions ordered products and their amount and the required delivery times define the
        transport method used we choose an appropriate transport method for every need the transport methods for delivering products
        change by unit and market area car transports are primarily used in finland with exports being transported by trailer container and
        ship freight we only use air freight if a customers delivery time requires it

        the share of exports varies significantly between our business units most of our house industry products are sold in finland with
        90 of our superior plywood products being exported

        we favour reliable and efficient carriers who operate in a responsible manner

        we want to consider the environmental point of view when it comes to staff mobility that is why we have written the koskisen oy
        travel guidelines when travelling on business our staff uses the cheapest appropriate method and route of travel when considering
        their task we recommend that our staff uses public transport as much as it is possible the use of public transport creates a challenge
        because of our office locations

        todays technologies make it possible to hold meetings or training sessions online which serve to save both costs and time we have
        begun to use the lync service which has reduced the amount of necessary business trips

        some of our employees perform tasks that require the use of their own cars these employees will receive company cars on the
        recommendation of their responsible manager we have written a koskisen oy car policy to support the acquisition of company
        cars the car policys environmental considerations state that company cars must have good mileage and low carbon dioxide
        emissions under 140gkm it also recommends that the cars combined fuel consumption stays below 6 litres per 100km

        part trunk method
        precise utilisation of raw material is a benefit to both our factories and the wood sellers by optimising the cutting in the forest we can
        ensure that trees are used as efficiently as possible by our factories  this also serves to ensure the precision in recovering logs from
        the forest owners point of view the part trunk method we use in wood procurement is unique in finland this method involved
        cutting only the fibre section from the trunk logs with the logs being transported to our sawmill as 1220 metre trunks we use this
        method in final cutting areas that are heavily coniferous the part trunk method and long trunk logs make it possible for our sawmills
        to deliver lumber to our customers quickly and flexibly

        tapios forestry recommendations it is a guideline on financially ecologically socially and culturally sustainable forestry created by
        operators in the forest business the best practices for forestry that aims to preserve the diversity of nature are for example
        preserving valuable habitats and the living areas of endangered species and leaving retention and deadwood in the forest during
        cutting we live off the forest  that is why its our responsibility to take care of them

        the wood we use originates from sustainable sources
        wood procurement is handled by our groups parent company koskitukki oy who also provide wood for other factories in
        southern finland most of our wood comes from finnish private forests mainly in southern and eastern finland a small portion of
        our birch logs are imported mainly from russia imported wood is required because the availability of finnish birch does not always
        cover the plywood industrys material needs we have been managing the origin chain of our wood since the year 2000 according to
        the pefc system and in 2013 we were also awarded with the fsc coc certificate these certificates ensure that wood is not
        procured from socalled controversial sources and that conserved forest areas are reserved for future generations over 80  of the
        purchased wood comes from certified forests in 2015 our production facilities used a total of approximately 11 million cubic
        metres of wood
