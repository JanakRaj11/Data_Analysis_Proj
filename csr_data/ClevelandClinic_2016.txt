materiality

while all sustainability topics discussed in this report are important to our leadership our stakeholder engagement
process has helped us determine what sustainability topics matter most or how material they are to our
operations and where they matter most within our organization and externally beyond our walls this materiality
process has enabled us to prioritize the topics that require the most focus for our longterm success

all interviewed stakeholders were given a list of sustainability topics based on the global reporting initiatives
aspects list and engaged in open dialogue on all topics the internal interview team ranked each topic discussed on
a low to high scale of 1 to 7 and then the mean of all stakeholder answers was utilized to generate vertical and
horizontal points on the graph the opinions of our patients and caregivers were weighted with additional
consideration




serving our present caring for our future                                                                             5

the verticalaxis of the chart corresponds to the ranking or importance of a topic to our external stakeholders and
the horizontalaxis corresponds to the importance to our internal stakeholders

the chart is divided into three distinct groups topics to manage topics to set goals and manage and topics to set
goals manage and provide robust discussion in our reporting

several topics emerged that were ranked highly by both our internal and external stakeholders they are the
indirect economic impacts of our operations our engagement with the communities we serve population health
research and innovation access to care quality of care and the inherent link between human health and the health
of the environment other highly ranked topics internally were caregiver engagement care transformation patient
and caregiver safety and transparency one important topic that was discussed extensively by our external
stakeholders was the health impact climate change poses to our patients and communities and cleveland clinics
mitigation and resilience efforts

generally the most important topics discussed internally concerned our patients and caregivers and our external
stakeholders cared most about our community and environmental impacts where available we have included
robust discussion and reporting on the topics our stakeholders consider to be the most material to our operations in
this years report we will continue to use this materiality process to guide our reporting and data collection in the
future




serving our present caring for our future                                                                             6

    improving the patient experience

    we spend a lot of time thinking about how to define the patient experience and perhaps the answer is
    that patients define their own experience we just have to be willing to see it and adapt our models
    delivery systems and care paths to them

    cultural shift

    cleveland clinic recognizes the patient and the caregiver have reciprocal influence and we believe this
    relationship is morally valuable to nurture this connection and improve patient satisfaction cleveland clinic
    began an initiative that partnered our institutes and community hospitals with the office of patient experience
    ope

    over the last several years ope has helped to support a concerted effort to build and sustain a culture of
    service excellence across the entire enterprise programs such as communicate with heart  empower
    all caregivers to put patients and visitors first at every discussion interaction and encounter by applying
    standard service behaviors



    transparency

    we publicly share patient experience ratings with the general population and with all physicians and nursing
    units visitors to our website can see how other patients have rated our individual physicians and at any time
    our caregivers can track their areas patient satisfaction ratings and feedback on our internal patient
    experience dashboard



    standardization

    we are working towards standardizing not only clinical care but also emotional and empathetic care across
    the enterprise to nurture the experience patients have under our care this is accomplished by engaging with
    our caregivers around our established nine expected service behaviors sharing of best practices across the
    system and the work of our patient experience managers who are staffed across our regional hospitals
    these patient experience managers work hard to engage caregivers to help solve the unique patient
    experiencerelated challenges at each hospital and with every patient interaction

    meanwhile physicians and advanced care providers are offered communications skills training through the
    rede to communicate program this relationshipcentered model managed by the center for
    excellence in healthcare communication aims to increase the value of the providerpatient interaction and to
    improve patient engagement and active participation into their care

care transformation
the us healthcare system is in the midst of an unprecedented transformation we continue to draw upon our
deep capabilities and spirit of innovation to lead the field in creating a model of healthcare for the future some of
the most perplexing issues can be solved by answering the simple question what is best for the patient our
mission is to provide better access quality and affordability to all of our patients here is how we are working to
achieve this goal



research  innovation

               over the past 13 years cleveland clinic has held a medical innovation summit the medical
               innovation summit reflects cleveland clinics longstanding commitment to innovation in healthcare
               each year it offers thoughtprovoking panels oneonone discussions with influential ceos and
               discovery of marketready technologies many in our field consider the medical innovation summit to
               be the single essential meeting for innovation and technology at the leading edge each summit has
               raised the understanding of new technology its potential as medical products and established a
               meeting ground for innovation leaders worldwide to engage each other



carepaths

               care paths are multidisciplinary plans of care that limit variation in care and optimize outcomes
               providers base treatment on documented evidence or shared experience to deliver consistent value for
               a patient or population of patients

               the care path initiative focuses on three main objectives

                   standardizing physician clinical management with a focus on valuebased patientcentered care

                   integrating work flows and algorithms into the electronic medical record when appropriate

                   tracking patientreported outcomes to improve care quality


               we currently have 95 care paths in development and 35 undergoing operational pilots our complete
               care program is a team approach that includes the patient the surgeon and a specialty care
               coordinator this bundled treatment plan along with a bundled payment plan provides efficient care for
               the patient



care coordination

               every patient deserves the same safe quality care at every encounter care coordination is a patient
               centered providerdriven collaborative approach to costefficient healthcare delivery care
               coordinators provide highrisk patients with support to help them meet their clinical goals and achieve
               better outcomes in the new valuebased healthcare model our caregivers work to help these patients
               achieve optimal health


serving our present caring for our future                                                                               19

distance health

               clinic is bringing our care to more patients in more locations we increased our telemedicine presence
               and opened more urgent care walkin clinics throughout our community our efforts to enhance
               accessibility allowed us to see a record 66 million outpatient visits in 2015 additionally the number
               one ranked medical innovation of 2015 was the mobile stroke treatment unit this hightech
               ambulance brings the emergency department directly to the patient with stroke symptoms



patientcentered medical home

               a patientcentered medical home might sound like a place or somewhere you would go but it is not it
               is a longterm teambased approach for your primary healthcare patients are engaged with their care
               team across the continuum and have a direct relationship with their provider who coordinates a team of
               caregivers and arranges appropriate treatment as needed

               in 2013 the joint commissions surveyors evaluated us on how effectively primary care clinicians and
               interdisciplinary teams work in partnership with patients to provide comprehensive coordinated and
               patientcentered care the primary care medical home certification was launched for hospitals in
               february 2013 to help improve outcomes reduce healthcare costs and ensure patients receive timely
               and appropriate treatment as an outcome of the joint commissions survey 39 medicine institute
               practices at 29 sites  involving 230 primary care physicians and advanced practice nurses

enterprise patient falls prevention initiative

falls can result in significant patient harm in 2015 cleveland clinic established a multidisciplinary enterprise
patient falls committee the enterprise fall goals are 0 patient falls with significant harm 90 of patients identified
as a fall risk had a fall management plan in place by the end of 2015 and we implement interventions that will
support a 15 decrease in all patient falls inpatient and outpatient in 2016

caregivers can be injured while attempting to prevent a fall or while lifting a fallen patient programs that prevent
patient falls will help prevent related caregiver injuries one team focused on how the physical environment might
contribute to falls the team developed assessment tools for inpatient and outpatient areas and made facility design
recommendations including adoption of the facilities guidelines institute fgi patient handling white paper work
on this important initiative continues into 2016



bloodborne pathogens

bloodborne pathogen bbp exposures cause the greatest number of injuries at cleveland clinic and reducing
these exposures is our goal in 2015 an enterprise steering committee was established to provide executive
oversight advocacy support common messaging performance expectations and decision making for the initiative
education auditfeedback and equipmentenvironment subteams were established to focus on specific elements
of bbp exposure reduction an implementation guide was developed and a goal of reducing bloodborne pathogen
exposures by 20 from 2014 was established in addition the definition of bloodborne pathogen was expanded
from the osha regulatory definition to exposure to any body fluid including urine feces spit and vomit

local prevention teams are being rolled out in three phases the first phase covered 31 of enterprise bbp
exposures and consisted of five main campus institutes and four regional hospitals the second phase covered
58 of exposures and includes the remainder of the main campus institutes and regional hospitals the third
phase covers the ambulatory surgery centers ascs weston florida and akron general medical center best
practices are shared monthly among the various local prevention teams

a work unit based bloodborne pathogen trainer course was revised to create a more active role for the trainers and
145 bloodborne pathogen exposure prevention champions were trained in 2015 champions are expected to
review personal protective equipment use evaluate sharp safety equipment for their work units and report their
findings to their local prevention team and the education subcommittee they are also expected to work with
caregivers on their units to develop an individual bbp exposure reduction goal bloodborne pathogen exposure
numbers are distributed throughout cleveland clinic so employees can see how exposures are occurring and take
steps to prevent future exposures

exposures at the main campus in 2015 increased by about 11 over 2014 exposures but this may be due to the
expanded definition of exposure and increased caregiver focus on reporting the chart below shows occupational
safety and health administration osha regulatory definition exposures and the increase is less the goal for
2016 is set at a 25 reduction and exposures will be monitored carefully in 2016 to see if the reduction efforts
implemented are effective

at the tier 2 level we simplified our reporting of diverse spend thus opening up more categories to inclusion in our
efforts to grow a more diverse supplier base in addition to working to create more opportunity for minority
women and veteranowned firms we added historically underutilized businesses hubzone and lgbtowned
businesses to our focus

construction management and design firms with larger mentor firms we are partnering to grow the capacity and
experience within healthcare of the minority firms over time and have seen several success stories from this effort

mobile food pantry

stephanie tubbs jones health center stjhc sponsors a mobile food
pantry in east cleveland on the 4th saturday of each month in
collaboration with the greater cleveland food bank the mobile food
pantry operates like a farmers market but the food is given away to
community members for free

the east cleveland community is a food desert lacking easily accessible
grocery stores that provide fresh produce this disparity impacts the
community through high rates of obesity diabetes and hypertension the
mobile food pantry provides healthy meal options for families promotes
healthy eating and improves health outcomes in 2015 we maintained the
mobile food pantry year round moving the pantry inside during the cold
months when there is even less availability of fresh produce in the
community we have also teamed up with coit road farmers market to
provide free cooking and exercise classes during each mobile food
pantry the cooking class utilizes produce from the pantry to teach
families how to cook it in healthy ways and the exercise class incorporates
normal household items into a routine that can be done at home without
any special equipment

research has shown that adding just two servings of fruits and
vegetables a day to your diet can help to combat most chronic illnesses
which makes access to food is not just a social concern but also a medical one said alicia richardson former
stjhc patient navigator dedicated to the mobile pantry and its purpose most importantly when someone is
hungry accessing food becomes their primary concern and their healthcare is put on the back burner

each month the greater cleveland food bank provides stjhc with 10000 to 12000 pounds of fresh produce to

healthy buildings

we recognize that people living in a healthy environment will be healthier people our buildings support the health
of our caregivers patients and communities in 2015 we continued to grow and set new standards for our buildings
and development we have 4 leed gold and 9 leed silver projects and almost all cleveland clinic main campus
construction projects seek to be leed silver or higher



responsible procurement

we purchase thousands of different products each year that are utilized throughout the care of our patients we are
working to reduce unnecessary packaging and evaluate our purchasing decisions based on their environmental
impacts so that we can eliminate items that may be toxic to our patients and caregivers



innovative leadership

our involvement at multiple levels from global to local has made us a veritable leader in sustainable healthcare
we work in collaboration with governments nongovernmental organizations ngos and communities to support
strategies for mitigation and adaptation we engage with these groups and provide leadership in both thought and
practice



water stewardship

freshwater resources such as lake erie and the cuyahoga river represent an invaluable local asset that has
shaped clevelands identity both in the way that the city has perceived itself and how it has been recognized
outside the region as stewards of our communitys health we see preservation of our communitys natural

energy conservation
cleveland clinics energy management work is an outgrowth of our sustainability commitment to our patients
community and caregivers as population health payment models proliferate the linkage between energy pollution
and human health intensifies energy efficiency is more aligned to our core mission than ever before

cleveland clinics commitments to both affordable care and our external partnerships with energystar and the
better buildings challenge drive us to become 20 more energy efficient by 2020 from a 2010 baseline in 2015
cleveland clinic continued implementing a 12 million enterprise energy demand reduction strategy to improve our
energy efficiency and become less resourceintensive by decreasing energy intensity cleveland clinic is providing
value for our patients and leading the industry in responsible healthcare operations




reduction progress

energy use intensity or eui measures the energy consumed by a building relative to its size cleveland clinic
uses weather normalized source eui which includes transmission delivery and production losses of the source
fuels as they are used for energy our goal is to reduce our eui to 393 by 2020 as of december 2015 we have
reduced our eui by 124 from our 2010 baseline cleveland clinics building portfolio is 161million ft2 excluding
parking lots and garages with 207m ft2 including them




progress highlight

cleveland clinics hillcrest hospital implemented a variety of energy reduction strategies that contributed to its
overall eui reduction in 2015 hillcrest hospital reduced its energy intensity more than 10 from its 2014 baseline
and became the first hospital in our enterprise to reach its reduction goal of 20 overall hillcrest hospital has
reduced its eui 224 from its 2010 baseline the department of energy recently showcased the project on the
better buildings challenge website

strategy implementation

our implementation strategy is fully resourced and supported by our executive leadership this support includes
initial capital spending and incentives realized from energy savings operational savings obtained are shared with
building facility managers and operations teams to fund additional energy efficiency improvements this helps to
generate momentum and employee ownership of our energy policies we allocated 14 million specifically for high
payback energy projects




light emitting diodes led retrofit

just keeping our lights on accounts for 16 percent of our total energy use the cost of leds has reached the point
where the payback makes sense even in ohio where electricity prices are low relative to other regions cleveland
clinic is standardizing 100 led for new construction and replacing approximately 250000 fluorescent tubes
some of the benefits from this initiative include

   cutting our electric consumption by 28600000 kilowatts each year  roughly the same as removing
   approximately 2600 houses off the electrical grid  for a total annual savings of 2 million

   reducing our carbon footprint by nearly 19400 tons of co2 annually  equivalent to taking 3600 cars off the
   road

   decreasing our waste because led lights last nearly 25 times longer than fluorescent lights  and they are
   mercuryfree which translates into safer disposal

   creating nearly 20 new jobs in our community between 510 in manufacturing and 10 in installation


serving our present caring for our future                                                                         69

we have partnered with energy focus a leading provider of energy efficient led products and developer of energy
efficient lighting technology which is located in solon ohio the led lighting project will create up to 10 new
manufacturing jobs at energy focus and they have already hired individuals from our center for autism
additionally 10 new installation jobs have been created for the evergreen cooperatives

                                            waste and emissions while providing the highest quality medical care in
                                            2014 we launched an enterprise wide ecocaregivertm training energy
                                            savings  you this mandatory training on energy demand management
is required for all caregivers and continued throughout 2015 nine months postlaunch more than 49000
caregivers across the enterprise have completed the training this 15minute module will be updated and
reassigned annually for all caregivers including staff it reinforces an organizational expectation for an environment
of energy conversation and emphasizes the importance of individual caregiver contribution to our energy demand
reduction goals in addition to the training we have developed a robust communications campaign to prompt
desired workplace behaviors



operating room or setbacks

heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac is the single most energyintensive component in our energy profile
51 there are 215 operating rooms ors across our health system 86 on our main campus running multiple
cases per day because of the ors requirements for air changes per hour strict temperature and humidity
parameters pressure relationships and energyintensive and often heatgenerating surgical lighting systems or
hvac systems came into sharp focus as our largest strategic priority for energy demand reduction

in 2015 in collaboration with the surgical operations executive committee the facilities department implemented
an or setback plan to reduce energy while maintaining state and federal regulations for air exchange



lighting setbacks  behavior

building setbacks and caregiver education offer significant energy reduction opportunities we have programmed
our lighting systems to reduce usage during unoccupied periods for administrative areas and are creating a culture
of conservation through an enterprise wide caregiver training initiative



chiller optimization  replacement

in partnership with gardiner trane we implemented several chiller optimizations on main campus and several other
hospitals chillers are machines used for cooling our facilities and contribute a significant portion of our hvac
costs we anticipate savings of 650000year based on internal studies and an external study performed by a third
party

we replaced medina hospitals 57 yearold boiler with a highefficiency ondemand miura boiler which is expected
to save more than 250000 in energy costs per year and to deliver significant reductions in co2 emissions
medina hospital reduced its eui 14 in 2015 from its december 2015 baseline and won the ohio hospital

associations energy cup for greatest yearoveryear reduction for a large hospital this reduction was more than
21 times the national average



filter optimization

we initiated a filter optimization program to replace highefficiency particulate arrestance hepa filters with 14 high
efficiency filters for nonsurgical spaces and utilize a more energy efficient filter package across the system the
conversion is projected to save approximately 23 in fan power for all affected air handling units with variable
speed drives and deliver almost 1 million in savings



retrocommissioning

we optimized equipment condition controls and programmed operating conditions to achieve a 40 savings at our
strongsville family health and surgery center additional facility retrocommissioning is planned in the future



integrated building management system ibms

we integrated meter installations and developed energy dashboards to provide detailed building by building energy
metering and monitoring this resulted in caregivers competing to control their respective buildings at the lowest
energy use per square foot




utility bill management

we utilize a third party firm to manage all of our utility bills in addition to processing utility invoices this firm
performs extensive data mining and analytics at the building level offering assurance of facility performance over
time

energy efficiency

in 2015 cleveland clinic continued implementing a 12m enterprise energy demand reduction strategy to improve
our energy efficiency and become less resourceintensive by decreasing energy intensity cleveland clinic is
reducing our carbon footprint providing value for our patients and leading the industry in responsible healthcare
operations as of december 2015 we have reduced our eui by 124 from our 2010 baseline



carbon mitigation




cleveland clinics 2015 scope 1  2 carbon footprint totaled 452062 metric tons of co2e this is a 45 reduction
from 2014 and an 84 reduction from 2012 75 of our footprint is from purchased electricity 23 is from direct
usage of fuels in assets owned by cleveland clinic and 2 is from anesthesia gases more than 96 of our carbon


serving our present caring for our future                                                                         72

footprint is located in northeast ohio in our hospitals family health centers medical office buildings and
administrative facilities




cleveland clinic calculated its scope 1  2 carbon footprint using the ghg protocol for electricity natural gas fuels
used by generators and vehicles and anesthesia gases energystars portfolio manager was used to calculate
the electricity carbon footprint since it utilizes site specific egrid factors for each location for locations not tracked
in portfolio manager a system average factor was applied to the electricity usage natural gas footprint was
calculated using fuel usage for our owned fleet of patient transport vehicles vans and cars was drawn from our
central fleet management group anesthesia gas emissions were calculated based on purchased cylinder volumes
and intensity factors from carbon footprint from anesthetic gas use study published by uks sustainable
development unit in 2012

ohios total carbon footprint in 2011 was 233 million metric tons according to the us epa thus cleveland clinics
scope 1 and 2 footprint would represent 02 of ohios total carbon footprint



healthcare climate council

in 2015 cleveland clinic joined health care without harms climate council the council is open to hospitals and
health systems that recognize climate change is one of the single largest threats to public health and committed to
addressing its health impacts the councils mission is to amplify public and private responses to climate change
by

   accelerating investment in renewable energy and efficiency

   scaling the healthcare sectors adoption of climate change mitigation and resilience programs and

   advocating for local state and national policies that ensure a sustainable and healthy future


as a leader in healthcare and an anchor institution in our communities cleveland clinic recognizes that our
response to these challenges will guide the evolution of our organization in the coming decades we look forward to
collaborating with other council health systems




serving our present caring for our future                                                                               73

clean power plan advocacy

when the white house environmental protection agency and surgeon general wanted to explore the effects of
climate change on health they reached out to nationally recognized experts in a variety of fields our own sumita
khatri md codirector of the asthma center represented the voice of the physician and ultimately the patient

sumita traveled to the nations capital to participate in a summit on climate change and the important role the public
health community can play in communicating and preventing its impact she described the respiratory effects she
sees in her practice but more importantly what our role should be in addressing the problem

in closing her remarks she said we should all strive to make our practices and our policies result in the cleanest
air possible so that collateral good from these efforts can have positive downstream health effects on our most
valuable currency  our people

the clean power plan will help cut carbon pollution from the power sector 30 from 2005 levels because carbon
pollution contains many other particles that are dangerous to health the clean power plan will avoid

   3600 premature deaths

   1700 heart attacks

   90000 asthma attacks

   300000 missed work  school days


the clean power plan is the cornerstone to the united states climate change commitment during december
2015s communication of parties cop21 in paris france where leaders from around the world came together to
agree to limit global carbon emissions

in 2015 the office for a healthy environment formed an inter
departmental zero waste committee with the goal of reaching a 50
landfill diversion rate or more by the end of 2017 our enterprise recycling
rate fluctuates between 30 to 40 and to combat stagnation in
improvement we conducted waste audits at several of our hospitals to
identify potential opportunities even in the frigid air of ohio in january
passionate caregivers audited the trash of hillcrest hospital and were able
to identify nearly 800 pounds that could be diverted from the landfill




purple bag expansion




in 2015 we completed a systemwide expansion of our clinical plastics recycling program that was created by
cleveland clinic in partnership with buckeye industries and our waste vendor in 2015 we increased our diverted
tons of clinical plastics from 96 to 193 tons via this innovative partnership as well as created more than 50 jobs for
community members with developmental disabilities participating facilities competed on a monthly basis to see
which team of caregivers could divert the most clinical plastics from the landfill in 2015 in excluding main campus
fairview hospital diverted the most with an annual total of 22 tons

see our 2014 ungc report for a detailed program summary



single stream paper shredding  recycling

we offer a single stream paper shreddingrecycling program to our facilities to further protect the personal
information of our patients and to simplify the collection process for our employees all paper regardless of the
sensitivity of the document is collected in our secured shredding containers when this program became
operational in 2010 we observed an increase on the order of 44 in the amount of paper captured in our secure
serving our present caring for our future                                                                           78

shredding bins not only does this program improve our hipaa compliance as we shred all paper simplify the
collection process for our employees but it also reduces cost as we have leveraged the value of our paper waste
commodity to negotiate lower service rates this program is now among our lowest cost methods of recycling or
disposal

in 2015 we recycled over 3300 tons of paper which has preserved over 56000 trees



single use device reprocessing

in the past when clinical instruments were unused but removed from their packaging presurgery in our ors these
items were incinerated or treated as regulated medical waste in 2011 we adopted a singleuse device program
where these devices are recycled and remade through an indepth and strictly regulated process the reprocessed
items are then sold at a lower cost to healthcare providers the reprocessed equipment is subject to greater
regulations than when it was originally created ensuring the safety of patients and caregivers

in november 2014 cleveland clinic began the conversion process between vendors for our suture and
endomechanical staplers at our main campus we historically purchase around 875 powered staplers annually but
the transition provides the sustainability opportunity to reuse the handle up to 50 times this will cut down our waste
of these large handles from 876 units to almost 18 units a reduction of nearly 98



managing hazardous and regulated wastes

hazardous materials such as sterilization and water treatment chemicals pharmaceuticals cleaning products
electronic wastes laboratory chemicals and radiological films and wastes are an important part of the healthcare
delivery model proper management of these materials is critical to protecting the health of our caregivers and the
community at large as part of our chemical disposal program our pharmaceutical waste program was recently
expanded to capture all pharmaceutical waste for responsible disposal thus preventing contamination of the
environment all hazardous and regulated waste generated at cleveland clinic is treated appropriately and
disposed of domestically




waste segregation

we track the average total cost per ton to dispose of a given material type to convey the importance of proper
waste segregation regulated medical waste rmw due to the special treatment steps whether they are
performed onsite or downstream requires proper disposal making it among the most costly waste streams 
second only to hazardous waste while we take great care to make sure that all appropriate medical waste is
disposed of properly inevitably there is a significant amount of waste that ends up in biohazard bags that is not
contaminated and should not be treated as such

in 2014 matthew davis md a ken lee memorial fellow conducted a 10day blinded audit of or rmw waste
container utilization findings indicated an opportunity to improve rmw container optimization as between 5070
of supposed rmw waste was in actuality regular waste after rightsizing containers in or suites a second
blinded audit was conducted to the hypothesis that incorrect waste disposal was largely due to lack of proactivity
towards correct waste segregation these audits continued in 2015 and dr davis was able to show a 30
decrease from baseline when the program is rolled out enterprise wide it will result in significant enterprise
savings

dr davis will seek to publish his findings in a peerreviewed journal with the intent to inform on caregiver
engagement and sustainability in healthcare his findings will inform a broad internal reeducation campaign
targeting use and composition of our rmw



going green by using blue

our green team recycling sustainability motto is go green by
using blue in 2015 our enterprise comingled bluebag recycling
program diverted 2536 tons of cans bottles glass cardboard and
poster board from the landfill the office for a healthy environment
works with green teams and the environmental health  safety
department across the enterprise to right size our recycling
containers and adjust service frequencies to meet our needs

healthy buildings
our buildings support our mission by addressing the link between a persons health and their environment in this
sense our patients environment includes the air they breathe and the water they drink their behaviors including
exercise and nutrition and their values including their choice of healthcare system to date we have achieved 15
leed certified buildings  8 silver and 4 gold in 2015 we continued to grow and set new standards for out
buildings and development that support the health of our patients caregivers and communities



weston expansion

in 2015 cleveland clinic completed construction of the 92
million neurological institute and cancer institute nici at our
weston florida campus the us green building council
announced that the building earned leed silver status and is
the first leed healthcare project in the state of florida the
facility is designed to use natural light to create a positive and
healthier experience for patients and a more functional
sustainable environment for visitors and caregivers

the 143000 square foot fivestory facility includes

   an expanded neurological department and cancer center

   two linear accelerators

   advanced radiosurgery technology

   shelled vault for future expansion and

   physical therapy infusion suite




brunswick emergency department

cleveland clinic expanded our brunswick family health center which went operational in july 2014 the project
followed the leednc 2009 standard and has applied to receive certification from the us green building council
the facility earned this designation because of its environmentally responsible design and efficient operating
systems

leed leadership in energy and environmental design is a thirdparty certification program and the nationally
accepted benchmark for the design construction and operation of highperformance green buildings high
performance buildings conserve energy and water save money reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute
to a healthier environment for residents workers and the larger community

this demonstrates our continuing commitment to designing and building safe efficient buildings using the us
green building councils leed system and evidencebased design this results in healthier and safer
environments in which employees can work and patients can heal said jon utech senior director for cleveland
clinics office for a healthy environment

serving our present caring for our future                                                                           81

well building standard

case western reserve university and cleveland clinic are expanding their health education collaboration to
include dental and nursing students on the campus already planned for the institutions medical students

the worldrenowned architecture firm foster  partners designed the 485000squarefoot health education
campus hec to stand on the same 11acre parcel originally designated for the medical education building slated
for 2019 completion the hec will be located on east 93rd street between euclid and chester avenues and it will
include even more of the cuttingedge technology and innovative learning spaces previously planned for medical
education

studies show that teambased healthcare improves patients experiences and results lowers costs and increases
the job satisfaction of those involved in care case western reserve president barbara r snyder said yet most
of our education programs still separate the professions throughout students academic careers this project allows
us to bring these future healthcare leaders together from the very start and to do so in a thoughtful and intentional
way

the fourstory buildings academic spaces and offices will wrap around an airy atrium where students faculty and
staff can gather for meals and conversation all of the furniture in the space is movable so the atrium can host large
events such as lectures convocations and banquets the structure is designed to be as energy efficient and
environmentally friendly as possible at minimum the building will meet leed silver environmental building
standards local architects westlake reed leskosky also are involved with the project going beyond leed the
building is also pursuing the well building standard a new green building approach focused on how the built
environment directly impacts human health

case western reserves dental medicine and nursing programs together enroll just over 1500 students while the
medical schools md tracks total nearly 1000 the cleveland clinic lerner college of medicine track enrolls 160
of these students with the remainder in the universitys md and mdphd tracks the medical school also plans
to add a physicians assistant program that will grow to enroll 100 students all of whom also would learn on the new
campus



initiation of cancer center

in august 2014 cleveland clinic announced plans to build a new 276 million multidisciplinary cancer building that
will unite all treatment care teams on our main campus in one central facility and accelerate one of the most robust
cancer research enterprises in the country the new sevenstory facility is part of cleveland clinics master plan
which aims to build a more open and welcoming campus for patients and visitors as well as stronger collaboration
among staff

the 377000squarefoot facility has been designed to optimize patient experience and physician collaboration with
clinical space focused on multidisciplinary care and conveniently accessible expanded support services the project
will be pursuing leed certification under the 2009hc designation continuing cleveland clinics green building
tradition

the new space will accommodate projected growth with an emphasis on features specifically for patients including

   maximum use of natural light and outdoor courtyard views to comfort and calm patients receiving treatment

   an additional 19 exam rooms for a total of 126

   an additional 17 private and semiprivate chemo infusion rooms for a total of 98

state leadership

we present our programs and share our experiences at the ohio hospital
associations biannual energy cup meetings cleveland clinic also works
with ohio hospital association to benchmark hospitals and medical
buildings and offices as well as to participate in the oha energy cup
challenge to reduce annual energy usage

the oha energy cup is a competition in which over 100 ohio hospitals
and healthcare buildings race to reduce energy use and limit greenhouse
gas emissions competitors use their own initiatives to reduce energy
consumption these reductions help save costs and promote a clean
environment by reducing emissions a cleaner environment means
healthier lives for those in the local community and across ohio

in 2016 four of our hospitals were recognized for their 2015 energy achievements and medina hospital was
recognized for having the largest yearoveryear energy use index decline for a large hospital at over 14

challenges our internal goals will also be shaped by the desire to accelerate progress as we approach this
landmark date as a result our program will increasingly be engaged in civic dialogue and innovation




cleveland clinics office for a healthy environment helped shape the city of clevelands goal to reduce
greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 80 from 2010 to 2050 and helped to develop the 33 actions outlined in the
community action plan to achieve this goal



enterprise leadership

the office for a healthy environment is the keeper of best practices and driver of sustainability strategy for the
enterprise we are leaders in thought word and action as we create a sustainable future for our industry we use a

water stewardship
while clevelands location on lake erie  the 12th largest body of fresh water in the world  provides cleveland
with a distinct comparative advantage the citys reputation has also been blemished by the historic cuyahoga river
ﬁre in 1969 that resulted from excessive levels of pollution caused by heavy manufacturing and industrial
contamination

freshwater resources represent an invaluable local asset that has shaped clevelands identity both in the way that
the city has perceived itself and how it has been recognized outside the region cleveland clinic actively protects
our water supply through conservation measures and stormwater measurement as stewards of our communitys
health we see preservation of our communitys natural resources as a vital part of our health mission




2015 year of clean water

the cleveland water alliance facilitated the 2015 year of clean water working group as part of sustainable
cleveland 2019 this working group elevated the conversation around clean and abundant freshwater as a regional
asset forging collaborations among partners to collectively implement water education and outreach projects and
promoting the multitude of watershed and waterrelated organizations programs and events throughout northeast
ohio

cleveland has the responsibility to protect the 128 trillion gallons of fresh water directly off its shores in order to
maintain the citys water supply and ensure that its residents will have clean and readily available water resources
for generations to come but it also has the opportunity to leverage this invaluable asset as a driver of sustainable
economic growth and prosperity for the local economy



rain barrels




inspired by the collinwood painted rain barrel project which we hosted in glickman hall at main campus in june
2015 the cleveland clinic system green teams sponsored a rain barrel painting contest to promote water
conservancy awareness and engage facilities all of our green teams participated in the event the enterprise voted
on the best designs and the winner received 500 towards their facilitys employee hardship fund

the winner of this years rain barrel contest was hillcrest hospital titled water has many colors

avon bed tower

the expansion of cleveland clinics richard e jacobs family health center was planned with great attention and
care to the natural environment the avon ohio site contains extensive areas of wetlands forests and large
amounts of streams throughout the project planning process we coordinated directly with natural resource and
regulatory agencies including us army corps of engineers ohio environmental protection agency us fish and
wildlife service and ohio department of natural resources to ensure that the hospital expansion was in
compliance with all state and federal laws in place to protect these important resources

the permits received from the state and federal governments authorized impacts to 397 acres of wetlands and
671 feet of stream however these important resources were not lost forever as a condition of receiving the
permits cleveland clinic was required to provide replacement wetlands and streams to compensate for the impacts
resulting from the project to mitigate the loss of wetlands on the site in accordance with state and federal rules we
purchased a total of over 9 acres of wetlands from the nature conservancy and ohio wetlands foundation two
organizations that work to restore wetlands within ohio

cleveland clinic also committed to the extensive use of permeable pavers across the new parking on the property
permeable pavers are an important green infrastructure technology that helps to protect the water quality of our
streams when rain hits permeable pavers it is retained for an extended period of time within the deep gravel sub
base which also serves to filter out contaminants from the storm water before it is released permeable pavers
provide great benefits when compared to traditional asphalt or concrete pavement the use of permeable pavers at
the avon site is the largest of its kind within the greater cleveland area



water optimization

we have 28 different controllers on main campus that run the irrigation system all are equipped with rain sensors
so they do not operate when it rains but twentythree are older hunter controllers that must be manually adjusted
we have five tucor controllers that can be remotely accessed from a computer that control the mm garage 89th
street green space the crile mall the new lab building the area around the heart center and along the euclid
corridor the aillee and jj building and the crile mall east and part of cole eye institute the controllers are
designed to receive weather information such as expected rainfall wind speed and temperature so that presets can
be determined to meet each areas need for water

rainbow sprinklers and our grounds coordinator try to adjust the times and frequency of watering of each
controller on a biweekly interval we have already reduced the time of watering around campus due to the cool
weather and rainfall historically in september we shut off sections wherever we can



waterless hand scrub

led by physician champion matthew davis md our greening or committee promoted water
conservation through use of dry scrub taps off while lathering in our ors with facilities
assistance to install hidden water submeters on surgical sinks dr davis conducted a water
audit to establish a baseline practice he then educated the house staff association on the
effectiveness of a dry scrub technique citing the american journal of infection controls
publication on the effect of surgical site infections with waterless and traditional hand
scrubbing protocols on bacterial growth
