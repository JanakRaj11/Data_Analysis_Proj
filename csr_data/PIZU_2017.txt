        311 emissions

        as a company with environmental protection responsibilities the group has
        been actively finding ways to reduce greenhouse gases and other wastes
        produced during operations in terms of energy conservation the group has
        since 2014 invested more than 30 million rmb in technological
        transformation for the production line purchasing domestic topoftheline
        production equipment which have increased capacity from 4 tonshour to 8
        tonshour this has greatly increased productivity minimized production time
        and reduced consumption of boiler coal electricity and other such energy
        lighting in workspaces has all been changed to energy saving bulbs motion
        and sound sensor bulbs have also been installed in the corridors to further
        reduce energy waste

        the group has established a policy to reduce business travels to reduce
        the emission of greenhouse gases employees have been encouraged to use
        video and telephone conferencing instead of travelling and use of public
        transportation has been reinforced given the same pricing and quality
        conditions the group has given priority to purchasing from local suppliers to
        reduce emission of exhaust gases produced during transportation of goods
        during the process of goods shipping we have calculated and chosen the
        most appropriate amount of dosage to prevent overusing explosives thus
        reducing the production of hazardous gases moreover we have switched to
        more energy saving vehicles to transport blasting materials and have used
        more energy saving rigs to perform drilling to reduce the consumption of
        fossil fuels and production of tail gas

        the group places great importance on air quality in the workplace to
        improve air quality we encourage open windows for ventilation and have

        water saving faucets and water saving flushing systems to monitor water
        consumption and reduce water wastage we have also encouraged recycling
        of waste water for example using water that has been used for floor cleaning
        and other wastewater for watering office plants so as to minimize sewage
        discharge as much as possible

        the group is committed to reducing the production of solid waste in all
        aspects of operations employees are educated to protect the work
        environment through training during the process of construction production
        and in daily life we have required employees to minimize the use of plastic
        products waste and residual metal materials produced during the production
        process will be collected for other production use materials that cannot be
