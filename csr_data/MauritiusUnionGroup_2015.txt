report
introduction
this year through our 2nd report on sustainability we want to strongly
reaffirm with renewed vigour the commitment that we made in 2013 to
seamlessly integrate our business model with our value system
the report serves not only as a review and disclosure of the various
initiatives we took in 2014 but shall also act as a testimony to our vision and
commitments for 2015

                                  to achieve the goals we have set ourselves today



here
                                  without jeopardizing the resources that will allow us
                                  to keep tomorrows promises it simply means that we
                                  avoid at all costs exploiting the resources we have at
                                  hand to create shortterm value
                                  the inclusion of sustainable development principles
                                  and ethos in our business model really forces us
                                  to take a long term view of our performance and
                                  by performance we do not simply refer to our            sustainability
                                  profitability for us to be successful implies that
                                  we are able to harness our knowledge skills scale
                                  and resources to create value for all the major

the views of bertrand casteres chief executive officer

what were the highlights for the group over the past year

 last year was a challenging and exciting year for us indeed we cannot deny that it has not been plain sailing throughout with market conditions that
 have been tough to navigate in
 nonetheless last year marked one major achievement for the group which can be succinctly summarised in one single word africa indeed we
 had finalised the deal with phoenix transafrica holdings ltd which makes us the major shareholder in phoenix of east africa assurance company
 ltd peal with peal being well established in 4 different countries namely kenya uganda rwanda and tanzania we believe we have made a
 wise investment with tremendous potential africa is a land of opportunities and backed by our long years of experience in mauritius we have the
 right dose of knowledge capabilities and resources to further develop the market and the peal subsidiaries into yet another success story of the
 mauritius union group
 it is fundamental for any business who wishes to be successful these days to avoid complacency in its strategies it is something we religiously keep
 in mind to keep up with the market and its ever evolving demands we have invested considerably in further developing our digital platforms last
 year we have launched our new website with a distinct modern fresh and minimalist look and it serves as an apt display window for all the products
  services that we propose we have also reworked on the process flow and the design of our motor insurance ecommerce platform click  go


and the less positive points                        how does sustainability fit with the                  what are your key focus areas with

 predominantly the market for our main
 portfolio the motor insurance segment               since 2013 we have been working on                   our aim and vision are that in 3 years

 competition amongst insurers more intense             in our business practices and it is slowly            evaluated in terms of the resources they
 than ever the premium collections have               becoming a crucial aspect of how we see               use and the efficiency with which we make

 and consolidate our position as market                to us efficiently and judiciously after all         is for us the driving force behind the
 leader                                               having a longterm vision is verily the dna           restructuring of our operations
