message from michael roth

as a company responsible for some of the worlds most iconic marketing campaigns we
understand that ipg has a special responsibility to build our business practices in line with
social and environmental considerations and communicate our marketing messages in a way
consistent with the longterm health of our communities doing so is not only key to our
culture and the right thing to do but is in fact a mandate for our business success

as a company we define sustainability broadly and understand it to include the longterm
health of our environment as well as working to better the communities where our employees
live and work and ensuring a diverse and inclusive workforce for all of our employees

we understand that sustainability is a significant opportunity for our company as we
efficiently manage resources while driving employee innovation and profitability this past
year we have taken steps to solidify and strengthen our commitment to sustainability across
our organization importantly this marks the first year that we are moving toward gri g4
compliant sustainability reporting publishing our first sustainability report that utilizes the
gri framework in addition this year our company signed onto the un global compact  the
first usbased ad holding company to do so  and committed to the ten principles that the
compact embraces in the areas of environmental sustainability fair labor practices human
rights and anticorruption

initiated in 2010 our corporate sustainability policy outlines areas of focus where we can have
the greatest impact in terms of environmental responsibility  energy usage recycling travel
and green building practices we continue to make strides in these areas with a 31
reduction in square foot per employee during the last decade and a 66 reduction in power
consumption in our central it operations since 2008

our commitment to our communities also includes employee volunteerism broadbased pro
bono work as well as traditional cash donations and management commitment to notfor
profit leadership these initiatives include providing light from renewable energy sources to
underserved communities to providing clean water to poor communities to helping ensure
that teens stay drugfree ipgs community involvement is having a positive impact in the
places around the world where we do business and where our employees and their families
make their homes

finally the kinds of messages we develop to communicate on behalf of our clients brands in
reaching consumers are steeped in longterm thinking that reflects a commitment to the
health of the environment and global community examples include a partnership with
unilever to increase hand washing and save lives in india our antibias work with coca cola
around ramadan and our lgbt pride campaign with stoli

we understand the importance of sustainability to our stakeholders we will continue to

                                                                                                   3

strengthen and build upon our commitment to sustainability during the year ahead its the
right thing to do for our employees for our clients and for our business

note above are the estimated scope 2 numbers the actual numbers are 3134 mtco2e
2013 and 5572 mtco2e 2014here is the description from measurabl on how the
estimated numbers are compiled

first we estimate your electricity consumption by using 2 different methods 1 if youre
missing less than 6 months of data then we will fill those months using the average of your
buildings consumption 2 if youre missing more than 6 months of data then we use the well
known cbecs averages per property types once we get your estimated electricity
consumption we then calculate your scope 2 emissions average based on your buildings
epa egrid zone and use national average for any buildings outside egrid zones


2013 and 2014 uncertainty number for scope 1 is 2 and the uncertainty for 2013 scope 2 is
2670 and 1201 for 2014


the likeforlike lfl numbers are in the parentheses above heres the likeforlike
definition from measurabl

likeforlike compares the consumption for buildings with 12 months of data in 2013 and 12
months of data in 2014 therefore any buildings with partial data in 2013 or 2014 are not
included in the likeforlike values partial data can be due to 1 bought date is in 2013 or
2014 2 sold date is in 2013 or 2014 3 missing or unobtainable data for 2013 or 2014 this
normalized data gives a more accurate view of how data has changed from 2013 to 2014 by
removing any increases in data due to building acquisitions or sales

the lfl data above for electricity gives a more accurate view of how our data has changed
from 2013 to 2014 it does this by removing any buildings with incomplete data for 2013 in
our portfolio these buildings have no or partial 2013 data but at least 11 months of 2014

first we estimate your electricity consumption by using 2 different methods 1 if youre
missing less than 6 months of data then we will fill those months using the average of your
buildings consumption 2 if youre missing more than 6 months of data then we use the well
known cbecs averages per property types once we get your estimated electricity
consumption we then calculate your scope 2 emissions average based on your buildings
epa egrid zone and use national average for any buildings outside egrid zones

definition from measurabl

likeforlike compares the consumption for buildings with 12 months of data in 2013 and 12
months of data in 2014 therefore any buildings with partial data in 2013 or 2014 are not
included in the likeforlike values partial data can be due to 1 bought date is in 2013 or

reductions in energy requirements of products and services

to streamline our operations and reduce unnecessary usage of energy water and natural
resources ipg focuses on our people specifically we are focused on increasing the efficiency
of key employee processes building operations real estate occupied travel and
transportation technology use and suppliervendor purchasing sourcing

our corporate sustainability policy was launched in 2010 and encourages employees to
reduce impacts through four key behaviors

   using energy more efficiently
   instituting recycling programs where available
   managing travel more efficiently
   employing green building practices in ipg real estate holdings

over the years ipg has achieved measurable results in our sustainability initiatives that
include

   31 reduction in rentable square foot per employee from year 2004 to end of year 2014
   10 individual agencies upgraded to us leed certification standards since 2007
   usd48 million in savings due to furniture recycling from 2007 to 2014

controlling capital expenditure capex costs is an important component of interpublics
corporate sustainability policy one of the most effective ways that we approach this is by re
purposing furniture within our company portfolio before any new furniture is purchased we
look within the network of ipg agencies to see what can be reutilized from 2007 to 2014
interpublic offset the use of usd48 million worth of office furniture through repurposing and
recycling

by reutilizing furniture within the portfolio ipg avoids purchasing new materials while
reducing landfill waste as reported by the us environmental protection agency epa
discarded furniture represented over 4 of us landfill by weight in 2010 at over 10 million
tons discarded per year

information technology  to improve it operational efficiencies and reduce energy
consumption ipg has migrated its it infrastructure and applications operations to the state
oftheart scott technology center facilities located on the campus of the university of
nebraska at omaha state of nebraska

ipg consolidated its four global it data centers to this new facility which utilizes energy
efficient technology and virtualization as a result since 2008 ipg it has decreased the
number of physical servers in our production and disaster recovery facilities by 30 while
increasing its hosting services more than doubling the amount of storage ipg also achieved
a 66 reduction in it power consumption and reduced the central it data center square
footage by half when we centralized our data centers starting in 2008

ipg it continues to adopt new energy efficient technology as older servers and storage age
out and need replacement and over the years we have been able to continue to reduce the
number of server racks and power required to run ipgs enterprise infrastructure and
applications while continually adding new feature functionality

ipgs 47400 employees around the world travel more than 200 million miles each year on
airplanes in 2014 the ipg travel department developed a new way to track carbon emissions
related to that travel and a way for our business travelers to play a big part in reducing those
emissions

while we work to limit our travel where possible in a client services business some of our
travel is absolutely essential smart travel policies  traveling less where possible traveling
lighter and traveling smarter  is a shared goal that we have committed to to help ensure
that travel across our organization is as sustainable as possible we have enhanced our online
booking tool to allow business travelers to sort air travel by carbon dioxide co2 emissions as
well as by time and cost we have tracked the annual co2 emissions of ipg business travel in
the past and this new system  for the first time  gives us a viable strong lever to effect
change this new tracking system has been turned on in nearly all countries where online
booking is available

co2 emissions are one of the main contributors to global warming with aviation and work
related travel being a significant carbon emitter with this new enhancement to our online
travel booking tool our business travelers can now assess comparative co2 emissions
between ipg preferred carriers allowing us to make smarter travel choices that are also less
damaging to the environment

by understanding the impact each of us can have upon the economic environmental and
social sustainability of our communities our employees can contribute in small ways to the
ongoing health of our communities our travel program that takes carbon emissions into
consideration was one of the first of its kind to be instituted at a fortune 500 company
helping make ipg a leader for our industry in this important area of sustainability

in 2014 ipg employees around the world traveled a total of 254383694 miles with total
emissions of 52168 tco2e metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent

first we estimate your electricity consumption by using 2 different methods 1 if youre
missing less than 6 months of data then we will fill those months using the average of your
buildings consumption 2 if youre missing more than 6 months of data then we use the well
known cbecs averages per property types once we get your estimated electricity
consumption we then calculate your scope 2 emissions average based on your buildings
epa egrid zone and use national average for any buildings outside egrid zones



2013 and 2014 uncertainty number for scope 1 is 2 and the uncertainty for 2013 scope 2 is
2670 and 1201 for 2014



the likeforlike lfl numbers are in the parentheses above heres the likeforlike
definition from measurabl

likeforlike compares the consumption for buildings with 12 months of data in 2013 and 12
months of data in 2014 therefore any buildings with partial data in 2013 or 2014 are not
included in the likeforlike values partial data can be due to 1 bought date is in 2013 or
2014 2 sold date is in 2013 or 2014 3 missing or unobtainable data for 2013 or 2014 this
normalized data gives a more accurate view of how data has changed from 2013 to 2014 by
removing any increases in data due to building acquisitions or sales

2014 2918 mwh lfl same

note only two of the 11 buildings were able to supply us with information about natural gas
being utilized as a heating fuel



the lfl data above for electricity gives a more accurate view of how our data has changed
from 2013 to 2014 it does this by removing any buildings with incomplete data for 2013 in
our portfolio these buildings have no or partial 2013 data but at least 11 months of 2014
data so they were excluded from the likeforlike values

this year interpublic has embarked on the first step of the journey to calculate our ghg
emissions we began with an initial boundary for measurement including our largest offices in
north america we included all offices which are over 100000 square feet with the
exception of 1114 avenue of the americas since this office moved at the end of 2015 our
scope 1 and scope 2 calculations were completed using measurabl the online sustainability
data software which aligns its carbon accounting algorithms to the wriwbcsds ghg
protocol revised edition methodologies to calculate carbon emissions we use us epa e
grid emissions factors for buildings within the united states and nationallevel emissions
factors for buildings outside the united states

there were eleven buildings that met the criteria of our boundary definition these 11
buildings make up 41 of our north american and 23 of our worldwide portfolio square

as a client services business ipg does not transport appreciable amounts of material nor
does ipg manufacture or ship manufactured goods our primary asset is our people and as a
client services company with clients and offices located all over the world our employees do
travel frequently for business we are working to mitigate the impact of this travel in several
ways

first ipg encourages its employees to utilize alternate meeting tools when available and
when practical multiple file sharing systems are in place and are regularly utilized as are
video conferencing resources in our new corporate space in new york city several of our
conference rooms are lyncenabled which expanded our functionality from laptops and
desktops voice video  screen share to the conference room audio system and lcd
monitors so employees are now able to see video stream from those speaking on one lcd
monitor next to a monitor showing the presentation materials remote users are able to see
speakers and participants in the conference room alongside presentation materials being
shared from a laptop

while while some business travel is of course absolutely essential we are among the first
fortune 500 companies to implement a tool that allows our business travelers to take carbon
emissions into consideration when booking their travel  for more information and detail on
this initiative please see our response to g4en17

as we state on page 8 in our annual report international business risks could adversely affect
our operations we are a global business operations outside the united states represent a
significant portion of our revenues approximately 44 in 2014 these operations are exposed
to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions and
difficult political or economic conditions we also must comply with applicable us local and
other international anticorruption laws which can be complex and stringent in all
jurisdictions where we operate in developing countries or regions we may face further risks
such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency
repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these
risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those
countries

as stated in our anticorruption policy spp 309 the company will perform periodic audits of
expenditures and transactions to monitor compliance with this policy

and the policy further states to the extent any provision contained in this policy is
inconsistent with applicable law the company will apply the policy pursuant to such legal
requirements in addition ipg agencies and subsidiaries may maintain their own more strict
policies and procedures to reflect local law and regulations

ipg regularly communicates its anticorruption policies and procedures by a variety of
methods some messages are intended for a broad audience eg general announcement of
any changes in anticorruption policy and anticorruption messages which are included in the
ipg legal newsletter sent to all employees other messages are targeted to specific
audiences such as live anticorruption presentations at regional finance and legal conferences
and webcasts communications are also tailored to specific jurisdictions or in connection with
circumstances that may pose increased risks for example during the midautumn festival a
chinese holiday in which business associates traditionally exchange gifts ipg sends a
reminder to chinese employees of the companys gift policy to have maximum impact this
reminder is sent by local management in the chinese language

all employees worldwide are required to take an annual code of conduct training which
includes anticorruption matters in addition ipg legal risk and internal audit personnel
regularly conduct live inperson training sessions for key personnel in significant highrisk

political activities

personal political activities

ipg employees are all permitted to positively support our communities by participating in the
political activities that interest us however we must be careful to uphold ipgs reputation by
only participating in such activities on our own time and at our own expense we may not
allow any campaign or candidate to use interpublic funds or assets equipment or trademarks
in addition we should never use ipgs name while taking part in these activities we must
never use our position of authority to make another employee feel compelled or pressured to
participate in any way in any political event or cause or for any political purpose

corporate political activities

although personal political activity is welcome as employees we may not make political
contributions by or in the name of ipg or any of its subsidiaries political contributions
include ipg funds and anything of value including loans contributions or use of goods
facilities or services these restrictions apply not only to direct contributions made to
individual candidates political committees or political parties but also to indirect
contributions that would ultimately be used to support individual candidates political
committees or political parties such as tickets to a fundraising dinner or similar event

ipgs standard policies and procedures spps also address the issue of political
contributions specifically ipgs anticorruption policy spp 309 states

due to the inherently sensitive nature of political contributions personnel may not pay or
furnish company funds facilities or services of any kind to any candidate for public office
any political party or candidate or official thereof or any political initiative referendum or
other form of political campaign without advance written approval from the companys legal
department the foregoing restriction does not apply to ordinary lobbying activities conducted
by an agency whose regular business activities consist of such lobbying activities

nothing in this policy shall preclude political contributions by personnel from their personal
funds and for personal reasons but personnel may not use personal funds to make any
payments or contributions on behalf of or for the benefit of the company

these policies are in force for employees in all countries in which ipg operates
