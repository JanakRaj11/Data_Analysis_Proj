message from the managing director

                                    fy 201617 this report details our overall triple bottomline performance in the context of
                                    economic social and environmental sustainability sustainability has always been an integral
                                    part of ashok leylands corporate ethos and business strategy the future of ashok leyland can
                                    only be secured by our ability to deliver value to our stakeholders and the society in which we
                                    operate

                                    ashok leyland is fully committed to performance excellence across all spheres of its business
                                    activities addressing concerns such as consumption of resources pollution and more importantly
                                    giving back to the societies in which we operate the focus areas for reporting the current years
                                    performance include our business performance environmental performance customer and
                                    employee satisfaction and community service

under business performance we had initiatives like prism which were designed to address concerns of customers in a speedy and
responsive manner and spark which enabled customers get right spareparts within a reasonable time and cost

environmental concerns would mould the way businesses are run in the coming years the global risks report by world economic
forum for the year 2016 lists the issues of failure of climate change mitigation and adaption extreme weather events water
crisis energy price shock as the top ten risks in terms of impact on societies to play our part in mitigating these risks we
at ashok leyland are focused on a green approach we have initiated several measures in adding green cover across our
manufacturing plants water harvesting recycling and introducing alternative sources of energy such as solar power

we also had the unveiling of circuit series of transport buses which are indias first indigenous electric bus and the launch of
iegr intelligent exhaust gas recirculation a cost effective solution to address bsiv requirements

in community service we take pride in our csr programme called road to school which saw ashok leyland adopt nearly 108
schools in tamil nadu in supporting their infrastructural needs and ashok leyland employees volunteering in teaching at these
schools our blessing scheme ashirwaad yojana started in collaboration with the government of uttarakhand and training
partner nttf with the objective to enhance skills and employability of local communities has become a benchmark for the industry

the above initiatives not only contribute to the wellbeing of societies in which we operate but also make sound business sense
it is in this context that we have started reporting our overall sustainability by proactively disclosing the details and results of our
efforts across the three pillars of sustainability

our reporting journey started last year with an internally circulated sustainability report this is our first published sustainability
report and conforms to in accordance  core option developed by the global reporting initiative gri going forward we aim to
move towards reporting as per gri standards

ashok leyland is committed to sustainability in all facets of its business which is aligned with our brand and corporate philosophy
of aapki jeet hamari jeet in your success lies our success i would like to take this opportunity to thank all our stakeholders
for their ongoing support and look forward to ideas and suggestions for further enhancing value

  in canteen hand wash area we provided 84 conventional
  taps that dispensed water at a rate of 12 litre per minute
  for hand washing 84 kld water was consumed which
  appeared to be on the high side

  we then replaced the conventional tap with water saving
  taps that dispense water at a rate of 4 litre per minute

     we believe that elimination of waste is an effective way to
     enhance profitability we take all required efforts to eliminate
     waste generation at source and ensure that the waste generated
     from our operations is disposed off in an environmentally
     sound manner following regulatory norms


     spill management
     spillages have been identified as a potential risk in our
     operations and it is our endeavor to ensure zero spills
     in this regard we undertake several measures to avoid
     spills and during the reporting period there were no
     incidences of significant spills across our operations

observations
without affecting our assurance opinion we also provide the following observations we have evaluated the reports adherence to
the following principles on a scale of good acceptable and needs improvement

stakeholder inclusiveness
the participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to sustainability


the stakeholder engagement process is well established to identify sustainability challenges and concerns of diverse stakeholder
groups and the report brings out key concerns of diverse stakeholders the stakeholder concerns are well identified documented
and reported in our opinion the level at which the report adheres to this principle is good


materiality
the process of determining the issues that are most relevant to an organization and its stakeholders


the materiality determination process was based on inputs from key stakeholders including employees customers suppliers
governments regulatory bodies media and senior management of the company the output of process clearly brings out material
issues in internal and external context in our opinion the level at which the report adheres to this principle is good


responsiveness
the extent to which an organization responds to stakeholder issues


the report has fairly brought out key responses to the identified materiality aspects ie the report focusses its disclosures on key
material aspects at macro level and has not missed out responses to identified material aspects however the report needs to further
strengthen the disclosure of management approach especially the disclosure on evaluation of management approach dmac and
identified material aspects in supply chain the company is in the process of developing systems for reporting on supply chain in our
opinion the level at which the report adheres to this principle is acceptable


reliability
the accuracy and comparability of information presented in the report as well as the quality of underlying data management systems


the company has established manual spreadsheetbased system for capturing the sustainability performance data from primary
sources for monitoring environmental labour and social performance at the three sites visited by us during our verification we
observed some of the data inaccuracies at the sites visited by us these were found to be attributable to transcription and aggregation
errors these errors have been communicated for correction and corrected for sample sites visited in our opinion the level at which
the report adheres to this principle is acceptable


completeness
how much of all the information that has been identified as material to the organisation and its stakeholders is reported


the report has fairly attempted to disclose the general and specific standard disclosures including the disclosure on management
approach and performance indicators for identified material aspects for gri g4  in accordance  core option of reporting for the
chosen reporting boundary and the reporting of performance and data for some of the sustainability performance indicators is limited
to the reporting year in our opinion the level at which the report adheres to this principle is acceptable

neutrality
the extent to which a report provides a balanced account of an organizations performance delivered in a neutral tone


the disclosures related to sustainability issues and performances are generally reported in a neutral tone in terms of content and
presentation however the report could further bring out responses related to the challenges faced during the reporting period at
various locations of operations in terms of location specific material aspects sustainability goals and targets in objective manner in
our opinion the level at which the report adheres to this principle is acceptable


opportunities for improvement
the following is an excerpt from the observations and opportunities for improvement reported to the management of the company
and are not considered for drawing our conclusions on the report however they are generally consistent with the managements
objectives
 the report needs to explicitly bring out strategic priorities under strategy and analysis and report short medium and long term
    sustainability goals and targets for identified material aspects and disclose the same in its future reports
 reporting boundary needs to include all entities included in the organizations consolidated financial statement
 a systematic process of internal audit of data management systems may be established to further strengthen the reliability of
    reported sustainability performance
 a comprehensive supply chain risk assessment covering the value chain partners will help in evolving appropriate sustainability
    strategies to manage risks
