           vegetable dyes etc
           since 2009 an environmentally friendly industrial wastewater treatment concept
           has been implemented in the company revealing a modern closed industrial
           biological wastewater treatment plant with a laboratory where waste water
           analysis and performance monitoring is made as well as wastewater research
           highquality wastewater treatment process management and system optimization
           allows the industrial wastewater treatment eﬀectiveness to approach the best
