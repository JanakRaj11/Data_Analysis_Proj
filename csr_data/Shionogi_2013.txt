10 shionogi annual report 2013

shionogi has positioned fiscal 2013 as the first
year of the groups globalization and we will
  work over the course of this year toward
    realizing our company policy globally

    in the wake of realignment within the domestic pharmaceutical industry
    a consequence of widespread ma activityand with multinational
    drugmakers pushing deeper into the japanese market the shionogi group
    has established development and sales bases in the us europe and asia
    with a view to ensuring ongoing steady and independent growth as an
    rdoriented global pharmaceutical company as a result of these efforts
    we are now poised to move onto a higher growth trajectory


    in fiscal 2013 the group as a whole will clarify priorities when determining
    cost allocation putting the highest priority on new products launched on
    the us market as a means of growing overseas sales having identified
    fiscal 2013 as the first year of shionogis globalization we will also seek to
    plant in our domestic employees the realization that shionogi is now a
    global company requiring them to adopt a much broader mindset


    continuous global development of breakthrough new drugs is required if
    the shionogi group is to survive fierce competition overcome the crestor
    cliff that will occur between 2016 and 2017 and achieve further growth
    in the postcrestor era to that end our employees are working as one to
    realize the shionogi company policy globally in the spirit of striving con
    stantly to ensure that patients around the world have access to the best
    new drugs as soon as humanly possible




                                                                                      shionogi annual report 2013   11

       interview with the president




         question           first could you outline the initiatives being taken to globalize
             1              operations as a means of overcoming the crestor cliff and describe
                            the results seen in fiscal 2012

                            as the domestic prescription pharmaceuticals market is not expected to expand further going for
                            ward shionogi must pursue a more significant presence in the large us and european markets as
                            well as in china and other emerging economies that are expected to experience high growth more
                            so than ever before we must apply a global perspective to determining how best to utilize the
                            groups limited resources in terms of manpower goods and capital in order to maximize the value
                            of pipeline products by bringing them to market quickly it is essential to make timely decisions on
                            what products to prioritize in which markets and on whether it is best in each case to go it alone
                            or to develop the product jointly with another company or alternatively secure a licensing agree
                            ment in this sense fiscal 2012 was an important year in terms of laying the groundwork for further
                            globalization of the shionogi group




                            we revised an agreement with viiv healthcare
                 1
                            concerning antihiv drugs which we believe will
                            evolve into a key pillar of earnings
                            in october 2012 we restructured an agreement with ukbased pharmaceutical company viiv
                            healthcare partner in the joint development of antihiv drugs that we hope will become an
                                                                  important source of income for the shionogi group the revisions concern
                                                                  sales rights and management of operations under the amended agreement
                                                                  we will continue to have a say in management as a 10 shareholder in viiv
                                                                  in addition to receiving royalties at a fixed percentage of sales and dividends

                                                                  to the development and sales of proprietary global products the antihiv

question   finally please discuss initiatives planned to increase corporate value
  5        and shareholder returns over the medium and long term

           the shionogi groups basic policy for profit distribution is to maintain stable dividends for share
           holders while taking into account capital demands for future business development and profits
           earned in the relevant fiscal period


           among the companys major achievements in fiscal 2012 was the revision of our alliance with viiv
           concerning the development of antihiv drugs we believe the new scheme clarifies the future
           earnings prospects of dolutegravirwhich we expect will attain blockbuster statusand other
           franchise products we further believe that with the us launch of osphenatm for the treatment of
           vva we have succeeded in stabilizing the longerterm outlook for overseas operations in doing so
           enhancing prospects for growth because of these events as of the end of fiscal 2012 shionogi has
           increased its consolidated dividend payout ratio target from 35 to 40 to return profits to its
           shareholders based on this new dividend policy shionogi will raise the yearend cash dividend for
           fiscal 2012 by 2 per share to 22 together with the interim cash dividend we will therefore pay
           annual cash dividends of 42 per share


           the shionogi group will continue to proactively undertake business activities with an eye to
           enhancing corporate value our longerterm objective being to steadily increase the returns deliv
           ered to shareholders

                               fcpa and of course to observe laws and regulations in japan
