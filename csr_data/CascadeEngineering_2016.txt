cascade engineering is comprised of nine business

units these nine businesses are collectively known

as the cascade family of companies foc although

they represent a wide diversity of markets products

and services they all are managed with one unifying

purpose that people planet and profit are all

important to our success

our 2015 tbl report represents the second decade
of sharing our successes and challenges as they
relate to people planet and profit our goal for
creating this annual report remains unchanged as
witnessed by the following introduction taken from
our first tbl report published in 2004 our first triple
bottom line report stated that we hope to create


   a higher level of organizational accountability and
    transparency
   a balanced approach to continuous improvement
   an important learning tool  for us and for other
    mediumsized companies


our purpose remains unchanged 11 years later and
we are encouraged that organizations like b corp
conscious capitalism and richard bransons
b team to name a few have recognized and
acknowledged that a business can have a higher
purpose beyond pure financial gain and positively
impact society and our environment


we acknowledge that this is a journey without end
and we must continually strive to do more while
encouraging other businesses to do whatever they
can to make our world a better place


making an impact  a way of life

over the 42 years since cascade engineerings               now granted somewhere somehow we have a return
founding i have been intrigued with the dual               on our investment over time maybe its in the form of
opportunity any business has to be financially healthy     just being proud as we greet each other with a smile
allowing growth of the business and the opportunity         knowing that the smile is real not forced      maybe
to make a positive impact in the world with our             its in the form of people willing to work hard without
business we define our purpose as follows to make        being asked because they really care about the place
a positive impact on society and the environment and       maybe its in the form of creativity or maybe its in
to be financially successful to many organizations        unexpected benefits like friendship and trust
this may sound like a zero sum game since making
an impact can be perceived as taking away from              cascade engineering is committed to doing the right
profitability                                              thing and this is demonstrated in our being a certified
                                                            b corp not only are we committed we demonstrate
we believe something quite different we believe that       it to ourselves and the world by doing an extensive
if we treat people well design our systems and our         evaluation of our systems while putting plans together
culture to help people thrive both personally and          to get even better does performance take a back
professionally that the business will quite naturally      seat to this work absolutely not performance is
thrive as well oh it takes nurturing it takes feeding   probably enhanced      performance is enhanced by
but the results are so worthwhile as we get to tell         trust trust is enhanced by our culture and our culture
stories of employees that value their long term status      is enhanced by the degree to which we demonstrate
with cascade engineering their opportunities to take       our commitment to our values
care of their families and their opportunities to grow
and progress                                               making an impact  for us its a way of life


over the years we have institutionalized some of the
good things that make a difference in our culture by
turning them into programs which become just part
of the fabric of cascade engineering programs such
as welfare to career antiracism and returning
citizens are who we are they work to complement
each other even as they inject some tension in the
culture why do we do this why take the risk i
think of these programs as how we demonstrate being
authentic and true to our values i often get asked why                                           fred p keller
we do these sorts of things and i find myself simply                                             founder  chair

saying its the right thing to do

our tbl performance

i have always admired fred for his willingness to lead a
company that is committed to the triple bottom line tbl
listening to him talk he makes it sound easy because its
the right thing to do it means at cascade we are rooted
in values and we use those values to guide us in business


i have come to realize that what we do is not only the
right thing to do it has the added benefit of being the
smart thing to do when people work where their voices
are heard you bring a multitude of ideas innovations and
opportunities to the forefront when those voices come
from a diverse set of backgrounds they are even more
powerful


our 2015 fiscal year ended on august 31st and i am
pleased to report that our entire family of companies
foc comprised of nine diversified businesses had record
performance across each dimension of our tbl


on the people side we celebrated our best safety
performance in 25 years our employee satisfaction
survey scores were at an alltime high we also took
pride in watching returning citizens transitioning into
management positions


on the planet side we used more recycled material than any
time in the history of the company we also like knowing
our automotive dash silencers are 100 recyclable and            for improvement we will make mistakes along the way
the market is following our lead in that direction we are       but that is how we learn
maintaining multiple facilities at zero wastetolandfill and
moving others closer to that objective                          all that remains to be said is thank you to all of our
                                                                 employees suppliers and customers for your continued
on the profit side we finished with our second consecutive       support and dedication as we pursue our triple bottom
year of record revenues and profits the strength of our         line initiatives for people planet and profit
balance sheet will enable us to further increase impact


interestingly people still think about elements of the tbl
as being an eitheror proposition nothing could be
                                                                                                    mark miller
farther from the truth when balanced correctly each leg

can leverage the others in full disclosure this is easier to
say than do we are far from perfect and have much room

our dash silencers and 3d suction blow molded
components utilize recycled material content and are 100
recyclable at the end of their product lives making them
particularly appealing for our tbl purpose of environmental
responsibility not only are these products recyclable they
are designed with the intention of reducing weight and
hence fuel consumption by utilizing 100 recyclable
thermoplastic olefin tpo rather than nonrecyclable
ethylene vinyl acetate eva automotive americas will help
reduce land fill targeted waste by approximately 2500 tons
per year


a record year for car and truck sales along with reduced
oil prices allowed our cascade engineering automotive
americas ceaa group to see substantial growth and
record financial performance our injection molded dash
silencers and our 3d suction blow molded components
are both witnessing continued growth with new customers
like honda and harley davidson in addition to pursuing
our traditional automotive customers we are also supplying
new customers like harley davidson motorcycles polaris
power sports  off road and volvopenta outboard
engines


with our successes also come some challenges like
reduction of our tooling cost and build timing our global

xtreme rfid

there is great potential for radio frequency identification     xtreme rfid requires gotomarket strategies which are far
rfid particularly since it is so closely aligned with         different from the requirements of our long standing legacy
sustainability rfid tags are used to track assets for          businesses our business requires us to generate our own
theft reduction asset life cycle management inventory         leads through nontraditional efforts traditional marketing
management productivity and efficiency improvements           was not generating the leads to sustain this business so
asset visibility in the supply chain and automation of data     we launched a digital marketing campaign to drive leads

rfid technology is growing but is still in the early adoption   industry websites these efforts have increased the leads
phase of market acceptance 2015 saw the introduction of        coming to us by eight fold and are generating a higher
22 new part numbers and 18 new customers and we expect          percentage of qualified leads for us to pursue
continued growth in 2016 the rfid market is relatively new
and we are taking a broad approach to commercialization        we launched a portfolio of industry leading combination
the markets xtreme will be focusing on this year include        tags we can now manufacture all of our tags in clear resin
utilities commercial fishing manufacturing oil and gas      with bar codes and humanreadable numbers this provides

we successfully executed three key strategic initiatives        majority of our sales come from these products
in 2015 we finalized and launched our extrusion molding
process this patented process provides new key                 today we use xtreme rfid tags on every waste container
competitive advantages in the manufacture of rugged             we make for cascade cart solutions and many of our
rfid tags we can now mold very low profile rugged tags         decade bins and pallets are identified through rfid
that are a onepiece design competitive offerings are two      technology
piece which are not as rugged and have lower ingress
protection ratings we can now manufacture at a very high
rate of speed 50000 tags per day we will be moving the
production of rugged tags for cascade cart solutions from
injection molding to extrusion this will free up 250 ton
press capacity to produce additional rfid tags and other
small tonnage products for cascade engineering
