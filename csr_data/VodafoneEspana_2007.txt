    what is the situation of this matter                             legislative authorities in the abovementioned european environment
         as i see it mobile telephony and in this case vodafone     in terms of future activities introduction programmes to other stake
    has a major responsibility in the relationship and communi        holders such as those in the legal field have been initiated in addition
    cation between people in family work institutional or social     there has been participation in administration forums and events
    environments very special mention should be made of the
    possibilities of improving the integrating conditions of groups    related to mobile telephony and activities where communication and
    with special difficulties such as the elderly the disabled       information are a priority
    women who are victims of domestic violence etc through
    mobile telephony all of them have better possibilities of being
    catered for as an example of these possibilities the vodafone
    campaign with rates programmes for immigrants helping             stakeholder priorities and actions
    them to communicate with their countries of origin look very
    interesting in my opinion                                         with the information extracted from the different communication
                                                                       channels established with our stakeholders expectations are prioritised
    what is vodafone doing in this area                              using the relevant risk analysis so that the most important matters
                                                                       to be dealt with in our annual corporate responsibility programme
         i therefore believe that vodafone is adapting its business
    to all these expressions of our social life upon which it can      are identified matters which are also covered in the corporate
    have an effect so that it not only benefits its customers but     responsibility report see figure 7
    also any person or group

    what other actions could be carried out
     by vodafone spain

         as objectives to which it should pay special attention
    the following are already being worked on effectively in my
    opinion

            transparency in information on rates and their
             advertising
            restriction of minors access to adult contents
            insistence on information about supposed health
             risks from mobile telephony and its facilities
            sponsorship of activities designed to bring new
             technologies to the groups most distanced from
             them

there been any serious incident at any of our facilities
the companys rate of absenteeism1 due to workrelated sickness
has grown during the last year by almost 05 as a result vodafone
has launched different initiatives with the aim of analysing and
correcting the possible causes these initiatives were implemented
as a pilot scheme in the point of sale unit where there was a
significantly higher than average level of absenteeism the initiatives
carried out included the following
 increase in resources
 definition of new roles
 improving the places of work
 improving the replacement times with external resources
the results in this unit have been excellent reducing the value of the
absenteeism indicator by about 35 as a result of the aforementioned
actions


we will
 produce a plan derived from the new equality act setting objectives
  to meet and actions

which covers the following stages
 new suppliers are registered either on vodafones invitation or via a link
  on our web page one of the requirements of this registration stage is
  the suppliers acceptance of vodafones code of ethical purchasing
 once the suppliers have been registered if they are of interest to the
  company they are sent a selfassessment questionnaire including
  questions relating to corporate responsibility financial and
  technological issues
 the supplier must do the selfassessment and then be approved by
  the vodafone managers who are qualified for this process

my country mi país service
the vodafone spain strategy is based on offering social products
and services adapted to the needs of each customer type
according to data from the spanish national statistics institute
ine the draft census at 1 january 2007 indicates that the
number of foreigners in spain amounts to 448 million 99 of
the population and according to forecasts by this body the
number of foreigners residing in spain in 2010 could reach 57
million 126 of the population
of the 448 million foreigners currently registered 17 million
are europeans and around 64 of the foreigners resident in
spain come from three specific places latin america the maghreb
and eastern europe
over 90 of the people from these three geographical areas
have a mobile telephone and only around 30 of them have a
fix line
bearing these circumstances in mind vodafone spain was a
pioneer in offering mobile telephony services aimed specifically
at immigrants as such the my country service was launched
exclusively in spain by vodafone in 2003 and since then it has
been constantly extended as shown in table 2

of the results of the research carried out by the danish
cancer institute pointing to the absence of any relationship
between the radiofrequency emissions of mobile tele
phony and cancer having carried out the broadest study
in terms of scope and duration which has been performed
to date

this study stands out because the research spanned more than 20
years and as the basis of the analysis the evolution of the health of
over 420000 people has been exhaustively monitored
another relevant event in this area during 200607 was the high court
ruling dated 19th april 2006 which endorsed the legislation in force and
stated that the radiofrequency emissions from mobile telephone antennas
are not damaging to human health as scientific reports from the world
health organisation who the european union the spanish ministry of
health and consumer affairs the spanish cancer association aecc the
spanish council for scientific research csic the spanish consumers
and users organisation ocu and other independent bodies have indicated
over the last five years
however despite the growing number of independent reports being                                                abc newspaper friday 8 december 2006

quality will depend on each operator individually as has been
the case to date
the agreement makes provision for the possibility of extending
cooperation to the 2g infrastructure over the same area
the context of the agreement signed by vodafone spain and
orange likewise contemplates consolidation of sites consisting
of merging the 2g site pairs run by both operators into a single
infrastructure thereby
 maintaining the service quality in place prior to consolidation
  in terms of all technical parameters
 ensuring that all components of both infrastructures can be
  hooked up to a single infrastructure
 reducing the environmental impact as a result of the
  dismantling of one of the two sites
at the same time the consolidation of 2g sites is considered as
a project interlocking with the 3g access network sharing facility
since site consolidation will share 2g infrastructures in towns
with populations of under 25000 and the 3g access network
share facility will share 3g equipments in these towns
all this will mean that infrastructures where site consolidation
is implemented will be used to share the 3g access network

8 between the beginning of 200607 and the end of 200910 see
diagram 4
this means savings in co2 emissions of at least 8 and a
reduction of 35 in co2 emissions per network traffic see diagrams
5 and 6
during 200607 financial year 62315 mwh of energy were saved following
application of this energy efficiency plan this means savings of 19691
tn in co2 emissions  as noted in the asemfo report forests as a carbon
drain june 2004 this is equivalent to the amount of co2 that would be
absorbed by a 2757 ha forest in one year

mobile phones
vodafone spain is committed to developing systems to help with the
collection and proper processing of unused mobile phones handed in
by users thus since 2001 we have run an initiative for the collection
and recycling of mobile phones known as tragamóvil mobile murcher
promoted by asimelec the multisectorial association of spanish
electronics and communication companies following the introduction
of royal decree 2082005 governing the management of waste from
electrical and electronic equipment this became an integrated
management system run by major mobile phone operators and the
vast majority of manufacturers
since the launch of tragamóvil over 715 tonnes of waste have been
managed by the initiative of which over 100 tonnes were collected
at vodafone spains shops see diagram 1
as diagram 1 shows the quantities collected by vodafone spain
through the tragamóvil initiative fell significantly during the 2006
07 period this was due to vodafone spains introduction of the reusing
system which we will discuss below
mobile phones batteries and their accessories and any other
telecommunications equipment collected by the tragamóvil
initiative are sent to a processing plant for disassembly and recycling
almost 100 of these materials are reused by the industry as raw
material for other products this system also prevents damage to the
environment since it means that potentially hazardous components
and materials within the waste cannot enter our surroundings to
pollute soil surface water or aquifers
in 2006 vodafone spain also launched a new programme to collect
used mobile phones belonging to residential customers in addition
to the environmental benefits in conjunction with the tragamóvil
initiative this also presents a social advantage for developing countries
and incentives for our customers to hand in their old phones this is
vodafones reusing plan launched in cooperation with fonebak a
firm specialising in safe collection reusing and recycling of mobile
phones and accessories

this was all part of the ecoembes integrated waste management
system of which we are a member
total water consumption for 200607 was 154320 m3 all produced
by the public water supply system see diagram 7 water disposal
mainly sanitary wastewater was mostly through the public drainage
systems and in 200607 we did not sustain any significant accidental
spillages or major outflows                                                                             diagram 6
