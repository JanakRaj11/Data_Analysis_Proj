a letter from our ceo



thank you
wherever in the world you go people know citrix sometimes its because our
technology has touched so many people in their work life many other times
its because of the personal gifts our employees have selflessly given to their
communities around the worldto help others live better

from bangalore to karlsruhe to s√£o paulo and back again this year more than
35000 hours were dedicated to help families in need we brought light to villages in india food
to the hungry care to the homeless and education to children

citrix believes in a world where people can experience work and life in harmony inventing
and delivering fantastic technologies is one way as you will see in this report being a caring
corporate citizen of the world is the other way

id like to thank all our employees business partners and community members their contributions
to the citrix global day of impact and all our charitable programs fill all of us with pride we look
forward to another successful year of giving in 2013

                   i did not have experience with volunteer work before joining
                        but it is a great feeling to donate help where it is needed
               and to contribute at least even a little to make the world a
               better place for the people in need either in our neighborhoods
               or on other continents
