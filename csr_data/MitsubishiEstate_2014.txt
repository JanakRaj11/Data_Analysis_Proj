   creating a fastmoving community through
   publicprivate partnerships
   in april 2014 we started the third stage of the          projects that the government undertakes and projects

                                                                                                                           mitsubishi estate co ltd
   another in a chain this project is essentially the     better use of public spaces as with the plans to build
   premier example of publicprivate partnership ppp       open cafés along marunouchi naka dori avenue have
   in japan                                                 been in the spotlight i believe this kind of public
      urban development is roughly divided into three        private partnership must be given greater emphasis so
   types of projects projects that private companies such   that joint creation with the public sector can help to
   as mitsubishi estate can carry out independently         energize japan overall



   changing the very concept of the office
   i believe that the role of office buildings will change   greater in this sense we see this trend as a major        marunouchi by the numbers
   significantly as peoples work styles continue to         business opportunity
   change in the future offices will not so much be           tokyo will find itself more and more in the spot          number of business establishments
   places employees go to work every day but rather         light as the 2020 olympic and paralympic games                about     4000 offices
   focus more on facilitating human interaction that         approach this represents a great chance for
                                                                                                                           total sales of corporations listed on

      given this marunouchi which attracts more            innovative thinking while closely watching the               about     135 trillion yen
   people than any other area in japan must become a        changing needs of the times and solidifying                   about 10 of japans gdp

      new collaborative space created by project
      i am so grateful for the opportunity to participate in the sixth round of the rebirth tohoku food proj
      ect this project taught me that there is nothing we cant doif we pool our strengths together and
      move in the same direction we can overcome difficulties and meet our goals this is when individual
      growth happens and selfrealization occurs and it enables us to grow together
          in this project mitsubishi estate chef mikuni and the miyagi team developed canned goods these
      products combine the pacific saury sharks fin and yuzu that kesennuma is known for into a single
      product chef tachibana from brasserie au cochon bleu part of the miyagi team gave advice and we
      tried many trial products before we succeeded chef mikuni selected the miso stew from several                           hisashi ishiwata
      proposals however this was not just a conventional miso stew we used the head and tail of the pacific                 executive director
      saury as the broth for our dish so that nothing was thrown out i encountered many new things for                       ishiwata shoten co ltd
      instance the idea of using yuzu confit as an ingredient i really struggled to learn how to sear the
      surface of the pacific saury properly we had never learned to do anything like that at our factory and
      so i discussed it with the staff and figured it out through the process of trial and error i really got a
      sense of the strong feelings and thoughts chef mikuni and chef tachibana have about food and
      ingredients in the process of developing this product it was a sobering experience for me as a person
      engaged in the food industry ultimately the same profession as these master chefs
          in the regions affected by the tsunami factories have been rebuilt but sales and customers have not
      returned to previous levels in many cases demonstrating the truth of the old saying two heads are
      better than one it offered us a framework in which different industries with the same goal could
      collaborate and work together in kesennuma this initiative seems to have expanded scope in various
      senses and also extended the reach of the products so i hope that mitsubishi estate will continue to
      build and support this kind of framework for earthquake reconstruction

      with ongoing support aiming to speed reconstruction if even just by a day
      while we have implemented a variety of activities in the field of food to support reconstruction there
      remain significant differences in the extent of reconstruction depending on the region in order to
      support the fishery and marine processing industry in miyagi prefectures coastal region ishinomaki
      and kesennuma which have been particularly slow to bounce back we developed original canned
      products using local ingredients in collaboration with local companies though it was a really tough
      challenge since we had to do everything from concept to product release in only five months the
      knowledge and efforts of the many people involved led to success and we were able to complete the
      products on time we hope to continue providing support so that the damaged areas can fully recover                      hiroko mizuta
