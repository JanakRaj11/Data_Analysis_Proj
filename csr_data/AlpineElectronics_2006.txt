     as a production enterprise alpine is focusing on decreasing the impact of its products on the environment
     we are working on developing products taking into consideration the entire life cycle of each product
    including the selection of material method of transfer manufacturing process and customer use

 alpine launched a special project in 2002 to reduce lead
adversely affecting the environment and health and have since
then been working to implement leadfree solder in 2003 we
released our first leadfree cd player in the north american
