     the system for cleaning gas with mdea
     greater specific emissions of carbon dioxide were
     recorded due to a lower load factor at the plant
     the volume of water poured out has gone down thanks
     to the tasks of optimising consumption and dealing with
     leakage as well as because of the stoppages that affected
     the plant
     the total production of hazardous waste decreased as
     a result of there being less maintenance activities at the
     plant in 2012 than in 2011
     finally reference must be made to the fact that the last
     of the activities envisaged in the waste reduction plan
     signed with the chg was completed with the construction

     there was a sharp increase in the number of hours of training                      the accident rate for 2012 failed to comply with the criteria implemented by
     no less than 7066 hours being given an amount that is rather                      elcogas as part of its annual targets although there were no accidents
     significant considering the average number of people employed                      of a serious nature the number of accidents at our auxiliary companies
     a large number of these hours are accounted for by the training                     exceeded acceptable levels this has meant that the company has had to
     courses planned as a result of the construction of the new zero liquid              admit that there has been a slight temporary failure which has also served
     effluent plant where all the personnel belonging to the technical                  to strengthen our commitment to safety and to implement measures that
     area have been given a training session aimed at describing the                     will contribute to complying with the required levels with a view to this
     new process another activity that has contributed to this training                 emphasis has been placed on the safety committees of which the workers
     increase was organising workshops aimed at perfecting our skills at                 form part stressing the need to be strict to the point of perfection when
     working as a team and communication this activity belongs to a skill               complying with the safety procedures and in the use of individual protection
     developing project for personnel management and includes several                   equipment because these are the main factors that had an effect on the
