message from md  ceo
                          dear stakeholders
                          tata housing has been making continued efforts to build sustainability into everything it
                          does so that its profitable growth reduces inequality and helps rejuvenate the environment
                          we have published the 201213 sustainability report to look back on the progress we have
                          made in the triple bottom line context and share it will all our stakeholders
                          we have become one of the top real estate players in india in the residential segment and this
                          has been possible because of our adherence to sustainability principles across the value
                          chain of the organizationa creative corporate culture ethics  governance beyond
 compliance customer centricity operational excellence in green construction employee engagement treating
 suppliers as partners and shared growth with community and environment
  traditionally a business is considered to be successful if it has generated sufficient financial return from its
 investments the triple bottom line framework of reporting extends the criteria of success to economic social and
 environmental bottomline which we have adopted
 poverty is always a challenge to prosperity as a conscious corporate citizen and more so being a part of the tata
 group we understand our responsibility towards the communities within which we operate to quote our founder
 late jamsetji tata the community is not just another stakeholder in business but is in fact the very purpose of its
 existence therefore much before csr became a trend we had aligned ourselves to the triple bottomline
 framework with dedicated budget and community engagement platforms
 we are conscious that construction sector poses a major challenge to the environment and consumption of natural
 resources such as energy water raw materials and ghg emissions are issues that need serious consideration our
 sustainability integrated approach to business gives us a sense of satisfaction that we are one of the most
 environmentally conscious real estate developers in india with more than 55 million square feet of igbc registered
 green building foot print we are one of the largest green building developers in india we have been mapping our
 carbon footprint and plan to measure water footprint too in the near future our partnership with wwfindia is a
 remarkable commitment to global biodiversity conservation
 i am glad that for the first time we have brought out this sustainability report 201213 aligned with global reporting
 initiativegri g31 2011 guidelines ernst  young llp was retained by us to provide independent assurance of the
 triplebottomline performance of the company reported here and i am happy that e  ys multidisciplinary team
 has assessed and given us the required assurance
 we will continue to improve our performance across the triple bottom lines strengthening our competitive advantage
 and long term sustainability
