to our stakeholders

pges commitment to corporate                       back to the people we serve it also demands a
responsibility has never been more tightly           readiness to be held to high expectations when
interwoven with our near and longterm              it comes to doing business responsibly
prospects for success
                                                     our report this year again provides a wealth of
our customers our partners in the community         examples of many of the ways in which pge
and many of our other stakeholders are               and its 20000 employees are working to meet
grappling with unprecedented pressures               our responsibilities and realize the greatest
due to the economy more than ever they are         opportunities on behalf of our stakeholders
counting on pge not just to deliver essential
services but also to be a steady source of          we take great pride in the many accomplish
support and a provider of that most valuable         ments from the past year but we also will
of all commodities today opportunity               be the first to point out that many of our
                                                     successes are shared the result of collabora
at the same time they also understand that          tive work with partners who are as committed
beyond the need to ease immediate hardships         and passionate as we are wherever possible
the crisis of the past year is also summoning        we seek such partners because the most
us to head in new directions and build the           significant challenges we face are rarely those
foundations for a more sustainable future           that any single organization can solve alone
momentum is gathering today behind the push
for bold changes in areas ranging from energy        last year for example we continued to be
and environmental policy to healthcare reform        an active participant in the us climate
and new market oversight and corporate               action partnership this broad coalition

                                                     of which pge is a founding member
we believe our stakeholders are looking              is now helping to drive national climate

efforts are also critical to pges future as      always welcome it
more than 40 percent of our workforce will

just as critical as bringing new talent to pge
is ensuring that we are retaining and growing       as we noted last year this document continues
our existing employees this is one reason          to evolve what began years ago as a slender

but even more essential this emphasis on           to good guidance from outside stakeholders in
training also supports our most important           particular we appreciate the invaluable input

                                                    opportunities to improve in the meantime
but regrettably this progress was                  thank you for your ongoing interest in pge
overshadowed we again experienced                  and your support
the loss of life within our ranks as well
as a number of serious injuries a tragic
accident involving a natural gas home
explosion last year also served as a sad            sincerely
reminder of the potential stakes we face
when working with gas and electricity

in 2009 we are intensifying our focus on safety
again we are encouraged by the continued
                                                    peter a darbee
progress to date however our goal is zero
injuries while we will not achieve it overnight   chairman of the board ceo and president
we do believe it is achievable over time and       pge corporation
we will not be satisfied until we are there

safety is perhaps the most important example
of areas in which we know we have to seek
stronger results there are of course others
as well for example we believe we can
improve the diversity within our workforce
especially among our leadership ranks we
are also striving to elevate our performance
on basic environmental compliance within
our operations as in prior years this report
is as much an opportunity for us to openly

industrywide challenges
a   chieving our vision depends on setting clear direction adhering to our values and managing
    the business sustainably amid a multitude of everevolving realworld challenges

along the way we like every large company today inevitably encounter tough choices we
have to assess and adjust priorities we have to balance competing or conflicting stakeholder
interests we have to consider tradeoffs between immediate versus longterm objectives we
have to acknowledge and work within the practical boundaries imposed by time economics
technology government human resources or other factors

one important window into a companys corporate responsibility performance is the way it
resolves the tensions that arise as these challenges converge as a result we believe it is
valuable to provide insight into some of the most significant challenges we face by doing so
we hope to give stakeholders a clearer lens through which to understand and evaluate pges
overall performance

while this section focuses on industrywide challenges it is important to acknowledge that
we also face a number of challenges more specific to pge two of the most significant are
improving safety in our workplace and improving the reliability of our service in both areas
we made significant strides last year improving key standard performance statistics yet the
need to continue doing better is urgent

we know from benchmarking that other companies in the industry are performing significantly

sharpening our focus
on safety
at pge we recognize that employee and
public safety must be the foundation for
everything we do

we made good progress in key areas in
2008 we significantly reduced onthejob
incident rates as well as the numbers of
lost workdays and motor vehicle incidents
however significant these accomplishments
were though several tragedies cast a shadow
over the years results including the deaths
of two employees and a contractor while on
the job as well as an injury that cost one     geisha williams senior vice president of energy
employee both of his hands these events have delivery addresses employees about the importance
                                                of working safely
led us to adopt what we believe are now the
most exacting safety policies and practices in
pges history                                 a work environment with zero incidents each
                                                and every employee must take accountability
in sum even with last years strides we are   for working safely
not satisfied when we compare our perfor
mance with that of bestinclass companies     our safety and health policy forms the
as a result we continue to sharpen our focus   foundation for the programs we use to pursue
on safety to ensure that we are doing every    our goals in 2006 we began implementing a
thing we can to prevent injuries and incidents zero in on safety initiative which continues
going forward we are holding leaders at all    today it includes tools and information to
levels accountable to raise the bar on safety   help employees identify evaluate and control
and ensure that our human performance is at     hazards and safety issues and improve overall
the level it must be at to achieve our goal of safety performance

      ur vision of industry leadership includes setting an example
      as an environmental leader we recognize that producing and
      delivering energy are at the core of the broad environmental and
economic sustainability challenges that seem to become more apparent
every day equally clear is that we cannot address these challenges in
isolation they are inextricably woven together from habitat and species
protection to water conservation forest and land management energy
conservation waste minimization air quality and global warming
job number one in all of these areas will always continue to be excellence

our customer commitments but the biggest and best opportunities we
have to grow and prosper in the future are those that contribute smart

pge remains fully committed to working to
achieve this goal we will continue to pursue
every avenue to increase eligible renewable

advancing clean energy
solutions for our customers
pge is helping a growing number of
customers install solar energy systems
through the california solar initiative csi
in 2008 we interconnected more than 6500
customerowned solar power systems to the
electric grid this brought our total to more
than 27000 interconnected solar systems
more than any other utility in the country

the overall goal of csi is to create 3000 mw
of new customerinstalled solar capacity by
december 2016 moving the state toward a
cleaner energy future and helping to lower
the cost of solar installations for customers
importantly because using energy more
efficiently is the most costeffective solution
                                                      customers must first complete an energy
