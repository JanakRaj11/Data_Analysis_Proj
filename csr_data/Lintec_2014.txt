    individual business divisions and production sites could develop       sites to perform a drill so that they could identify and check various
outlines of plans however to ensure the business continuity of the        problems in a single drill we also gave instructions on the

and we did not have crosssectional rules                                 that the instructions should be more accurate and easy to

            necessary so we focused on creating materials which were easily                               and rulemaking actual drills of various levels should be conducted

                   this confusion was solved by a technique to identify and sort out                        lot from site drills with these findings the effectiveness of the system

               i participated in the fureai concert with my              daughter and her performance she played the
               daughter in fall 2013 ive never participated            hand bell and danced a sign language dance
               with my daughter in this kind of musical                  proudly in front of such a large audience it is
               event before i was little bit worried that the           very encouraging for families with disabled
               performance would not be very interesting                 children that a company takes initiative in
               for children because the band was a jazz                  providing this kind of opportunities to interact
               band but as they also played cartoon songs              with society i hope lintec will continue this
               my daughter and i could enjoy the                         activity in the future
               performance i was also very proud of my
