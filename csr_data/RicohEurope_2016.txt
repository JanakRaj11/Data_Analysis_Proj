leveraging core technologies to deliver new value in healthcare

we acquired the magnetoencephalography business of yokogawa electric corporation in april 2016 we will

the imaging technology systems design capabilities and production expertise of our core operations to help
prevent and swiftly identify and treat illnesses helping resolve social issues through such value
