that they are trying to achieve after we have discussed
the issue a number of times we start to see what their
underlying needs are at that point we like to get
everything onto one large sheet of paper on the wall so
that we can pinpoint the issue exactly with the customer
having done that we start to see where there is scope
for collaboration and we work out specific measures to
address the issue in some cases more than a year of
work may be involved but that would then turn into a
substantial business for us

              comments on the project from government and industry officials


                                                    according to the results of a national education survey
                                                  conducted by the ministry in 2012 the proportion of students
                                                  responding that they enjoyed studying science was high 82
                                                  in the sixth grade of elementary school but this fell to 62 for
                                                  students in the third year of junior high that is a drop of
                                                  about 20 over a threeyear period moreover only 53 of
                                                  students in the third year of junior high agreed that what they
                                                  learned in science classes would be useful when they left
                                                  school this means we are also seeing a drop in the proportion
                                                  of students who appreciate the significance of science
                                                    to address this situation we believe it is important to offer

                                                    what is so special about this project is the way in which
