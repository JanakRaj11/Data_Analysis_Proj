    director  general managers statement
    as this report was being written in early 2012 haesl celebrated
    15 years since the company commenced its operations in
    january 1997 haesls progress since that time when it was
    transformed from being just a division of haeco to a stand
    alone joint venture has been remarkable  however in order to
    fulfil the companys vision of being best in the world best for
    the world we have to go beyond the principles of operational
    excellence on which the company was founded and live up to
    bestinclass practices of sustainable development


    in the area of employee safety the company has made
    significant progress during 2011 through the implementation
    of the i care i report nearmiss reporting system into our
    organisation   this programme was initiated in september
    2010 and 2011 saw its first full year of operation with 625
    reports being filed throughout the year  with the large influx
    of new employees over the last year   bringing haesls
    headcount to in excess of 1000 persons for the first time
    at the end of 2011 a number that is still growing fast
    ensuring that the principles of safety in the workplace are
    embedded in the companys culture is a key focus for the
    companys management  unfortunately the number of lost
    time injuries ltis rose by one incident in 2011 compared to
    the year before to a total of nine incidents however the two
    measurements used to determine the intensity of these  the

i report reporting system by adding a focus on  i resolve  with an increase in            enthusiasm with which these activities are pursued and the generosity that our

     part this can be attributed to electricity and aviation fuel consumption an increase is observed compared to
     the previous year which is due to an expansion in business volume and an escalating workload in year 2011

     material recycling
     we consider recycling an important aspect of our sustainable development our recycling plan has been
     implemented in daily practice since 2003 recycled materials including metals paper products and printer
     cartridges are collected from our workshops and offices and sent to a recognised recycling company
     approximately 300 tonnes of paper products have been sent for recycling in total


     waste disposal management
     our daily operations generate a significant amount of solid and chemical waste by initiating a variety of waste
     management programs we strive to reduce all waste to an absolute minimum especially waste destined to
     end up in landfill sites our initiatives include promoting the use of reusable cups during tea breaks in order to
     reduce usage of disposable paper cups  source separation of waste is also implemented at all of our facilities
     to encourage employees to separate their waste for recycling

     since a growing number of reports have been filed on unsafe situations there has been a large increase
     in corrective actions to be taken during 2011 it was recognised that solving these issues would be more
     effective if the problem can be solved by the reporter himselfherself or if a suitable solution can be suggested
     by the reporterfrontline staff in the coming year the icir scheme will be escalated to a more complete
     system not only encouraging staff to report incidencesunsafe situations but also encouraging employees to
     resolving problems more proactively at source
