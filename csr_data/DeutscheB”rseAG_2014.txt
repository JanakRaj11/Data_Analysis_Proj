dear shareholders and readers

our company generated stable net revenue overall in 2013 despite the continuing difficult
macroeconomic environment around the world at the same time we expanded our ambitious
investment programme as announced in last years report as a result our profit before tax
ebit  after adjustment for oneoff factors  was down approximately 5 per cent on the
previous year we consciously accepted this effect as a necessary investment in our future
 this also highlights our firm belief in the continued success of our business model and our
 company at the same time it puts us in a better starting position than many of our competitors
 deutsche börses executive board will therefore propose an unchanged dividend of  210 per
 share to the 2014 annual general meeting for a total dividend of around   390 million this
 move continues our combination of a forwardlooking corporate strategy with shareholder
 friendly participation in the companys success



stability and new records in some of our business areas

the performance of the business areas presents a mixed picture net revenue from deutsche
börse groups derivatives exchanges declined by 3 per cent to  741 million because stock
market volatility was at a historic low and monetary policies resulted in lower demand for
hedging among market participants

in the cash market deutsche börses net revenue in the xetra segment rose by 5 per cent
to  152 million the upward trend continued at the beginning of 2014

clearstream one of the worlds largest central securities depositories and liquidity and collateral
management services provider achieved new record highs its custody volume increased in
2013 to a new record of around  12 trillion thanks to new customers among other factors
clearstreams net revenue climbed to  654 million the increase was felt in almost all of the
segments units only net interest income from banking business recorded a yearonyear
decline due to the lowinterestrate period

the new market data  services segment which had been created by merging the technology
and market data businesses saw stable net revenue at  366 million

cost and capital management remain successful

in the past years we have reduced our operating costs on an adjusted basis  in spite of steady
inflation no other major market operator has succeeded in doing so we already realised 30
per cent of the total savings under another efficiency programme which we announced in 2013
in the past year as planned another 30 per cent will follow in 2014 and we will see the full
savings of  70 million a year from 2016 onwards by implementing this programme we will
keep our organisation lean and create the flexibility needed to continue investments in growth

we are aware that this will place considerable demands on our employees not only do we
require them to keep daytoday operations running but also to face the new challenges
presented by new markets new customers and new products on behalf of the entire execu
tive board i would therefore like to thank our workforce for hence securing the companys
longterm success

however we also reduced our cost base without putting an extra burden on employees we
generated large savings in 2013 by refinancing our bonds in this way we expect to cut our
financing costs by around  45 million in the current year compared with 2012 this demon
strates that we use the capital our shareholders entrust to us carefully efficiently and with a
view to the future

this also demonstrates our commitment to a sustainabilitybased strategy we place particularly
high value on our membership of the united nations global compact and on implementing its
principles in the areas of human rights labour standards the environment and anticorruption
for us a sustainable strategy means not only committing ourselves to certain ethical values
but also to creating economic value for our shareholders for this reason integrated reporting is
important to us  both as regards our own company and for the companies that are listed on
our exchanges in our issuer guide we have compiled transparency standards for sustainable
business activities while another guide provides marketdriven recommendations for compre
hensive capital market communications



diversification strategy and new products for the financial markets

the fact that we held our ground in 2013 despite the adverse environment shows that our
strategy of diversifying into new products services asset classes and markets is working
we continue to be ranked among the worlds top exchange organisations following another
increase in our market capitalisation  by 30 per cent last year our strategy which is designed
to take advantage of structural growth opportunities focuses on clearing otc derivatives
collateral and liquidity management and further expansion in asia

eurex clearing has developed a central counterparty for clearing otc derivatives transactions to
allow market participants to prepare for the new regulatory requirements at eu level and meet
them without any problems when they enter into effect by the end of 2013 over 30 clearing
participants and more than 120 institutional investors had registered for the offering  clearly a
resounding success

because of the new regulatory requirements we also anticipate a lasting increase in demand
for collateral and liquidity management services in line with this we are systematically expand
ing our global liquidity hub which allows us to productively mobilise our provision of deposited
collateral in the medium to long term we expect this initiative to deliver significant additional
net revenue together with the australian exchange organisation and the central securities deposi
tories in brazil spain and south africa clearstream has established the liquidity alliance 
a grouping for strategic collaboration in the field of collateral management



focus of growth strategy on asia

in addition to growth in otc and unsecured markets we will continue to focus on expanding
our business in growth regions with particular emphasis on asia we clearly enjoy an excellent
reputation in asia and have been able to expand our links very significantly since we launched
our asia initiative last year

following in the footsteps of the successful cooperation with the korea exchange krx eurex
entered into a cooperation agreement with taifex the taiwan futures exchange the relevant
link is expected to go live in may 2014 at the beginning of the year we announced that we
would strengthen this alliance by acquiring a 5 per cent interest in taifex

clearstream has also signed a letter of intent with the singapore exchange sgx to jointly
develop a collateral management solution that can be extended to other markets in the region
singapore will also be the focus of our continuing activities in asia in consultation with the
local supervisory authorities and its global customers deutsche börse is currently setting up a
new clearing house there which we expect to have significant strategic potential our objective
is to provide clientoriented products and a robust infrastructure for the entire asian time zone
from this base in the long term and hence to contribute to the systemic stability of the regions
capital markets we have identified singapore as a suitable location to achieve this because
it is strategically placed and offers cultural links to both south and east asia it also has a
stable political and legal framework and a welldeveloped capital market culture that is open to
international investors

at the end of 2013 we entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with bank of china
which has very strong customer relationships across the globe together we will drive the
development of the offshore renminbi market among other projects

at the beginning of last year we amalgamated the information technology it and market
data  analytics areas and selected external it services in a separate segment this combination
is also starting to bear fruit market participants benefit from better performance and optimised
functionality without having to compromise on system stability moreover we joined forces
with the bombay stock exchange bse to adapt our new derivatives trading system to the
local market where it was rolled out in november



outlook

on this basis our overall aim is to take deutsche börse groups business model to the next
level  without losing sight of our traditional strengths by doing so we are broadening the
horizon and increasing the potential of our business we are becoming an integrated global
provider of risk liquidity and collateral management services in all key asset classes financial
products and services

this puts us in an excellent position for the year 2014 and beyond thanks to our future
oriented strategy we are a critical step ahead of our competitors  although this does not make
us completely unassailable and on balance the reregulation of the capital markets presents
an opportunity rather than a threat to exchange organisations this distinguishes us from large
parts of the financial sector our growth initiatives are becoming more and more established
as the reregulation measures are implemented across the eu

on this basis we are able to issue a positive forecast for the longer term too  until 2017 to
be precise above all the structural factors mentioned above make us confident we are expect
ing to grow our net revenue in the next four years from the current  19 billion to somewhere
in the range between  23 billion to  27 billion depending on economic developments in our
market environment this corresponds to an increase of 20 to 40 per cent unless our political
environment suddenly deteriorates we could ensure in this way that europe takes a position in
the international competitive arena that allows it to exert a globally relevant influence especially
in the area of regulation

we are delighted to have your support on this journey and want to thank you for your trust
we will do everything in our power to ensure the systematic sustainable development of our
shared enterprise deutsche börse ag

                     equity markets continue their positive performance in 2013

                     during 2013 equity markets in europe and the us continued their positive trend of
                     the previous year reaching new highs in some cases for example the bluechip
                     dax  index ended the year at 9552 points a yearonyear increase of 25 per cent
                     one of the main factors driving this development is the continued expansionary

                     other asset classes towards the end of 2013 economic data from the us

                     did not rise to the same extent as market index levels another reason is that in
                     2013 stock market volatility an important factor for sharebased derivatives

increasing efficiency

the new financial world order not only forces its participants
to comply with new rules it also opens up new horizons
for them the new financial rules are intended to boost
transparency security and responsibility in overthecounter
 derivatives trading these increase the pressure on leading
 participants to act carefully while also improving participants
 capital efficiency by leading to a reduction in individual risk


in overthecounter trading individual misconduct combined with overly complex
and nontransparent structures have destroyed confidence in efficient fair mar
kets it will take much time and effort to rebuild this confidence otc trading in
customised interest rate and equity derivatives previously took place  as the
name suggests  outside regulated markets in order to nevertheless ensure
security and efficient risk management for trading participants eurex clearing
together with eurexotc clear developed new secure and at the same time
efficient solutions over the past year for collateralised clearing of such trades 
in anticipation of the forthcoming implementation of the european market
infrastructure regulation emir

be it emir its us counterpart the doddfrank act the globally applicable
basel iii capital requirements the revised legislative framework for the european
financial markets or mifid  the new financial order will fundamentally change
the market structures for derivatives trading and clearing

exchange organisations play a central role in creating a safe space for market
participants which facilitates free trading in a secure environment trading and
clearing architectures such as t7 and c7  increase performance security and
efficiency by offering supervised exchange trading exchange organisations also
promote quality and trust among both investors and the real economy  and
hence the wealth of nations

anchoring sustainability

a financial centre on the one hand good corporate citizen
ship on the other  a conflict not at deutsche börse which
is campaigning to promote sustainable business activities
in september 2013 it presented a guide in frankfurt
containing seven recommendations for integrated capital
 market communications

nonfinancial factors  ecological and social ones as well as aspects of corporate
governance  represent an increasingly important part of the corporate value
the guide gives companies support for devising effective and informative reports
 which not only contain the usual financial figures but also details on corporate
 activities in the socalled areas of environment society and corporate governance

the core objective of the recommendations is to make listed companies aware
that materiality and conciseness are critical for effective capital market communi
cations the focus is on providing investors and analysts with the information
relevant to them information can be classified as material if they influence or can
influence the companys ability to generate and maintain value

the guide is also based on the principle of voluntary adoption rather than on
new bureaucratic regulations it builds on national and international standards of
sustainability reporting without aiming at replacing them a benefit to companies
is that selfcommitment to integrated reporting strengthens investors confidence
and hence can also promote their longterm financial participation

deutsche börse itself has had a wide range of sustainability indices for many
years which investors can use as a basis to select suitable securities for a
sustainable or environmentally friendly investment

furthermore deutsche börse acts proactively as a major shareholder of phineo
gag the independent berlin analysis and consulting institute helps potential
donors select projects worthy of sponsorship it provides transparency and
efficiency in the nonprofit sector  and therefore it shares central tasks with
deutsche börse group which is an international marketplace operator

heterogeneous architecture that soars towards the sky appear
ing both western and asian at the same time west and east
meet in singapore building on its history as a trading link
between europe and asia the city state on the equator has
established an identity as a financial centre that is anchored
not only in its independent constitutional form of government
but also in its technical infrastructure


now clearstream and the singapore exchange sgx are drawing on this identity
with a joint solution for collateral management in future the goal is to permit
customers to profit from singapores strong legal and market infrastructure and
from clearstreams expertise in collateral m   anagement assets deposited with
sgxs central securities depository can in future be used as collateral based on
clearstream technology the advantage is that the collateral remains in singapore
and is therefore subject to the laws applicable there at the same time the
global liquidity hub enables sgx to access c      learstreams proven posttrading
                                             anagement
offering in the field of risk and liquidity m

this means that sgx and clearstream have adapted in good time to the new
financial market environment  with potential not just in singapore but for the
entire region as well the new joint solutions offering will therefore reinforce
singapores position as a leading financial centre in the region and in the world

the global liquidity hubs potential is not restricted to singapore or south east
asia the offering is already being used by the brazilian central securities
depository cetip by strate in south africa by iberclear in spain and by asx
the australian stock exchange the canadian central securities depository
cds could also benefit from the advantages of the global liquidity hub in
future the joint objective of these initiatives is to ensure that financial market
participants have room to manoeuvre without endangering the value of the
collateral which has again become central in the new market environment

ensuring transparency

poor vision and unclear information do not just trouble barge
crew  investors dont like fishing in muddy waters either the
demand for transparency on the financial markets  and hence
for wellfounded information and analyses  is constantly
increasing deutsche börse group supplies independent infor
mation  in the form of indices or market data for example 
and so makes a valuable contribution to greater transparency


equity indices are key indicators that aggregate changes in individual stocks into
an overall picture of the market they reflect changes in selected share prices
documenting economic trends in markets and sectors investors use indices
as sentiment indicators and as a basis for investment decisions for this reason
they must be compiled and calculated in line with objective rulebased and
transparent criteria

deutsche börse provides the stoxx  index family via stoxx ltd the result
of a cooperative venture with the swiss six group ag stoxx indices are subject
to strict rules and comply with the principle of greatest possible transparency
in addition deutsche börses stoxx  global esg leaders indices facilitate
investment decisions that are also guided by noneconomic ecological and
social criteria

established as a paneuropean index provider today stoxx operates globally
for example the stoxx china total market index family was launched in 2012
as a new benchmark for chinese equities additionally stoxx exclusively
markets the dax  indices

deutsche börse group also promotes transparency by providing highquality
market data its key advantages compared to other financial institutions are
its independence and neutrality since it organises markets but is not involved
 in them itself it is not open to conflicts of interest  rather it has a business
  interest in creating and distributing objective data

hong kong

facilitating growth

the view over the bay of hong kong is not just aesthetically
pleasing  it also appeals to the mercantile spirit this is why
deutsche börse expanded its presence there in 2013 with
a cooperation between its posttrading subsidiary clearstream
and the hong kong monetary authority in the area of cross
border collateral management services

deutsche börse groups activities in hong kong go back much further though
clearstream has been represented in hong kong since 1991 from where it serves
customers in neighbouring markets for over two years now clearstream has also
worked together with standard chartered bank and bank of china which act as
the cash correspondent banks for hong kong dollars and chinese renminbi

deutsche börse is also expanding its trading network far beyond europe g iving
customers in asia access to one of the most liquid transparent and stable systems
in the new market infrastructure electronic bridges are being built between hong
kong as the gateway to east asia and frankfurt as the gateway to europe eurex
started operating such an access point back in 2011 at present four partici
pants domiciled in hong kong are connected to the eurex system

hong kong is not the only base from which deutsche börse supports its custom
ers in asia however singapore is at least equally as important see page 7
in addition partnerships exist with derivatives exchanges in east asia eurex is
set to begin cooperating with taifex the taiwanese derivatives exchange from
15 may 2014  another measure that both companies agreed in 2013 the
partnership is based on the very successful cooperation dating back to 2010
with the korean stock exchange krx for trading derivatives on the kospi index

new york

securing stability

manhattan the big apple in the centre of new york city and
one of the centres of the global financial industry it is bridges 
feats of american engineering  that connect manhattan with
the rest of new york the rest of the usa and the rest of the
world deutsche börse has constructed a bridge here too with
the prototype for t7  the new global trading architecture 
a product of german engineering which was first used by the
subsidiary international securities exchange t7 has been used
here since 2012 to secure the stability that us c ustomers seek


t7 is part of deutsche börse groups 7 market technology family it comprises
the trading architecture t7 the clearing infrastructure c7  and the global net
work n7 7 market technology was developed in direct collaboration with cus
tomers all eurex participants have been able to profit from this trading system
since 2013  and soon customers of the european energy exchange can too

not only is t7 powerful and fast but it also offers customers new and improved
functionality such as userdefined strategies the databases that t7 accesses
are even more reliable and the greater flexibility of the system makes it easier to
introduce new products reliability and flexibility are the cornerstones of t7 and
of the future of a secure and efficient marketplace not only for individual partici
pants but for the financial system as a whole

t7 is part of a long tradition ever since it was formed deutsche börse  with
eurex leading the way as one of the first electronic derivatives exchanges 
has developed forwardlooking products and has trialled new technologies
and anticipated market changes earlier than its competitors this is also true
of posttrading where clearstream can build on the expertise gained from
developing and operating systems such as cascade in order to now support
the european central banks initiative to harmonise european securities
settlement systems  target2securities  as a globally integrated private
 company which is also bound to act for the common good

brighter prospects

the current situation on the capital markets seems paradoxical
at first a constant stream of new demands on the one hand
is coupled with a resurgence of traditional values on the other

values to be protected  the bedrock of a functioning and
efficient financial economy in line with this deutsche börses
business is a productive mix of continuity and change tradi
tional strengths and openness to new ideas

available internationally  help customers reshape their busi
nesses to comply with the new regulatory framework reliably
securely and as costeffectively as possible in this way

                     strategic perspectives

                     deutsche börse group is expanding the horizon of the exchange
                     business it has evolved from a traditional nationally based
                     regulated stock marketplace into an international exchange
                     organisation offering derivatives trading and integrated clearing
                     with its own it infrastructure and market data distribution
                     now the transition to becoming a risk management collateral
                     and liquidity service provider  with a global footprint  is
                     within reach


                     although the financial crisis is still not entirely over structural reforms designed
                     to increase systemic stability on the financial markets are on the way for capital
                     market participants this means greater security and confidence in regulated
                     marketplaces on the one hand but also a greater cost and effort to meet the new
                     requirements on the other deutsche börse group is working on solutions for
                     keeping this burden to a minimum for its customers without endangering the
                     political goal of higher security and greater transparency on the markets that is
                     being realised gradually at a regulatory level in this respect deutsche börse group
                     sees itself as the link between market participants and regulators ultimately
                     however this new world remains focused on investor protection based on equitable
                     access to market information fair pricing and a system that functions efficiently
                     and effectively

                     new services for uncollateralised and unregulated markets

                     this means that exchange organisations like deutsche börse must master two
                     challenges as intermediaries they are responsible for minimising systemic risks
                     in the international world of finance the performance and reliability of trading
                     and posttrade systems are in turn critical for the participants in our regulated
                     markets in terms of their own risk management

                     in order to meet these requirements deutsche börse engages continuously with its
                     customers as an exchange organisation it carries a special responsibility here 
                     especially in light of the continued high volume of overthecounter derivatives otc
                     trading worldwide the bank for international settlements bis in basel estimates
                     that outstanding positions in this largely unregulated and uncollateralised area
                     of trading  as of mid2013  totals nearly us700 trillion this is an increase of

                    risk management for the financial sector

                    deutsche börse groups integrated trading clearing and posttrade offerings
                    help to stabilise the banks thereby the group underscores its ability to make
                    a significant contribution to risk management in the financial sector deutsche
                    börse group supports global financial institutions in obtaining a realtime
                    overview of their securities holdings that can be mobilised as collateral via the
                    global liquidity hub of clearstream its posttrade services provider

                    this is how clearstream helps allocate collateral optimally to secure global trading
                    positions it enables customers to efficiently meet the new regulatory requirements
                    for collateralising capital market transactions partnerships with infrastructure
                    providers in europe america and asia allow clearstream to provide this service
                    across all time zones this also reduces banks cost of equity

                    companies in the real economy increasingly need liquidity management to
                    conserve their equity and mitigate financial risk this is why clearstream is also
                    developing new solutions that optimise money market transactions between
                    banks and companies and that create additional collateralised alternatives to

            ment commission german corporate governance code published by the federal ministry of justice
            in the official section of the federal gazette have been and are being met or if not which recommen
            dations have not been or are not being applied and why not

            for the period since the last declaration of conformity dated 10 december 2012 until 9 june 2013
            the declaration set out below refers to the version of the code as of 15 may 2012 since 10 june 2013
            the declaration refers to its current version as of 13 may 2013 published in the federal gazette on
            10 june 2013

            the executive board and the supervisory board of deutsche börse ag declare that the recommenda
            tions of the government commission german corporate governance code have been and will be
            met with few deviations for the details please see below

            1 deductible in the do policy for the supervisory board no 38 3 of the code
            on the yearly renewal of the do policy deutsche börse ag will agree on a deductible in the do
            policy for the supervisory board and comply with the recommendation in no 38 3 of the code
            thereafter

            so far deutsche börse ag had not followed the recommendation to agree on a deductible in the do
            policy for the supervisory board there was some concern that agreeing a deductible could impede the
            companys ability to staff its boards with international members as agreeing on a deductible is not
            always common practice in other countries after a thorough analysis of the pros and cons of agreeing
            a deductible the company decided to agree on it in the future

severance payment caps agreed upon in all current contracts with the members of the executive board
complied and will continue to comply with the recommendation no 423 4 of the code as in the

              see the report on opportunities

            whether deutsche börse group achieves its organic growth targets will depend on the following factors
            among others

             how the financial markets perform in line with general economic conditions greater volatility in the
              cash market typically leads to more trading for example
             regulatory requirements if regulatory initiatives eg emir capital requirements directives strengthen

              the role of exchanges this will also benefit deutsche börse group
             structural changes in the financial markets trading activity increases for example if investment funds

            affect the volume drivers of these markets however the group is able to exert an influence on the other
            factors to some extent or in full for example it can lobby for a favourable legal framework for the finan
            cial markets or it can develop products and services that support customers in their business in this
            way it can also reduce its dependence on factors outside its control

            management approach to enterprisewide sustainability commitment
            deutsche börse groups goals and strategies also include taking a holistic view of its corporate responsi
            bility in line with this its management approach comprises four areas for action  the economy em

selected initiatives and specific measures from these four areas are described in the                       employees
corporate responsibility and sustainability sections

corporate responsibility falls under the remit of the ceo the corporate responsibility team coordinates

for action and implementation measures are still relevant and how the objectives can be met and the
targets reached

ecological aspects into account when implementing its economic objectives the company gave strong
expression to this commitment by signing up to the united nations global compact

and legal certainty on the markets it organises and hence to ensure fair trading in addition it aims to
ensure that sustainability information is more transparent and easily available for market participants
as a listed company it has a duty to consistently monitor and raise its own sustainability profile in line
with this dual role deutsche börse groups sustainability management focuses on two areas for action

formance examples of initiatives and their successful implementation can be found in the sustain
ability section

operating income less volumerelated costs sales revenue from external customers is generally depend
ent on the growth factors described above performance of the financial markets regulatory and struc
tural changes and the groups ability to innovate net interest income from banking business is de
pendent on the development of clearstreams international settlement business on the one hand and
the development of shortterm interest rates particularly in the euro zone and the usa on the other

            and the cost of retirement benefits they are subject to inflation adjustments and depend partially on

            payments for the stock bonus plan for members of the executive board and senior executives that was
            introduced in 2007 the depreciation amortisation and impairment charges include depreciation and

            ly a decline in business volumes has a direct impact on the groups profitability approximately 20 per
            cent of the groups costs are volumerelated costs

            intangible assets liquidity planning aims at providing liquidity corresponding to the operating costs
            for one quarter this liquidity target currently ranges between 150 million and 250 million the
            groups management of its equity less intangible assets does not aim to reach a particular target but
            rather to maintain a positive value in general

            internal control system
            deutsche börse has established a groupwide internal control system ics all business units serve as
            first lines of defense and are responsible that groupwide requirements are met in their respective areas
            of responsibility in particular the ics is valid for the financial accounting and controlling fac de
            partment ensuring that its accounting processes comply with orderly bookkeeping and accounting prac

                                                                       fundamental information about the group




the fac department is primarily responsible for preparing the accounts at deutsche börse ag and its
consolidated german subsidiaries in foreign subsidiaries this task is performed by the corresponding
units the head of the fac department is responsible for the process including effective safeguards
and controls the aim is to ensure that risks in the accounting process are identified early on so that re
medial action can be taken in good time some ics controls are integrated into the process while others
are performed independently

fac uses the following tools to ensure a consistent and continuous accounting process

 a database stores all work instructions and descriptions for the individual accounting processes
  including the preparation of consolidated financial statements
 ifrs and german gaap hgb accounting manuals and account allocation guidelines ensure a


  consistent standard of financial reporting throughout the group

these tools are regularly tested and updated all fac department employees have access to the data
base as well as the accounting manuals and account allocation guidelines and can thus get information
on the management judgement and accounting options exercised by deutsche börse group highrisk
processes are subject to special controls

in addition deutsche börse group continuously monitors and analyses changes in the accounting envi
ronment and adjusts its process accordingly this applies in particular to the national and international
accounting standards the groups accounting function is also responsible for transactions such as the
acquisition or sale of companies or shares the fac department may be contacted by all subsidiaries
if they need help with accounting for these and other complex matters for selected issues such as the
measurement of pension obligations fac consults external experts

another important feature of the ics is the principle of functional separation tasks and responsibilities
are clearly defined and allocated within the organisation incompatible tasks such as modifying master
data and issuing payment instructions are strictly segregated at a functional level an independent con
trol unit grants accounting system access rights to each employee and monitors them continuously using
an incompatibility matrix transactions are initially recorded in the general ledger or corresponding sub
ledgers based on the chart of accounts and the account allocation guidelines closing entries are made
and the consolidated financial statements are prepared in all cases in line with the principle of dual control

all major subsidiaries of deutsche börse group maintain and consolidate their general ledgers in the
same system the accounting data of the other companies is uploaded for inclusion in the consolidated
financial statements liabilities expenses and income for individual transactions are recorded in sepa
rate accounts under the name of the counterparty concerned any consolidation differences are reviewed
centrally and sent on to the accounting departments of the companies for clarification

the processes systems and controls described above aim to provide reasonable assurance that the
accounting system complies with the applicable principles and laws serving as further lines of defense
the compliance and internal auditing functions carry out riskbased independent checks to test whether
the ics is appropriate and effective the executive board and the audit committee established by the
supervisory board receive regular reports on the effectiveness of the ics for the financial reporting
process

             following a 16 per cent increase in real gdp in the oecd countries in 2012 current estimates reveal a
             rise of just 12 per cent in 2013 estimates published by the international monetary fund imf suggest
             that the global economy grew by 30 per cent in 2013 2012 increase in real terms of 31 per cent

             based on initial estimates growth in german gross domestic product rose more slowly in 2013 than
             in previous years due to slower global economic growth and the stagnation of world trade at prioryear
             levels imfs january 2014 estimates put growth in german economic output at 05 per cent in 2013
             2012 increase in real terms of 09 per cent

             as in the preceding two years economic performance in the year under review was mixed across europe
             it was stable in france austria and belgium while according to european commission estimates greece
             italy spain and portugal among other countries continued to be in recession with the strained eco
             nomic situation continuing the european central bank ecb cut its key interest rate in two steps from
             075 per cent to the historically low level of 025 per cent

             the oecd is forecasting a realterm increase in us economic output of 17 per cent in 2013  despite
             the continuing budget consolidation and the government shutdown market uncertainty is continuing
             due to the financial policy difficulties the persistently high unemployment rate and resulting lower levels
             of consumer spending the federal reserve kept the federal funds rate within the target range of zero to
             025 per cent that it had set in december 2008 despite indications in the interim that an interest rate
             hike was being planned

             the high levels of government debt in individual european states resulting in slower growth compared
             with other economies such as the united states or the uk are continuing to fuel uncertainty on the
             financial markets these factors led to a lower level of trading in the cash and derivatives markets in
             financial year 2013 affecting especially equity index products in the derivatives business

             business development

             like its predecessors 2013 was not an easy year for the players on the financial markets in europe
             and north america as well as for the organisers of these markets  the exchanges five years after the
             financial crisis investor confidence in the capital markets has still not been fully restored several factors
             had a significant impact on business development at the group

                the continuing uncertainty about future global economic developments  especially in the euro zone 
                 put a damper on the trading activities of market participants in times of acute crisis banks value the
                 reliability of exchanges as trading places that guarantee security and integrity if however the uncer
                 tainty persists beyond the short term as is currently the case this has a paralysing effect on the mar

                                                                                    report on economic position




  ket participants in addition the lack of confidence in the stable longterm development of the euro
  zone prompted investors to withdraw capital from europe and either invest it back in their respective
  home markets for example in the usa or in growth markets such as asia or south america
 a lack of clarity surrounding the legal requirements resulting from increasing regulation of the financial


  markets has led to caution among some market participants for example stricter capital requirements
  are prompting banks and other market participants to scale back their trading activities on the other
  hand this gives deutsche börse group an opportunity to score points with its liquidity management
  services which allow banks to deploy their capital as efficiently as possible
 the low interest rate policy pursued by central banks in response to the state of the economy led to


  another reduction in net interest income from banking business generated in the clearstream segment
  on the other hand interest rate derivatives trading on eurex benefited from greater interest rate volatili
  ty especially at the beginning of the year when longterm yields on german government bonds rose
  suddenly other factors included the ecbs liquidity programmes such as the longterm refinancing
  operations initiated in december 2011 and february 2012 these operations are designed to provide
  longterm liquidity to the capital markets on favourable terms this led to a deterioration in the market
  environment for the liquidity management services offered to market participants by the clearstream
  segment

despite this challenging market environment the revenue generated by deutsche börse group in finan
cial year 2013 was almost stable net revenue decreased by 1 per cent to 19123 million in 2013
2012 19323 million driven primarily by the decline in net interest income

deutsche börse ag again increased its investments in strategic projects to implement the three strategic
directions communicated in 2012 see the       goals and strategy of deutsche börse group section
therefore in the year under review operating costs adjusted for nonrecurring costs increased by 5 per
cent yearonyear to 9676 million 2012 9224 million

changes in segment reporting
the new market data  services mds reporting segment comprises the former market data  ana
lytics segment as well as selected services that were reported previously in the eurex xetra and clear
stream segments these include among others trading participant connectivity it services for external
customers and cooperation with partner exchanges that use it systems provided by deutsche börse
group the net revenue generated by eurex bonds is no longer attributed to eurex but to the xetra seg
ment

moreover since 1 january 2013 the groups net revenue item includes not only revenue generated
with external customers but also intragroup revenue such as fees for dax licences that the eurex seg
ment provides to the mds segment the mds segment reports these fees as revenue while the eu
rex segment recognises them as volumerelated costs at group level there is no effect on consolidated
net revenue the effects resulting from this change are reflected in the respective segment chapters
the prioryear figures have been adjusted accordingly in the 2013 segment reporting

             results of operations

             deutsche börse groups net revenue declined slightly by 1 per cent in financial year 2013 to 19123 mil
             lion 2012 19323 million net revenue is composed of sales revenue plus net interest income from
             banking business and other operating income less volumerelated costs the year under review was
             dominated by continuing weak interest levels and low market volatility furthermore uncertainty persists
             about the reform projects in the financial industry and their farreaching impact on market participants
             the central banks low interest rate policy again weighed on net interest income from banking business 
             a key contributing factor to the slight decline in net revenue the combined effect of the various factors
             was a reduction in derivatives trading volumes especially in european derivatives trading whereas the
             cash market stabilised at the previous years level thanks to its posttrade services deutsche börse
             achieved solid growth in the key business areas and also generated higher revenue in some product
             groups in the technology and market data business

             in the derivatives market the contract volumes for european futures and options were down 7 per cent
             while the volume of us options traded on the international securities exchange ise was up slightly
             1 per cent the decline in total contract volumes on the groups derivatives markets resulted in a
             3 per cent drop in net revenue in the eurex segment

             the cash market trading volume on xetra contracted slightly by 1 per cent while the segments net
             revenue rose by 5 per cent the reasons for these opposing trends are firstly the consolidation of börse
             frankfurt zertifikate ag since 1 july 2013 and secondly the yearonyear rise in index levels these
             had a positive effect on the revenue generated because of the pricing model which is based on the
             transaction value

the posttrade services provided by the clearstream segment expanded in the year under review clear
stream recorded both increased business volumes and higher net revenue in its three main business ar
eas  custody settlement and global securities financing this more than offset the decline in net interest
income from banking business which fell by 31 per cent in the year under review due to persistently
low interest rates even though average customer cash deposits rose at clearstream in total net revenue
in the clearstream segment increased by 1 per cent yearonyear

of 452 million

 in 2012 the executive board had resolved to increase investments in growth projects and infra
  structure in the year under review to support the groups strategic objectives the money was used in
  particular for eurexs and clearstreams growth initiatives in the area of risk and collateral management

  ment of additional employees in growth areas 2 increased depreciation and amortisation expenses on

             increase is largely due to the higher average number of people employed in the year under review and was
             partially offset by a drop in variable remuneration compared with the previous year further details of the
             sharebased payment arrangements are provided in note 39 to the consolidated financial statements

             depreciation amortisation and impairment losses increased by 13 per cent to 1188 million in the
             year under review 2012 1050 million this was primarily driven by higher investments in intangible
             assets and property plant and equipment in connection with the groups growth initiatives and infra
             structure measures

             other operating expenses relate primarily to the costs of enhancing and operating deutsche börse
             groups technological infrastructure including for example costs for it services providers and data pro
             cessing in addition other operating expenses include the cost of the office infrastructure at all the
             groups locations as well as travel expenses most of which are incurred in connection with sales activi
             ties because of the groups business model and the fact that the company does not normally distribute
             its products and services to end customers advertising and marketing costs only account for a very
             small portion of the companys operating expenses other operating expenses rose to 5880 million in
             the year under review 2012 4394 million driven primarily by clearstreams settlement with ofac

             the result from deutsche börse groups equity investments amounted to 93 million 2012 43 mil
             lion it was generated primarily by european energy exchange ag direct edge holdings llc and
             scoach holding sa however the latter only contributed to the result from equity investments in the first
             half of the year because the joint venture with the swiss exchange six was terminated with effect from
             30 june 2013 scoach europe ag a subsidiary to scoach holding sa changed its name to börse zer
             tifikate frankfurt ag and has been consolidated since q22013 the result from equity investments also
             includes nonrecurring income of 20 million in connection with this

             operating costs increased primarily because of the higher investments in growth and infrastructure projects
             as well as the special factors described above whereas net revenue declined slightly deutsche börse
             groups earnings before interest and tax ebit therefore decreased by 24 per cent in the year under review

ing noncurrent liabilities maturing in 2013 on extremely favourable terms in 2012 the financial

acquire all the shares in eurex zürich ag 2 due to the placement of a corporate bond with a

             onwards around 30 per cent of the planned savings were already realised in 2013 and another 30 per
             cent will be achieved in 2014 the cornerstones of this programme were adjusted in the course of the
             year the planned staff and nonpersonnel cost savings are divided into staff savings of 25 million and
             nonpersonnel cost savings of 45 million the target personnel cost savings result from a reduction in
             staff of 120 employees originally 200 employees as well as 50 executives the efficiency measures are
             aimed at offsetting the expected effects of inflation on the operating cost base in the coming years the
             company is expecting to incur implementation costs of about 110 million to achieve the efficiency im
             provements special factors relating to efficiency measures amounted to 816 million in 2013 the
             measures will thus ensure the necessary flexibility to continue the growth and infrastructure investments
             which will allow the company to exploit opportunities offered by structural and regulatory changes in the
             financial markets and to leverage the potential offered by markets such as asia

             comparison of results of operations with the forecast for 2013
             for 2013 deutsche börse group had forecast net revenue of approximately 18 billion to 20 billion a
             moderate increase in operating costs and adjusted ebit of approximately 08 billion to 10 billion this
             forecast was based on different scenarios about developments on the groups cash and derivatives mar
             kets depending on whether the capital market environment improved and the extent to which investors
             and market participants regained their confidence

             the conditions described in the results of operations section above mainly reflected the assumptions
             underlying the forecast that the capital market environment and investor confidence would remain largely
             unchanged in line with this the net revenue generated by deutsche börse group was slightly down on
             the previous year but in the middle of the forecast range

             adjusted for special items primarily from efficiency programmes and the settlement with ofac the
             groups operating costs rose by 5 per cent in financial year 2013 to 9676 million driven mainly by in
             creased investments in growth and infrastructure projects this is in line with the groups forecast which
             had predicted a moderate increase in operating costs

             ebit and net profit for the year both adjusted for special factors are at the upper end of the forecast
             range moreover since the successful refinancing of the groups longterm financial liabilities led to a sig
             nificant reduction in interest expense the group achieved an interest coverage ratio of 201 significantly
             above the minimum target of 16

             in addition deutsche börse aims to achieve a ratio of interestbearing gross debt to ebitda of no more
             than 15 at group level in 2013 the group had expected the ratio to slightly exceed this figure due to
             the positive change in exchange rates and the betterthanexpected business performance in the fourth
             quarter of 2013 this target was also met with the ratio being 15

eurex segment
the performance of the eurex derivatives segment largely depends on the trading activities of institution
al investors and proprietary trading by professional market participants the segments revenue is there
fore generated primarily from the combined transaction fees that eurex charges for trading and clearing
derivatives contracts

european derivatives are the main revenue drivers equity index derivatives generated 44 per cent of net
revenue interest rate derivatives contributed 25 per cent and equity derivatives 5 per cent us options
traded on the international securities exchange ise accounted for 12 per cent of net revenue the
other item 14 per cent includes revenue from eurex repo

in total 21912 million contracts were traded on deutsche börse groups derivatives exchanges eurex
and ise in 2013 a yearonyear decline of 4 per cent 2012 22920 million this is equivalent to a
daily average of around 88 million contracts 2012 90 million eurex generated a trading volume of
15524 million contracts for european futures and options down 6 per cent on the previous year
2012 16602 million the volume of us options traded on ise expanded by 1 per cent to
6388 million contracts 2012 6318 million the segments net revenue decreased by 3 per cent
to 7407 million 2012 7675 million operating costs rose by 12 per cent they include special
factors  mainly relating to efficiency programmes  in the amount of 232 million eurex generated
ebit of 3526 million 2012 4124 million

the market environment in 2013 was largely dominated by the central banks persistent low interest
rate policy the high levels of government debt in certain european states as well as a rise in share prices
and index levels combined with low market volatility the budget dispute in the united states which led
to a temporary government shutdown gave rise to uncertainty in the autumn in addition there were
farreaching regulatory reform projects in the financial services industry that could result in structural
costs for market participants and require adjustments to their business models in some cases a trend
towards positive economic signals on the equity markets which point to confidence in the real economy
and the available liquidity resulting from the low interest rate policies only boosted investments in de
rivatives to a limited extent overall trading on deutsche börse groups derivatives exchanges declined
yearonyear

european index derivatives remained the product group with the highest trading volume trading of
these derivatives however decreased by 16 per cent yearonyear to 6497 million contracts 2012
7704 million this sharp decline is due to lower volatility compared to the previous year and the cau
tion still being exercised by investors because of the uncertainty regarding the future development of the
euro zone economy as a whole by far the most commonly traded products were contracts on the euro

counter otc interest rate swaps by offering a fully integrated range of clearing and collateralisation
services for otc and exchangetraded derivatives under the roof of a single clearing house operating
within a single legal framework eurex clearing is anticipating the clearing obligation for otctraded
financial instruments that will result from of the implementation of the european market infrastructure
regulation emir the regulatory obligation for central clearing of otc derivatives in europe is not
expected to be introduced before the fourth quarter of 2014 at the end of 2013 eurexotc clear had
already registered 32 clearing participants and over 120 institutional investors in june 2013 eurex
clearing launched the prisma risk management system prisma applies a portfolio methodology for
calculating the collateral to be deposited margining that differs from the typical productbyproduct
approach by focusing on participants entire portfolios and thus allowing them to achieve capital effi
ciencies all products cleared by eurex clearing are being gradually transferred to the new system

the product portfolio was further expanded in the year under review to offer market participants as many
different alternatives as possible for implementing their trading strategies eurex had already responded
to market developments in the past by launching new derivatives in the form of products on french and
italian government bonds in 2013 eurex expanded the offering by adding a mediumterm interest rate
future as well as options on longterm french government bond futures eurex also continued to diversify
the range of index derivatives the additions included contracts on regional indices for developed markets
and country indices for emerging markets the indices are calculated as underlyings by the index pro
vider msci

when launching new products eurex not only relies on inhouse development but also works with
partner exchanges the best example is the successful cooperation with the korean exchange krx for
a product on koreas benchmark kospi index the trading volume in this product increased again by
around 32 per cent in the year under review adjusted for the minimum contract size imposed by the
korean exchange regulator in june 2012 following this example eurex entered into a cooperation
agreement with taifex the taiwan futures exchange the eurextaifex link is expected to go live in
may 2014 taiex index derivatives which are among asias most widely traded equity index contracts
will then be available for trading by eurex participants eurex also entered into partnerships with the
vienna stock exchange and the tel aviv stock exchange the declared aim is likewise to enable eurex
market participants to trade derivatives on austrian and israeli indices in future

eurex completed the migration of tradeable contracts to the new t7 trading system in june the system
is based on deutsche börse groups global trading infrastructure which had already been successfully
introduced at ise market participants now benefit from considerably improved performance and func
tions without losing any of the high system stability and availability to which they are accustomed t7
provides greater flexibility thus cutting the time to market for new products and functions moreover
t7 has been adapted to the derivatives market of the bombay stock exchange bse where it was
successfully rolled out in november 2013

             financial position

             cash flow
             cash and cash equivalents at deutsche börse group comprise cash and bank balances to the extent
             that these do not result from reinvesting current liabilities from cash deposits by market participants as
             well as receivables and liabilities from banking business with an original maturity of three months or less
             cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2013 amounted to 562 million 2012 5440 million
             the negative cash and cash equivalents item is due to the shift of current financial assets to financial
             assets with a maturity of more than three months for reporting date reasons the latter do not qualify
             as cash and cash equivalents and the cash flows associated with them have been allocated to investing
             activities

             deutsche börse group generated cash flows from operating activities before changes in reportingdate
             ccp positions of 7973 million in financial year 2013 2012 7262 million the significant year
             onyear increase in cash flows from operating activities is mainly due to the fact that the decline in
             net income for the year 1746 million was more than offset by the decrease in working capital
             1950 million and the rise in noncurrent provisions 344 million the decline in net income was
             primarily the result of the costs of the efficiency programme and the settlement offer from the office of
             foreign assets control ofac however neither of the two factors had yet had a major cash effect in
             2013 in addition tax payments of 933 million made in financial year 2013 2012 2584 million

capital management
as a rule the group aims to achieve a dividend distribution ratio of 40 to 60 per cent of adjusted con
solidated net income moreover it implements share buybacks in order to distribute to its shareholders
funds not required for the groups operating business and its further development this policy is deter
mined at all times by the companys capital requirements which depend on the legal and supervisory
framework as well as requirements relating to its credit rating economic capital and liquidity

customers expect their financial services provider to have conservative interest coverage and debtequity
ratios and to maintain strong credit ratings deutsche börse group therefore pursues its objective of
achieving an interest coverage ratio ratio of ebitda to interest expenses from financing activities of at
least 16 at group level in order to meet the rating agencies current requirements for an aa rating for
deutsche börse ag adjusted for merger and acquisition costs and for costs of efficiency programmes
deutsche börse group achieved an interest coverage ratio of 201 in the year under review 2012
152 this figure is based on a relevant interest expense of 532 million and an adjusted ebitda
of 10674 million the significant yearonyear increase in the interest coverage ratio is attributable
to the refinancing programme that started in 2012 and was successfully completed in the first quarter
of 2013 see the results of operations section the outstanding noncurrent liabilities that matured
in 2013 were refinanced on extremely favourable terms leading to a significant reduction in interest
expenses in addition deutsche börse aims to achieve a ratio of interestbearing gross debt to ebitda
of no more than 15 at group level the latter performance indicator in particular plays a material role
in maintaining the parent companys current aa rating in the year under review the group met the
target ratio at 15 this figure is based on gross debt of 16219 million and an adjusted ebitda
of 10674 million

             ued success of the clearstream segment which is active in securities custody and settlement deutsche
             börse ag also needs to maintain a strong credit profile for the benefit of activities at its eurex clearing ag
             subsidiary

             the interest coverage ratio is calculated using the interest expenses incurred to finance deutsche börse
             group among other factors excluding interest costs relating to group companies that also operate as
             financial institutions these include clearstream banking sa clearstream banking ag and eurex
             clearing ag interest expenses that are not related to group financing are not included in the interest
             coverage ratio

             because of the refinancing of the noncurrent financial liabilities the company anticipates a further
             reduction in the interest expense incurred to finance the group in 2014 for this reason the company
             expects the interest coverage ratio to improve further in the medium term

             deutsche börse ag has also publicly declared its intention to comply with certain additional key perfor
             mance indicators that the company believes correspond to an aa rating for example tangible equity
             equity less intangible assets should not fall below 700 million at clearstream international sa or
             400 million at clearstream banking sa including the proft participation rights of 150 million issued
             by clearstream banking sa in the year under review clearstream international sa has met this key
             performance indicator with an amount of 8208 million and clearstream banking sa with an amount
             of 8207 million for the clearstream subgroup the objective is to maintain an interest coverage ratio
             of at least 25 insofar as financial liabilities resulting from nonbanking business exist in the year under
             review as in the previous year clearstream had no financial liabilities resulting from nonbanking busi
             ness consequently no interest coverage ratio has been calculated

             dividends and share buybacks
             between 2005 and the end of 2012 deutsche börse group returned a total of around 50 billion to

for financial year 2013 deutsche börse ag is proposing that the annual general meeting resolve to pay
a dividend of 210 per nopar value share 2012 210 this dividend corresponds to a distribution
ratio of 61 per cent of consolidated net income adjusted for the special factors described in the results
of operations 2012 58 per cent also adjusted for special items for 1841 million nopar value shares
bearing dividend rights this would result in a total dividend of 3866 million 2012 3865 million
without the special distribution the aggregate number of shares bearing dividend rights results from
an ordinary share capital of 1930 million shares less 89 million treasury shares

bonds
in march 2013 deutsche börse ag successfully placed a corporate bond with a volume of 600 million
on the market the individual bonds have a maturity of five years and an annual coupon of 1125 per
cent in combination with the bonds issued in october 2012 which also amounted to 600 million
this allowed deutsche börse to refinance its outstanding noncurrent liabilities maturing in 2013 on
extremely favourable terms

             net assets

             deutsche börse groups noncurrent assets amounted to 87969 million as at 31 december 2013
             2012 51139 million they consisted primarily of intangible assets and financial assets as well
             as of financial instruments of eurex clearing ag the financial instruments of eurex clearing ag which
             amounted to 40586 million represented the largest item 2012 nil this asset is matched by a
             liability in the same amount the receivables and securities from banking business held by deutsche
             börse group as financial assets declined to 11783 million 2012 14850 million while goodwill
             of 20426 million was relatively stable compared to the previous year 2012 20784 million

             current assets amounted to 1805130 million as at 31 december 2013 2012 1896729 million
             the decline is attributable to the following factors

              a decrease in the financial instruments of eurex clearing ag item to 1535468 million 2012
               1563154 million in connection with its function as a central counterparty for cash and derivat
               ives markets
              a decrease in receivables and securities from banking business at clearstream to 95440 million

               2012 128082 million
              a decrease in restricted bank balances to 162217 million 2012 194506 million this occurred


               primarily because clearing participants provided a greater volume of securities and less cash as collat
               eral for eurex clearing ag in the year under review

             assets were financed by equity in the amount of 32680 million 2012 31696 million
             and liabilities in the amount of 1860419 million 2012 1916172 million the increase in
             equity compared with 31 december 2012 is mainly attributable to the rise in accumulated profit to
             20118 million 2012 19389 million

             noncurrent liabilities rose to 60199 million 2012 16164 million primarily because an amount
             of 40586 million is reported under financial instruments of eurex clearing ag this liability is
             matched by an asset in the same amount

             interestbearing liabilities rose to 15219 million 2012 11600 million the total increase is due
             to three factors

              in 2012 maturing bonds amounting to 5774 million were reclassified to other current liabilities
              in march 2013 deutsche börse ag successfully placed a corporate bond with a volume of
               6000 million on the market
              in april and june 2013 outstanding bonds totalling 7980 million matured




             current liabilities amounted to 1800220 million 2012 1900008 million the main changes in
             current liabilities occurred in the following items

                a decrease in the financial instruments of eurex clearing ag item to 1530468 million 2012
                 1563154 million in connection with its function as a central counterparty for cash and derivatives

 a decrease in liabilities from cash deposits by market participants to 162217 million
  2012 194506 million as a result of lower cash collateral provided by the clearing members
  of eurex clearing ag the amount decreased primarily because clearing participants provided
  a greater volume of securities and less cash as collateral for eurex clearing ag
 a decrease in liabilities from banking business at clearstream to 97253 million 2012

  128803 million
 a decrease in other current liabilities to 4121 million 2012 8884 million after bonds


  reclassified in 2012 from noncurrent interestbearing liabilities matured in 2013

overall deutsche börse group invested 1276 million in intangible assets and property plant and
equipment capital expenditure or capex in the year under review 2012 1457 million the groups
largest investments were made in the clearstream and eurex segments

working capital
working capital comprises current assets less current liabilities excluding technical closing date
balance sheet items and commercial paper current assets excluding technical closing date items
amounted to 5726 million 2012 4571 million as deutsche börse group collects fees for
most of its services on a monthly basis the trade receivables of 2188 million included in the
current assets as at 31 december 2013 31 december 2012 2118 million were relatively
low compared with net revenue the current liabilities of the group excluding technical closing
date items amounted to 10281 million 2012 7770 million excluding technical closing
date items and bonds maturing in 2013 the group therefore had negative working capital of
4555 million at the end of the year 2012 3199 million this development is primarily
due to the increase in other current provisions

technical closing date balance sheet items
the current receivables and securities from banking business and liabilities from banking business
balance sheet items are technical closing date items that were strongly correlated in the year under re
view and that fluctuated between approximately 9 billion and 15 billion 2012 between 11 billion
and 13 billion these amounts mainly represent customer balances in clearstreams international
settlement business

the financial instruments of eurex clearing ag balance sheet item relates to the function performed
by eurex clearing ag since the latter acts as the central counterparty for deutsche börse groups vari
ous markets its financial instruments are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value the financial
instruments of eurex clearing ag are described in detail in the risk report and in notes 3 15 and
36 to the consolidated financial statements

by eurex clearing ag and reported in the balance sheet under restricted bank balances the total
value of cash deposits at the balance sheet dates relevant for the year under review 31 march
30 june 30 september 31 december varied between 162 billion and 177 billion 2012 between

             overall assessment of the economic position by the executive board

             deutsche börse groups results of operations in financial year 2013 were within the range expected by
             the executive board despite the continuing difficult economic conditions and market uncertainty the
             groups net revenue declined by a slight 1 per cent in total operating costs were negatively impacted
             by special factors in particular the settlement payment made to ofac by clearstream and the costs of
             efficiency programmes as expected driven by higher investments in growth initiatives adjusted operat
             ing costs were slightly up on the previous year as a result ebit and net income for the period were
             somewhat lower than in the previous year

             the executive board believes that deutsche börse groups financial position was extremely sound in the
             year under review as in the previous year the company generated high operating cash flows in spite of
             the lower ebit the interest coverage ratio met the target of at least 16 at group level since the success
             ful refinancing of the groups longterm financial liabilities led to a significant reduction in the interest
             expense the group achieved an interest coverage ratio of 201 in addition deutsche börse aims to
             achieve a ratio of interestbearing gross debt to ebitda of no more than 15 at group level this target
             was also met even though the group had expected that the ratio would slightly exceed the figure of
             15 in 2013

rating agencies confirmed the groups credit quality by awarding it excellent ratings in 2013 however
the negative outlook for deutsche börse ag introduced in december 2012 remained unchanged the
main reason cited by sp was that the ratio of interestbearing gross debt to ebitda had risen to about
16 in the first nine months of financial year 2013 fitch changed the outlook for clearstream from neg
ative to stable giving its strengthened capital base as the reason

deutsche börse ag has offered its shareholders attractive returns for years  and financial year 2013
is no exception with a proposed dividend of 210 the distribution to shareholders is at the previous
years level of 210 despite lower earnings compared with the previous year the distribution ratio
has increased from 58 to 61 per cent adjusted for special items in both cases slightly in excess of
the upper end of the executive boards target range of between 40 and 60 per cent

emissions trading
in cooperation with the european energy exchange eex in leipzig eurex operates a regulated trans
parent marketplace for trading greenhouse gas co2 emissions this marketplace helps market partici
pants to meet their climate change targets under the kyoto protocol more easily market participants on
both exchanges can trade on a common platform and hedge against the risks arising from their activities
on the emissions market in addition to emission rights power gas and coal derivatives are also traded
on the eex markets

eex started trading in guarantee of origin certificates for green power in june 2013 these types of
certificates prove that a megawatt hour of power has been generated from renewable sources they are
issued exclusively for the purpose of identification and transparency the launch of exchange trading on
the eex derivatives market is an important milestone towards greater transparency in a market that was
previously exclusively based on overthecounter trading

information media
deutsche börse group has published a monthly carbon report since october 2010 which provides
information on the extent of co2 emissions in the energy sector and in industry and thus provides fun
damental data to analysts and traders in the co2 trading environment

eex operates a central and neutral platform known as transparency in energy markets featuring
generation data for power and gas by uploading their data market participants meet both their legal
disclosure requirements and the voluntary obligations for the sector

             energyefficient it management
             deutsche börse group fulfils its role as marketplace organiser primarily by developing and operating
             it solutions for this reason it management is an area that offers particular potential for improving
             sustainability performance the guiding principle behind sustainable it management at deutsche börse
             group is to achieve the maximum possible operating efficiency ie to optimise server and storage sys
             tem utilisation and reduce backup systems to the extent that market requirements for system security
             and speed permit another objective is to ensure that the servers currently being deployed are used
             continuously if possible by actively balancing the load

             deutsche börse groups server rooms in frankfurtmain have a flexible profile system that enables the
             strict separation of cold supply air and hot exhaust air known as cold aisle containment this profile
             system prevents cold and warm air from mixing thus saving the energy that would have been used to
             cool it or heat it again in addition the use of fibreoptic rather than copper cables and direct cooling
             of the server rooms permanently reduce power consumption in 2013 all servers at the equinix data
             centre were supplied with 100 per cent environmentally friendly hydroelectric power at the luxem
             bourg location the data centre is situated underneath the office building this allows an especially
             efficient use of energy as the exhaust air from the servers is used to heat the office premises here
             too further energy savings are achieved by cooling the server rooms directly with outdoor air outside
             the data centres too the focus is on sustainable energyefficient it solutions for example thin
             clients network computers without hard drives are used throughout the group and the hardware
             awarded the energy star label is selected specifically for its long lifespan and ecological certification
             in 2013 co2 emissions went down 30 per cent throughout the group in particular due to a new green
             power agreement in luxembourg

             resourceefficient business ecology
             for deutsche börse group environmental protection is an unconditional commitment to preserving the
             natural environment and resources the group aims to record its own ecological footprint as accurately
             as possible and to steadily reduce it facility management is highly relevant in this regard

             the cities of frankfurtmain and darmstadt and the frankfurtrheinmain regional authority conferred
             the green building 2013 architecture award on the groups headquarters for its ecologically innovative

risk report

deutsche börse groups core area of expertise includes solutions that enable its customers to efficiently
manage risk and collateral it is therefore even more important for the group to protect itself against risks
this section of the combined management report shows how the company deals with risks despite the
continuing difficult economic environment and regulatory developments which will be briefly described
in the first section of this risk report the risk profile in the year under review has remained largely stable

management further strengthened risk management in 2013 the second section of this risk report ex
plains the enhanced risk management strategy and shows how the group manages its risks

in the third part of this risk report the group describes the main types of risk and provides examples of
how it assesses and manages them in addition to the risk report the group sets out its future prospects
in the report on opportunities

deutsche börse group includes among other companies clearstream banking sa and clearstream
banking ag which form part of the clearstream holding group hereinafter clearstream and eurex
clearing ag these financial institutions are subject to banking supervision and corresponding statutory
requirements and therefore already meet the strictest requirements for risk management for details on
the requirements see the risk management environment section all of the other companies in the
group are aligned with the highest standard for comparable companies bestinclass risk manage
ment across the group therefore meets the highest standards

with its range of risk management services deutsche börse group aims to make a sustainable contribu
tion to society in particular by ensuring integrity and safety on the markets in its function as a capital
markets organiser and by increasing the distribution efficiency of the markets through its price discovery
function for its customers deutsche börse group also performs important risk management functions
such as providing client asset protection solutions and thus contributes to the efficiency and systemic
stability of capital markets the groups risk management ensures that it can continuously offer these
services



risk management environment

the fallout from the financial crisis has led to increased regulation of financial markets the new regula
tions affect deutsche börse group both directly and indirectly through its clients on the one hand the
changed regulatory environment offers the group opportunities as a marketplace organiser it certainly
contributes significantly to the desired stability integrity and transparency of the capital markets see
the report on opportunities on the other hand the implementation of new regulations such as the
amendment to the european unions mifid regulation and the attempts to introduce a financial trans
action tax mean considerable burdens as well as business risks for the group

in particular the regulatory requirements for the risk management of financial institutions have been ex
tended examples are the mindestanforderungen an das risikomanagement marisk german minimum
requirements for risk management the gesetz zur abschirmung von risiken und zur planung der sanie
rung und abwicklung von kreditinstituten und finanzgruppen riskabschg german act on ringfencing
and recovery and resolution planning for credit institutions and financial groups risk management re
quirements set out in the european market infrastructure regulation emir the principles for financial
market infrastructure of the financial stability board fsb and the international organization of securi
ties commissions iosco and the act implementing the capital requirements directive crd iv the

144   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             principles of the fsb and iosco in particular place demands on the risk management of financial mar
             ket infrastructures the crd iv could mean that regulated financial institutions would have to report
             higher equity thanks to measures such as leverage ratio put simply a minimum ratio of equity to un
             weighted total assets plus offbalance sheet risk positions which would increase the cost of equity

             these regulations also directly affect the financial institutions of the group clearstream and eurex
             clearing ag this applies in particular to the marisk from bundesanstalt für finanzdienstleistungs
             aufsicht bafin the german federal financial supervisory authority which was most recently revised
             in december 2012 this was pillar ii under basel ii dictates to banks how they must organise their
             risk management system and therefore also applies to clearstream and eurex clearing ag it sets out
             the principles governing how much equity a bank must hold for its business to cover counterparty credit
             risk market risk and operational risk and stipulates conditions for outsourcing compliance and auditing
             in addition clearstream and eurex clearing ag have prepared recovery plans in accordance with the
             riskabschg above and beyond this requirement deutsche börse group is also currently and voluntarily
             developing a groupwide recovery plan for the event that this should be necessary at clearstream and
             eurex clearing ag

             there are also business risks for deutsche börse group from the new regulations this is because
             the new regulations change the structure of the entire financial system for example a law was passed
             in the summer of 2013 in germany requiring banks to outsource proprietary trading to independent
             companies as of 2016 in december 2013 britain passed a bill to ringfence the retail banking system
             at the same time what is known as the volcker rule was adopted in the united states aimed at restrict
             ing proprietary trading there and curbing speculative transactions the riskabschg has similar goals
             deutsche börse group welcomes regulatory measures that reduce systemic risks with its products and
             services the group contributes significantly to increasing system stability

             in light of the new regulatory requirements deutsche börse group has compiled a comprehensive plan
             for enhancing its risk management risk management implementation plan in order to continue to pro
             vide the highest possible standard a large part of the defined measures will be implemented in 2014
             for a more detailed description of the measures see the outlook section



             risk strategy and risk management

             deutsche börse groups risk strategy is aligned with its business model and business strategy it provides
             the infrastructure for reliable and secure capital markets assists constructively in their regulation and
             takes a leading role in all of its businesses areas in the process the group focuses on its risk appetite
             and riskbearing capacity it consciously assumes risks in order to satisfy market needs and maximise
             business opportunities however it curbs this appetite with a defined upper limit on the risks it takes

             management further strengthened and reorganised risk management in 2013 the basis for internal risk
             management is the groupwide strategy for detecting and minimising risks which is focused on what
             is known as risk appetite each division is individually responsible for managing its risks as part of the
             groupwide risk management regulations the executive board of deutsche börse group has overall
             responsibility and steers the groupwide risk management system in order to take possible interactions
             into account and to make use of synergies among other things this coordinated process ensures that

the group and its companies act quickly and effectively in the event that a single system fails or even if
several systems fail simultaneously this section of the risk report shows how the group has established
risk management as an integral part of company management activities and that it has established three
principles for the risk strategy as well as setting out the approaches and methods used by the group to
regularly monitor and manage its riskbearing capacity and risk appetite

implementation in the organisational structure and workflow
the risk strategy applies to the entire deutsche börse group risk management functions processes
and responsibilities are binding for all employees and organisational units of deutsche börse group
to ensure that all employees take a careful approach in dealing with risks risk management is firmly
anchored in the organisational structure and workflows and is supported by corresponding measures
such as risk management training the executive board is responsible for risk management overall
within individual companies it is the responsibility of the management which ensures it is cut fully
up to date in a timely manner with all of its risks

the supervisory board of deutsche börse ag monitors the effectiveness of the risk management system
and examines its risk strategy and risk appetite on a yearly basis the supervisory board has delegated
the evaluation to its audit committee which regularly assesses the appropriateness and effectiveness of
the risk management system to monitor the implementation of the risk management roadmap the su
pervisory board has established an interim risk management roadmap committee

centrally coordinated risk management in five stages
risk management is implemented in a fivestage process all potential losses should be identified in
good time recorded centrally and evaluated quantitatively as far as possible if necessary management
measures must then be recommended and their implementation monitored see the course of the
fivestage risk management system chart the first stage determines the risks and possible causes of
loss or operational hitches in the second stage the business divisions regularly  and immediately if
urgent  report to grm the risks that they determine and quantify in the third stage grm assesses the
potential for risk while in the fourth stage the business divisions manage the risks by avoiding mitigat
ing or transferring them or by actively taking them the fifth and final stage involves informing the re
sponsible executive board members and committees of significant risks their assessment and possible
emergency measures in addition to the quarterly reports grm compiles ad hoc reports for the executive
boards and supervisory boards at clearstream and eurex clearing ag the corresponding risk manage
ment functions report to the executive boards and supervisory boards internal auditing monitors that
the risk management system is adhered to

management at clearstream and eurex clearing ag are informed quarterly about their respective com
panys risk situation and capital resources like the regulators management also receive an annual re
port in line with the internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap in compliance with pillar iii
requirements under basel ii clearstream and eurex clearing ag also report in detail on their business
activities in particular they regularly inform the supervisory authorities of their risk management meth
ods and capital resources assessment the icaap report and the report on business activities are also
made available to the public

three principles
deutsche börse groups risk strategy is based on three principles

1 risk limitation  protecting and ensuring continuity of operations
capital is expected to be exhausted no more than once in 5000 years an operating loss may occur no
more than once every hundred years accordingly one goal is to ensure a probability of 9998 per cent
or more that the total capital will not be lost another is to ensure a probability of 990 per cent or more
that deutsche börse at least breaks even in terms of its net income as measured at the ebit level thus
this principle establishes how much risk the group must be able to withstand and also the level of risk
appetite that it has

2 supporting growth in the various business divisions
risk management supports the business divisions in expanding their business with this principle
the group strengthens its growth strategy by requiring that risks are identified and clearly communicated
in this way it aims to make informed strategic decisions within the framework of the risk appetite that
it has defined

3 appropriate riskreturn ratio
the return on equity should exceed the cost of equity deutsche börse group has set itself the goal that
risk and return should be reasonably balanced not only for each business division in general but also
for each individual region product and customer

             risk management approaches and methods
             deutsche börse group uses various quantitative and qualitative risk management approaches and meth
             ods to monitor and manage its risk profile the aim is to provide as complete a picture as possible of its
             risk situation at all times

             deutsche börse group assesses and reports operational financial and business risks using the same
             approach the unregulated units also use value at risk var as a uniform measure this value quantifies
             the risks and represents the upper limit of the cumulative loss that deutsche börse group may incur
             within a specified period of time eg for the next twelve months principle 1 above also defines a confi
             dence level for each of the orderly liquidation and the going concern the regulatory capital requirements
             for the financial institutions are also determined of course furthermore deutsche börse group applies
             stress tests to analyse its risks

             liquidation principle what risk can the capital cover
             in accordance with the first part of principle 1 of the risk strategy deutsche börse group is not expected
             to exhaust its riskbearing capacity in more than 002 per cent of all years the group determines the
             economic capital that it requires for this required economic capital ec with the help of var it there
             fore calculates its ec at a confidence level of 9998 per cent so that it can protect itself financially
             against extreme events in the following twelve months in line with the principle of prudence the group
             assumes a correlation of one between risk types and between the risks at different group companies
             when making calculations ie it assumes that all possible risks would occur simultaneously it therefore
             consciously disregards the fact that diversification would actually reduce the overall risk deutsche börse
             group thus uses the most conservative approach requiring the highest ec the ecs calculated for clear
             stream and eurex clearing ag also meet the pillar ii requirements under basel ii

             deutsche börse group determines its riskbearing capacity based on the reported equity in accordance
             with international financial reporting standards ifrss it adapts this figure for precautionary reasons
             among other things to take into account that it may not be possible to dispose of intangible assets at
             their carrying amounts in case of extreme stress clearstream and eurex clearing ag use their regulatory
             capital to determine their riskbearing capacity for details see note 20 to the consolidated financial
             statements

             for management purposes grm regularly determines the ratio of the ec to the riskbearing capacity
             this indicator is known as the utilisation of riskbearing capacity in so doing it answers a key risk man
             agement question how much risk can the group afford and what risk is it currently exposed to as at
             31 december 2013 deutsche börse groups ec was 1630 million and the available riskbearing
             capacity was 2395 million the ratio of ec to riskbearing capacity is therefore well within the stipu
             lated maximum risk otherwise the group would use up its entire riskbearing capacity in a worstcase
             scenario and would be liquidated the liquidation concept therefore assumes that liquidation of the
             group gone concern is avoided

             going concern principle what risks can earnings absorb
             since the year under review deutsche börse group has also used an approach that assumes an orderly
             continuation of the group in the event of a crisis going concern the group calculates earnings at

                                                                                                             risk report




risk ear as indicator this indicator corresponds to the second part of principle 1 of its risk strategy
ie that an operating loss may occur no more than once in a hundred years in other words there
should be a probability of 990 per cent or more that deutsche börse should at least break even net
income measured in terms of ebit the ear determined for the going concern principle is compared
with the risk appetite risk appetite is measured in terms of the projected earnings before interest and
tax ebit and allocated to the group segments as at 31 december 2013 ear were 589 million
which would be comparable to the adjusted ebit 2013 of 840 million

regulatory capital requirements
clearstream and eurex clearing ag must also calculate their capital requirements for various risk types
see the chart below according to the pillar i requirements under basel ii they use a standard ap
proach for analysing and evaluating credit and market price risks in this approach risk weightings are
applied in accordance with counterparty ratings

for operational risks they proceed differently clearstream has used the significantly more complex ad
vanced measurement approach ama for this in all business units since 2008 it therefore complies
with the regulatory capital requirements for operational risks according to the solvabilitätsverordnung
solvv german solvency regulation under basel ii the method which has been approved by and is
regularly tested by bafin allows regulatory capital to be allocated to businesses precisely it is particu
larly suitable because at clearstream operational risk accounts for a greater proportion of the overall risk
than for a typical bank while the proportion attributable to financial risks is smaller for operational risks
eurex clearing ag uses the basic indicator approach to calculate regulatory capital the basis for calcu
lating the basic indicator is known as the relevant indicator which is calculated from certain items in
the profit and loss account of the eurex segment as a flat rate 15 per cent of the threeyear average of
this indicator is required as operational risk capital

stress tests
for clearstream and eurex clearing ag deutsche börse group also uses stress tests to analyse business
risks as well as operational and financial risks these stress tests simulate the occurrence of extreme
losses or an accumulation of major losses within one year possible risk scenarios are set out for this
the scenarios describe potential loss events the probability that they will occur and the estimated loss

             ical scenarios and extreme market conditions that actually occurred in the past are calculated losses
             incurred by the group itself in the past are not suitable because to date there has been only one
             case of loss on this scale see the legal disputes and business practice section the settlement

             risk description

             the following section describes the types of risk that deutsche börse group must manage as a rule
             and gives examples of the risks it actually faces using examples it also explains the measures that
             deutsche börse group uses to prevent risks occurring and to minimise their financial effects firstly
             however there follows a brief explanation of the risk profile that differs from most other financial
             services providers as financial risks play a significantly smaller role for deutsche börse group

             risk profile
             deutsche börse group differentiates between the three standard types of risk operational financial and
             business risk there are also project risks that the group does not specifically quantify as their impact
             is already reflected in the three traditional risk types

             low level of typical bank risk
             the risks of deutsche börse groups financial institutions differ fundamentally from those of other finan
             cial service providers while credit and market price risks for a typical universal bank account for more
             than 80 per cent of the regulatory capital requirements credit risks only account for around 16 per cent
             and market risks for 1 per cent for the financial institutions in deutsche börse group clearstream and
             eurex clearing ag have a structurally lower risk in comparison with other banks because they act as in
             termediaries and therefore do not themselves trade on the financial markets as a distinct business divi
             sion for example consequently deutsche börse groups financial institutions do not have to bear the




             regulatory capital requirements of clearstream           required economic capital of deutsche börse

associated high trade risks on the contrary it offers market participants services such as collateral and
risk management that reduce their risk from trading activities its banking business mainly consists of
reliable clearing settlement and custody activities as well as collateral management

the regulatory capital requirements for clearstream and eurex clearing ag arise primarily from opera
tional risks see the   regulatory capital requirements of clearstream and eurex clearing ag chart

operational risks higher than financial and business risks
the utilisation of riskbearing capacity in the liquidation principle and of risk appetite in the going con
cern principle are used as internal management indicators across the whole deutsche börse group see
the     risk management approaches and methods section for an explanation of the terms apart from
the above mentioned financial and operational risks business risks are also identified and assessed
business risks refer in particular to potential threats to revenue such as price pressure or loss in market
share under the liquidation principle financial risks amount to almost one quarter of the total risks of
deutsche börse group business risks also represent slightly less than one quarter with 22 per cent of
the total all the more important for the deutsche börse group is the third typical risk type with 54 per
cent operational risks amount to more than half of the total risk see the      required economic capital
of deutsche börse group by risk types chart

a large part of the risk is associated with the clearstream and eurex segments see the       required
economic capital by segment chart in accordance with the size of the business in terms of sales reve
nue and earnings in the year under review the clearstream proportion was at 46 per cent for eurex
this figure was 35 per cent in the eurex segment the risks primarily result from the business of eurex
clearing ag the market data  services segment had a share of 11 per cent and xetra of 8 per cent
in contrast to the regulatory capital requirements this includes business divisions that are not subject
to banking regulations

in total deutsche börse group has calculated a required economic capital of 1630 million in
accordance with the liquidation principle the required ec compares to a riskbearing capacity of
2395 million

             a similar split may be seen in earnings at risk here also the business segments with the largest propor

             see the     earnings at risk by segment chart

             deutsche börse group assigns indicators to each risk to estimate how likely it is to occur and what
             financial effect it could have it distinguishes four probability levels very low low medium and high
             as well as four financial impact levels low medium substantial and a risk to the company as a going
             concern however none of the assessed risks reach the fourth impact level neither individually nor
             in total this means that none jeopardises the existence of the group as a going concern

             the three types of risk as well as the project risks are explained below and illustrated with specific ex
             amples

             the probability of the risk occurring can be categorised as follows
              very low probability of risk occurring is less than 1 per cent

              low probability of risk occurring is greater than 1 per cent but less than 10 per cent

              medium probability of risk occurring is greater than 10 per cent but less than 50 per cent

              high probability of risk occurring is greater than 50 per cent




             the financial effects can be classified into the following four categories
              low financial loss could be up to 10 per cent of ebit
              medium financial loss could be up to 50 per cent of ebit

              substantial financial loss could be up to 100 per cent of ebit

              risk to the business as a going concern financial loss could equal the available riskbearing capacity




             the risks listed below as examples can be assessed based on these categories

             1 operational risks
              incorrect processing of client instructions eg capital increases
              miscalculation of indices

              mishandling of trading instructions

              losses caused by force majeure eg natural disasters terrorism

              losses from ongoing litigation

              infringements of sanctions or supranational regulations




             2 financial risks
              default of a credit counterparty
              losses from impairment of fund assets for pension plans

              loss of a client and an associated liquidity bottleneck




             3 business risks
              entry of new competitors on the european trading market
              worsening of the european government debt crisis

              decline in trading activity

              new regulatory requirements

from todays perspective none of these risks can lead to financial loss that is rated as substantial
significant risks could arise only from a combination of extreme events that have a very low probability

   failure of a trading system lasting more than one week in a highly volatile market environment
   simultaneous failure of several large systemically important banks

these extreme events that could lead to a loss corresponding to more than 50 per cent of annual ebit
are rated as having a probability of less than 1 per cent such extreme events have not occurred to date
they are also known as tail risks

grm assesses these risks continuously and reports on its assessment in the form of a risk matrix to
the executive board of deutsche börse group

operational risks
operational risks for deutsche börse group relate to availability processing material goods as well
as litigation and business practice see the    chart below personnel risks are not quantified directly
but influence the quantification process indirectly via the operational risk categories the operational
risks amount to just under one half of the total group risk

system availability
operational resources such as the trading systems xetra and t7 are essential for the services offered
by deutsche börse group they should never fail in order to ensure that market participants can
trade securities or derivatives at any time and without delay the group therefore sees the availability
of these systems as an important risk indicator in line with the companys risk strategy the business
areas are responsible for monitoring these risk indicators

the potential loss would be larger the longer one of these systems failed however this has never
happened in practice in the past only limited failures have occurred with both xetra and t7 and
its predecessor system for short periods of time or affecting only a few products in december of
the year under review for example there were three minor faults in t7s trading operations the
longestfault lasted for only approximately three minutes and was limited to futures trading on the
euro stoxx 50 index this supports the view that the probability of a system failure lasting
longer than a week in an extremely volatile market is very low however the potential financial
effect of such an event could be significant if claims are justified and asserted

             the probability of a longlasting failure for one day or longer of the margin calculation system of the
             central counterparty at eurex clearing ag or the settlement system at the international central securities
             depository and settlement service provider clearstream banking sa is also low in actual fact no such
             failure has ever occurred the effects are categorised here as medium

             in general availability risk represents the largest operational risk for deutsche börse group the group
             subjects it to regular stress tests which check not only what happens when its own systems fail but also
             when suppliers fail to deliver

             processing
             risks can also arise if a service provided to a customer is inadequate and this leads to complaints or
             legal disputes such as in the settlement of securities transactions due to defective products and pro
             cesses or erroneous manual entries for example corporate actions eg capital increases or securities
             exchange by an issuer of securities might be missed or indices such as dax miscalculated such pro
             cessing errors can occur with a medium probability but have hardly ever happened to date the possible
             losses in the case of client instructions such as the abovementioned corporate actions would be classi
             fied as medium while by contrast losses relating to the calculation of indices would be low to date
             there have been no client claims in this regard

             if a xetra or eurex client complains to the market supervision department of deutsche börse about
             incorrect trading instructions the latter checks immediately whether the notification is justified and then
             issues corresponding trading instructions to the market participants the risk here is of a notification
             being initially incorrectly assessed as unjustified if the client concerned then closes their position them
             selves for example they could demand a refund of the additional costs incurred however such errors
             have almost never occurred and the probability is therefore considered low to date no significant client
             claims have been brought and the potential financial effects are rated as low

             other sources of error may be attributable to suppliers or to defective products or mistakes that may
             lead to the loss of client assets the group aims to register all complaints and formal objections as a
             key indicator of processing risk

             physical assets
             operational risks include natural disasters accidents terrorism and sabotage for example a data centre
             could be destroyed or a major storm could severely damage office buildings for instance the ise office
             in new york usa was damaged by a severe storm although the financial consequences were only minor
             business continuity management bcm planning aim at averting significant financial damage see the
                chart of the same name there is only a low probability of the risk of force majeure materialising and
             in the event that it does it should have a low impact

             legal disputes and business practice
             losses can also result from ongoing legal proceedings deutsche börse judges the probability that this
             operational risk will occur to be medium although damage can be substantial as a result grm contin
             ually monitors ongoing legal proceedings these can occur if deutsche börse group breaches laws or
             requirements enters into inadequate contractual agreements or fails to observe case law to a sufficient
             degree legal risks also include losses due to fraud and labour law issues they further include losses as

measures to mitigate operational risks
deutsche börse group takes active measures to reduce deutsche börse groups operational risk the
most important of these are emergency and contingency plans insurance contracts and precautions
to ensure that regulations are observed compliance

156   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             emergency and contingency plans
             it is essential for deutsche börse group to provide its products and services as reliably as possible
             it must maintain its business operations and safeguard against emergencies and disasters if its core
             processes and resources are not available there is a substantial risk for the entire group and even a
             potential systemic risk for the financial markets in general as a result deutsche börse group has set
             up a system of emergency and disaster plans covering the entire group bcm this covers all processes
             which ensure continuing operations in the event of a crisis and significantly reduces availability risk
             these include precautions in relation to all important resources systems workspaces employees sup
             pliers including the redundant design of essential it systems and the technical infrastructure as well
             as emergency workspaces for employees in core functions at all important locations examples of such
             precautions are listed in the chart below

             preparations for emergencies and crises
             the group has introduced and tested a management process for emergencies and crises which enables
             it to respond quickly and in a coordinated manner this process is intended to minimise the effects on
             business processes and on the market and to enable a quick return to regular operations all business
             areas have appointed emergency managers to act as central contacts and take responsibility during
             emergencies and crises the emergency managers inform the executive board or alert them in the case
             of severe incidents in the event of a crisis the responsible board member acts as the crisis manager
             the emergency and contingency plans are tested regularly by realistically simulating critical situations
             such tests are generally carried out unannounced grm reports any problems that occur to the executive
             board evaluates the results and issues recommendations the test results are evaluated based on the
             following criteria

              functionally effective the measures must be technically successful
              executable the employees must be familiar with the emergency procedure and be able to execute it
              timely emergency measures must ensure a restart of operations within the intended time period

insurance contracts
operational risks which deutsche börse group cannot or does not wish to bear itself are transferred to
insurance companies if this is possible at a reasonable price all insurance contracts are coordinated
centrally so that the entire deutsche börse group has at all times consistent insurance cover offering an
attractive costbenefit ratio the insurance contracts are checked individually and approved by the cfo
of deutsche börse ag

compliance
the compliance function and the individual business segments have the task of protecting the group
against risks and physical or nonphysical damage that could arise if employees act in contravention of
applicable laws supervisory requirements market standards or principles of proper corporate govern
ance or if the expectations of public authorities customers investors or the general public are not met

compliance management at deutsche börse group comprises a range of rules procedures and controls
to help the business areas comply with the applicable laws and regulatory requirements in particular
the system specifies measures to enable the group to meet its obligations relating to the prevention of
money laundering and terrorism financing as well as compliance with financial sanctions rules further
more it contains rules and procedures to prevent insider trading and market manipulation including an
insider register in accordance with securities law requirements the groups compliance function is also
responsible for issuing guidance on how to avoid conflicts of interest fight corruption and prevent crimi
nal offences in general by issuing appropriate rules it ensures that banking and professional secrecy is
maintained and personal data is protected in addition compliance management develops guidance for
the internal control system to protect the group itself its investors and customers from financial losses
another protection mechanism is the whistleblower hotline this system can be used to inform a third
party of suspected criminal acts or contraventions of the groups compliance regulations anonymously
if preferred

deutsche börse group introduced its groupwide independent compliance function and adopted compli
ance principles many years ago it has continuously enhanced its compliance management system ever
since in light of increased regulatory requirements including the agreements made with the us de
partment of the treasury deutsche börse group has resolved to significantly strengthen and expand
its compliance management system some measures were already taken during the year under review
others are planned for the current year they meet the revised minimum requirements for risk manage
ment marisk of the bundesanstalt für finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht bafin german federal financial
supervisory authority moreover the group resolved in 2013 to implement stricter rules and measures
to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing and to ensure compliance with financial sanctions
rules in addition the requirements relating to the fight against bribery and corruption have been revised
and tightened considerably

the group aims to increase transparency in securities custody and to support and encourage the devel
opment of sectorwide standards as part of this drive it initially enhanced its methodology for capturing
categorising and assessing potential risks arising from different customer groups business partners mar
kets and business activities of the group based on the results of the different risk analyses the checks
applied when establishing business relationships and opening accounts are currently being tightened
in addition regular checks on business partners customers and customer accounts are being intensified
the checks include whether the purpose and extent of existing business relationships are plausible or

158   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             whether the customer information and documents on file are complete and up to date they focus in
             particular on transactions settled and portfolios held in custody via the group companies in order to get
             a better understanding of the beneficial owners of the items under custody moreover reviews are carried
             out to determine the extent to which the groups business partners have themselves introduced compli
             ance programmes and whether they maintain business relationships with sanctioned parties access to
             omnibus accounts will in future be limited to customers who meet certain compliance and risk criteria
             and confirm that they do not allow the account to be used in a way that would lead to the contravention
             of sanctions automatic and regular checks on transaction and portfolio data will also be tightened with
             regard to both financial sanctions and other compliance risks for example transaction information will
             automatically be compared against reference lists before the transaction is settled in addition the group
             will in future track the development of its customers transaction and portfolio volumes more closely and
             monitor how they are using the groups products and services this will also include a plausibility check
             the aim is to protect the group from being misused to commit financial crime

             in response to tighter international rules on fighting corruption and bribery in business the group has
             also taken measures to protect itself from legal or reputational consequences as well as any resulting
             losses this applies to acts committed by employees of the group or third parties acting on behalf of the
             group in this context guidance has been introduced in particular to ensure more detailed checks and
             contractual arrangements governing new and existing business partners and for managing dealings with
             officials in addition the group has tightened its rules on providing and accepting gifts and other bene
             fits such as invitations to meals and entertainment by employees and third parties acting on behalf of
             the group the approval process has also been made subject to stricter requirements

             in support of the introduction of the measures described above deutsche börse group has significantly
             expanded its compliance training programme for employees all employees receive more frequent and
             more comprehensive information and training on the latest compliance issues either at classroom ses
             sions tailored to the area of work of the employees to be trained or through computerbased training
             programmes which test comprehension to ensure training success

             the expansion of the compliance management system also prompted the group to strengthen the
             compliance function by adding new team members firstly additional compliance officers have been
             deployed at the level of the regulated group companies and secondly there are plans to introduce
             compliance officers at other international locations of the group by taking these measures deutsche
             börse group will be able to meet further increases in regulatory requirements and expectations

             financial risks
             deutsche börse group classifies its financial risks into credit market price and liquidity risks see the
                 financial risks of deutsche börse group chart at group level these risks account for about 24 per
             cent of the entire risk profile since liquidity risks are not quantified in the ec this information only in

             risks primarily apply to the groups financial institutions as a result the following explanation focuses
             on clearstream and eurex clearing ag

credit risk
credit risk describes the danger that a contract partner might not meet its contractual obligations or not
in full measurement criteria include the degree to which the credit line has been used the deposited
collateral as well as concentration risk clearstream and eurex clearing ag often have shortterm claims
against contract partners totalling several billion euros overall but these are usually be secured by col
lateral deposited by the market participants the group tests credit risk coverage by means such as ex
amining how resilient the group would be if its biggest counterparty were to default among other ways
in addition it regularly assesses the reliability of emergency plans for clearstream and eurex clearing ag
in the case of credit defaults

furthermore clearstream banking sa is exposed to credit risk arising from its strategic securities lend
ing transactions aslplus only selected banks act as borrowers all borrowing transactions are fully
collateralised only selected bonds may be used as collateral these must be rated at least a by the
standard  poors sp rating agency or the equivalent from other agencies in the case of shortterm
securities without individual ratings the issuers must be rated at least a1

clearstream grants credits to its customers in order to make settlement more efficient this type of
credit business is however fundamentally different from the classic lending business firstly credit
is extended solely on a very shortterm basis normally for less than a day secondly it is largely
collateralised and granted to highly creditworthy clients furthermore the credit lines granted can
be revoked at any time

according to its terms and conditions eurex clearing ag only enters into transactions with its clearing
members clearing mainly relates to defined securities rights derivatives and emission allowances that
are traded on specific stock exchanges eurex clearing ag also offers this service for some overthe
counter otc products such as interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements it serves as an inter
mediary between the parties to the transaction  central counterparty in order to reduce its customers
credit risk by offsetting receivables clearing members deposit collateral with eurex clearing ag to re
duce their reciprocal default risk

to date no default by a borrower with a secured credit line has resulted in material financial losses
deutsche börse group continues to view the probability that one of its borrowers could become insolvent
and that this could lead to losses for the group as low it considers the impact of such an event to be

             low if the credit line in question is collateralised and medium if it is uncollateralised the probability of
             a counterparty to an uncollateralised credit defaulting is considered to be very low the highestprofile
             defaults in recent years include mf global in 2012 and lehman brothers international europe in 2008
             in both cases the safeguards worked so that neither clearstream nor eurex clearing ag suffered a
             financial loss the following reducing credit risk section outlines how credit risk is reduced

             credit risk can also arise from cash investments the treasury department is responsible here and
             has groupwide authority treasury largely makes collateralised investments of funds blonging to group
             companies as well as clearstream and eurex clearing ag customers to date counterparty default has
             not led to any material loss for the group for either collateralised or uncollateralised investments the
             probability the default of a counterparty to an uncollateralised cash investment could lead to al loss is
             considered to be low although the financial loss itself could be significant

             the financial impact of several large systemically important banks defaulting simultaneously could be
             substantial the probability of this scenario occurring is considered to be very low

             reducing credit risk
             clearstream and eurex clearing ag assess the creditworthiness of potential customers resp counterpar
             ties of an investment before entering into business relations the two companies do this in the same way
             they determine individual customers credit lines based on regular creditworthiness checks which they
             supplement with ad hoc analyses if necessary they define haircuts for securities posted as collateral
             according to the risk involved and continually review their appropriateness clearstream includes all
             relevant risk factors when determining haircut and the margin and allows a specific deduction to each
             the total haircut is calculated by adding together the individual margins for the relevant risk factors

             in order to identify potential concentration risks from individual counterparties clearstream further ana
             lyses the var at the level of the clearstream holding group for this purpose credit risk vars are calcu
             lated at the level of individual counterparties and compared to the overall credit risk vars due to its
             business model clearstream focuses almost exclusively on financial sector customers however there
             is no material concentration of credit risk on any individual counterparty

             given the size and volatility of its clients liabilities eurex clearing ag has developed a leadingedge
             collateral management system which is described in detail in the following section

             safety for both participants and the clearing house
             each clearing member must prove that it has capital equal to at least the amount that eurex clearing ag
             has defined for the different markets the amount of capital for which evidence must be provided de
             pends on the risk in order to mitigate eurex clearing ags risk that clearing members might default be
             fore setting open transactions clearing members are obliged to deposit collateral in the form of cash or
             securities margins on a daily basis and if required to meet additional intraday margin calls

             eurex clearing ag only permits securities with a high credit quality to be used as collateral it continually
             reviews what collateral it will accept and covers market risk using corresponding haircuts with a con
             fidence level of at least 999 per cent it applies a further haircut to collateral from issuers in highrisk
             countries or excludes them from being furnished as collateral altogether the risk inputs are checked
             regularly and the safety margins are calculated daily for each security in addition a minimum safety
             margin applies to all securities

shares   services   2013   horizons   strategic perspectives   responsibility   governance   management report    financial statements   notes   161
                                                                                                    risk report




the margins are calculated separately for clearing member accounts and client accounts gains and
losses which result from intraday changes to the value of financial instruments are either settled in cash
by the counterparties variation margin or deposited with eurex clearing ag as collateral by the seller
due to the change in the equivalent value of the item premium margin in the case of bond repo or
equity transactions either the buyer or the seller is collected from the margin current liquidating margin
depending on how the purchase price performs compared to the current value of the financial instru
ments the purpose of these margins is to offset gains and losses

in addition eurex clearing ag protects itself before default by a clearing member against any risk that
the value of the positions in the latters account will deteriorate in the period before the account is settled
by obtaining additional collateral this additional collateral is called additional margin in riskbased mar
gining and initial margin in the prisma method portfoliobased risk management the target confidence
level here is at least 990 per cent eurex clearing ag checks regularly whether the margins match the
requested confidence level and currently calculates the margins using both riskbased margining and the
prisma method the new prisma method is already available for a variety of products and the intention
is for it to fully replace riskbased margining over time it takes into account the clearing members entire
portfolio and takes historical and stress scenarios into account when calculating the margin require
ments the objective is to cover market fluctuations for the entire liquidation period until the account
is settled

in addition to the margins for current transactions each clearing member contributes to a clearing fund
depending on its individual risk profile this fund is jointly liable for the financial consequences of a de
fault by a clearing member to the extent that this cannot be covered by the members individual margin
its own contributions to the clearing fund and eurex clearing ags retained earnings eurex clearing ag
has set up a separate clearing fund for clearing credit default swaps cdss eurex clearing ag uses
regular stress tests to check whether its clearing funds match the risks this involves subjecting all
current transactions and their collateral to market price fluctuations at a confidence level of at least
999 per cent in order to be able to determine potential losses in excess of a clearing members individ
ual margins the impact of a potential default on the clearing fund is simulated eurex clearing ag has
defined limits which when exceeded trigger an immediate adjustment to the scope of the clearing fund
if necessary the following lines of defence are available in case a clearing member is unable to meet
its obligations to eurex clearing ag due to delays or defaults

 first the outstanding positions and transactions of the clearing member concerned can be netted
  andor closed from a risk perspective by entering into appropriate backtoback transactions or they
  can be settled in cash
 any potential shortfall that might be incurred in connection with such a closing or cash settlement


  as well as associated costs would be covered in the first instance by the collateral provided by the
  clearing member concerned as at 31 december 2013 collateral amounting to 461335 million
  had been provided for the benefit of eurex clearing ag this collateral balanced the risk of a clearing
  members default amounting to 348404 million

              after this the relevant clearing members contribution to the clearing fund would be used to cover the
               open amount the contributions made range from 1 million to 92 million
              any remaining shortfall would initially be covered by a contribution to the clearing fund by eurex clear


               ing ag eurex clearing ags contribution amounted to 500 million as at 31 december 2013
              only then would the other clearing members contributions to the clearing funds be used proportion

               ately as at 31 december 2013 the volume of eurex clearing ags clearing fund stood at 15972 mil
               lion after increasing the provision for the clearing fund it amounted to 26713 million as at
               31 january 2014 after the contributions have been used in full eurex clearing ag can request addi
               tional contributions from each clearing member which can be up to twice as high as their original
               clearing fund contributions
              ultimately a letter of comfort has been issued by deutsche börse ag in it deutsche börse ag states

               that it would provide eurex clearing ag with up to 700 million to cover any remaining losses the
               letter of comfort may only be used for losses from onexchange transactions
              finally in the case of a shortfall the remaining equity of eurex clearing ag would be used




             in the event of a counterparty default the default management process dmp is triggered its purpose
             is to assess the positions of the defaulting participant these are classified into recovery groups based
             on criteria such as joint saleability or their joint pricing in order to treat similar positions in a similar
             manner in the case of payment default each of these recovery groups is transferred to other participants
             via an auction when the dmp is initiated the clearing fund is also segmented according to the recovery
             groups based on the margin requirements if a clearing member defaults to recover the position first
             only the specific segment according to the liquidation groups of the clearing fund is used to bear the
             losses at the same time a committee of market experts default management committee meets to
             advise and support eurex clearing ag

             there have been three defaults of eurex clearing ags clearing members to date gontard  metallbank
             lehman brothers and mf global in all cases all outstanding positions could already be closed at the
             closing or cash settlement first line of defense in addition the majority of collateral could be trans
             ferred back to its owners

             deutsche börse group reduces its risk when investing funds belonging to group companies as well
             as client funds by distributing investments across multiple counterparties all with a high credit quality
             by defining investment limits for each counterparty as well as by primarily investing funds in the short
             term and in collateralised form if possible investment limits are established for each counterparty on the
             basis of regular credit checks and using ad hoc analyses as necessary

             stress tests are calculated for clearstream and eurex clearing ag to analyse scenarios such as the im
             pact if their largest client were to default the figures determined in this way are compared with the lim
             its defined as part of the riskbearing capacity in addition the impact of several clearing counterparties
             defaulting at the same time is calculated for eurex clearing ag a special stress test examines clear
             stream banking sas credit risk exposure from the settlement procedure with euroclear moreover in
             verse stress tests are calculated to determine the number of clients that would have to default for losses
             to exceed the risk cover amount the results can lead to further analyses and measures to reduce risk
             in the 2013 financial year no clearstream and eurex clearing ag as going concerns were identified in
             the course of the stress test calculations

generally deutsche börse group records various risk indicators in addition to the risk measures ec and
the earnings at risk and the stress tests performed that measure credit risk these include the extent to
which individual clients use their credit lines and credit concentrations

market price risk
market price risks result from operations in the case of interest rate or currency fluctuations deutsche
börse group measures these risks using earningsbased sensitivity analyses for extreme interest rate or
exchange rate fluctuations it avoids open currency positions whenever possible additional market price
risks can result from ringfenced plan assets within deutsche börse group contractual trust agreement
clearstream pension plan in luxembourg the group increased the proportion of fixedincome securities
in its portfolio in 2013 in order to further reduce market price risk the probability of significant market
price risk is low and the group also considers the impact to be low clearstream and eurex clearing ag
perform regulatory stress tests on the market price risk however since these market price risks are not
substantial no further stress tests are performed beyond those prescribed by the regulators

liquidity risk
liquidity risk applies if a deutsche börse group company is unable to meet its daily payment obligations
or only in return for increased refinancing costs operational liquidity requirements are met primarily by
internal financing by retaining funds generated the aim is to retain liquidity in the amount of operating
costs for one quarter target liquidity currently ranges from 150 to 250 million a group cash pool
also exists which pools excess liquidity to the extent that this is permissible from a regulatory and legal
perspective liquid funds are invested exclusively in the short term in order to ensure that they are
available shortterm investments are also largely secured by liquid bonds from firstclass issuers
deutsche börse ag has access to shortterm external sources of financing such as agreed credit lines
with individual banks or consortia and a commercial paper programme in order to cover its structural
financing needs deutsche börse ag has used its access to the capital market to issue corporate bonds
in recent years

clearstreams investment strategy aims to be able to repay customer deposits at all times accordingly
liquidity limits are set carefully in addition extensive sources of financing are available at all times such
as ongoing access to the liquidity facilities at deutsche bundesbank and banque centrale du luxem
bourg clearstream had sufficient liquidity throughout 2013

due to its role as a central counterparty eurex clearing ag has strict internal liquidity guidelines its
investment policy is correspondingly conservative regular analyses ensure the appropriateness of the
liquidity guidelines since extending its licence as an investment and credit institution under the kredit
wesengesetz kwg german banking act eurex clearing ag can use deutsche bundesbanks perma
nent facilities

the key liquidity risk for deutsche börse group lies in customer default if a clearing member of eurex
clearing ag defaults its member position is liquidated if a clearstream client defaults the  generally
collateralised and intraday  credit line granted to increase settlement efficiency would be called and the
collateral provided by the client could then be liquidated deutsche börse group estimates the probabil
ity of this risk to be low with the possibility of medium financial losses however in this context the key
risk lies not in financial losses but in the danger that the group may not be able to meet its obligations

164   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             the liquidity risk to which clearstream and eurex clearing ag are exposed is subject to regular stress
             tests both the sources of liquidity and its use are tested based on defined historic and hypothetical
             scenarios in addition inverse stress tests are performed to see which additional scenarios would have
             to occur for liquidity to be insufficient clearstream and eurex clearing ag had sufficient liquidity in the
             stress tests at all times in 2013

             business risk
             business risk reflects the fact that the group depends on macroeconomic developments and is influ
             enced by other external events such as changes in the competitive environment or regulatory initiatives
             it therefore expresses the groups business environment and sector risk it also includes business strate
             gy risk ie the impact of risks on the business strategy and possible adjustments to it these business
             risks are represented as target actual comparisons for ebit and are monitored constantly by the divi
             sions their total weighting for the group is of about 29 per cent business risks may result in revenues
             tagging budget projections or in costs being higher

             competitive environment
             business risk includes the risk that us competitors such as the cme and intercontinentalexchange ice
             derivatives exchanges or the nasdaq omx stock exchange might increase their presence on the europe
             an trading markets both on and offexchange deutsche börse group classes such market entry to be
             highly probable but considers its impact to be relatively low

             aggravated financial and debt crisis
             if a peripheral state were to leave the european currency union or if a state were to become insolvent
             this could mean that government bonds would not be redeemed or only would redeemed be in part
             the group currently views the probability of this risk occurring as low and the possible consequences
             as low a reduction in client trading activity and a related reduction in revenue from the trading business
             represent a continued risk for the groupthe group now considers the probability of this risk occurring
             to be low

             deutsche börse group simulates different scenarios in stress tests the scenarios simulate the simulta
             neous occurrence of different business risks such as the negative effects of stronger competition along
             side reduced business due to new regulations

             new regulatory requirements
             the risk arising from new regulatory requirements could significantly reduce trading volumes in the cash
             and derivatives markets this means that the planned revision of the markets in financial instruments
             directive mifid ii and the markets in financial instruments regulation mifir could increase the
             groups business risks facilitating access to european trading centres and clearing houses could lead
             to a greater competition and have a negative effect on revenue in the eurex and xetra segments

             in response to numerous possible manipulations of interest rates such as the interbank interest rate
             libor or the reference interest rate isdafix the eu is planning a regulation on indices used as bench
             marks in financial instruments and financial contracts the market changes resulting from this could
             negatively impact the revenue of the market data  services segment as well as the eurex marketplace

the introduction of a financial transaction tax which is supported by eleven european states could
significantly reduce trading activities for both eurex and xetra this would go hand in hand with
lower revenue not only for the marketplaces but also for all posttrading businesses and hence for
the entire group

deutsche börse group assumes a medium probability of occurrence for risks from new regulatory
requirements the possible financial consequences of these risks are currently classed as medium

project risk
project risks can result from the implementation of ongoing projects such as the launch of new products
processes or systems which could have a material impact on one or more of the three other risk cate
gories operational financial and business risk project risks are not broken down further it is evaluated
by the grm and already considered in the initial phase of substantial projects

for example the implementation of the target2securities settlement system is currently an important
project for clearstream clear is another key deutsche börse group project its goal is to develop an
even more powerful platform for eurex clearing ags clearing system

ongoing monitoring and controls ensure that project risks are continually analysed and evaluated ulti
mately project risks figure as operational financial and business riskswhich is why they are quantified
within these risk types



overall assessment by the executive board

deutsche börse ags executive board is responsible for risk management throughout the group and reg
ularly reviews the entire groups risk situation its summary of the situation in 2013 is given here along
with a final brief look at the coming financial year

summary
the past financial year saw additional external risk factors emerge for deutsche börse groups busi
ness the group identified these factors early on and took appropriate countermeasures due to these
measures deutsche börse groups risk profile remained stable however due to the settlement pay
ment to ofac deutsche börse group suffered from the largest loss event in its history in the year
under review deutsche börse groups risks were always covered by sufficient riskbearing capacity
as at 31 december 2013 the ec of deutsche börse group was 1630 million this was up by about
onetenth compared to the previous year 31 december 2012 1451 million available risk coverage

             basically remained constant over the same period at 2395 million 31 december 2012 2407 mil
             lion the earnings at risk as at 31 december 2013 were 589 million while risk appetite 840 million
             which compares with adjusted ebit in 2013 the increase in ec is primarily due to the increase in
             deutsche börse groups operational risk in particular legal and regulatory risks however business
             risks in the groups core markets tended to decline as the macroeconomic dangers tended to decrease

             the executive board of deutsche börse ag is convinced that the risk management system is effective
             the board strengthened the system in 2013 and reorganised the business area responsible for it the
             groupwide strategy to capture and minimise risks which now focuses more strongly on risk appetite
             forms the basis for internal risk management it is codified in the three principles described in this report

             outlook
             the group continuously assesses its risk situation based on stress tests the calculated ec as well as
             the risk management system the executive board of deutsche börse ag concludes that the available
             riskbearing capacitiy is sufficient furthermore it cannot identify any risk that could endanger the
             groups existence as a going concern in addition the allocated risk appetite limits were observed

             in 2014 the group intends to further strengthen its groupwide risk management for instance it
             plans to extend the default management process currently in place for eurex clearing ag not only to
             clearstream but to the entire group this will result in a consistent process for the groups financial
             institutions and take into account the potential reciprocal effects of a counterparty default

             moreover reciprocal effects across the entire group are to be analysed even better by expanding group
             wide stress tests so as to permit early identification of substantial risks or even risks endangering the
             groups existence as a going concern based on the recovery plans for clearstream and eurex clearing
             ag that have already been developed a groupwide recovery plan will be prepared in 2014 possible
             recovery scenarios which have so far been viewed in isolation can then also be analysed at group level
             and effective countermeasures can be developed in addition methods to measure and manage opera
             tional and credit risks are to be refined groupwide



             report on opportunities

             organisation of opportunities management

             deutsche börse groups management of opportunities aims to identify evaluate and assess opportu
             nities as early as possible and to take appropriate measures in order to transform opportunities into
             business success

             deutsche börse group evaluates organic growth opportunities both on an ongoing basis over the year
             in the individual business areas and systematically at group level as part of its annual budget plan
             ning process suggestions from the groups business areas for new products services or technologies
             serve as the starting point the process begins with a careful analysis of the market environment as

well as customer wishes it also considers factors such as market developments competitors and regula
tory changes this draws on a range of opportunity development tools such as a strengths and weak
nesses analyses or insideout and outsidein approaches

the ideas for growth initiatives are fleshed out using uniform groupwide templates and subjected to
a profitability analysis qualitative aspects are documented in the form of a business plan and expenses
and revenues are projected in detail for several years the business plan includes information about the
product or service that is to be offered as well as about target customers and competitors market size
barriers to market entry and the positioning of the product or service on the market it also outlines the
resources required and the implementation approach  including a marketingsales strategy  and high
lights potential risks the profitability analysis is based on absorption costing a distinction is made
between expense and expenditurerelated variables thus indicating the effect on both the companys
income statement and its cash flow statement

once the business plan and profitability analysis have been prepared for the individual growth initiatives
a decision is made as to their implementation this is made by the executive board of deutsche börse
ag as part of the annual budget planning process the executive board starts by setting the budget
available for growth initiatives which depends on general business performance this budget is then
allocated to the individual business areas on the basis of various factors such as a business areas con
tribution to group ebit the relevant growth initiatives within the business areas are then prioritised
prioritisation is based on the profitability analysis it also takes risks into account and assesses the
contribution of individual growth initiatives to the business areas and group strategy economies of
scope ie the benefits offered by a growth initiative to several business areas also play a role in the
prioritisation of growth initiatives the initiatives that make the highest value contribution and that can
be financed within the scope of the budget allocated to the business area are selected by the executive
board and incorporated into the budget

budgeting for growth initiatives involves reserving a fullyear budget in the form of expenditures and ex
penses for each selected growth initiative included in the investment portfolio the budget is approved
by the executive board of deutsche börse ag in the course of the year and is broken down into project
phases this ensures that funding approval is linked to project progress and that projects are reviewed
regularly it also gives the executive board the opportunity to adjust the deployment of the funds re
served for the year as a whole and to react to general business performance  if required new growth
initiatives can be approved and budgeted in the course of the year for example

monitoring of growth initiatives during the intraperiod budget approval process is facilitated by regular
reporting deutsche börse ags executive board receives a monthly report on the status and progress of
initiatives currently being implemented the report is coordinated by central functions in cooperation
with the individual projects from the business areas and compares planned costs and revenues with ac
tual budget utlilisation and the revenues actually generated in addition financial planning is adjusted
forecasts are updated and changes to the scope of the project are made transparent in addition checks
are used to establish whether milestones have been reached and projectspecific risks and the counter
measures taken are described project management and the supporting central functions comment on
the status of the project for the executive board

             organic growth opportunities

             in terms of organic growth opportunities deutsche börse group makes a basic distinction between
             structural and cyclical opportunities structural opportunities arise for example as a result of reg
             ulatory changes or new customer requirements and can be influenced directly by the company
             cyclical opportunities which are driven by macroeconomic changes cannot be influenced directly
             by the company

             structural growth opportunities
             deutsche börse group is currently focusing on structural growth opportunities relating to otc deriva
             tives clearing collateral and liquidity management and further expansion in asia

             clearing of otc derivatives eurex
             the liquidity problems experienced by major market participants during the financial crisis were triggered
             by the nonsettlement of bilateral overthecounter otc transactions that were entered into on an un
             secured basis in light of this the leading industrialised nations g20 agreed to create an effective regu
             latory environment to make offexchange derivatives transactions more transparent and more secure in
             response the european union has developed the european market infrastructure regulation emir
             which is aimed at regulating otc trading with derivatives emir includes the following regulatory re
             quirements

              an obligation to clear standardised otc derivatives transactions using a central counterparty
              special risk management requirements for transactions in nonstandardised derivatives
              an obligation to report the transactions to a trade repository




             emir entered into force on 16 august 2012 and is currently being implemented to help market par
             ticipants meet its requirements eurex clearing has developed a central counterparty for clearing otc
             derivatives transactions this is known as eurexotc clear and has been available to the market
             since 13 november 2012 this offering which may later be extended to other asset classes is aimed
             primarily at institutional customers and their interest rate derivatives transactions interest rate swaps
             it focuses in particular on security and efficiency allowing customers to gain the full benefit of eurex
             clearings risk and collateral management services for their otc transactions as well by the end of
             2013 a total of 32 clearing participants and over 120 institutional investors had registered for the
             offering several delays in drafting and implementing the emir regulation have also delayed the effec
             tive date of the clearing obligation at the time of publication of this management report the company
             expects it to enter into force at the end of 2014 or at the beginning of 2015

             collateral and liquidity management clearstream
             the collateral and liquidity management offering developed as part of the global liquidity hub growth
             initiative enables clearstream to help its customers cope with the structural changes they are facing
             such as those resulting from the additional liquidity requirements under basel iii and the new clearing
             obligations under emir the global liquidity hub allows banks to use the assets that clearstream holds
             in custody on their behalf more efficiently across different platforms and countries since this is a key
             issue worldwide clearstream markets its collateral management system to third parties and has entered
             into corresponding outsourcing agreements with various market infrastructure operators around the world

this service  the liquidity hub go global outsourcing  is at different stages of development with
clearstreams international partners in addition to central securities depositories clearstream has also
signed agreements with custodian banks to allow them to benefit from clearstreams collateral manage
ment expertise by the end of 2013 four central securities depositories csds  from brazil australia
spain and south africa  had been connected to the liquidity hub go moreover letters of intent have
been signed with other exchanges and csds among others in singapore and canada in addition to
csds and exchanges several custodian banks such as bnp paribas standard chartered and citibank
are also in the process of being connected

expansion in asia
in addition to growth in otc and unsecured markets the group is focusing on expanding its business in
growth regions a particular emphasis is on asia where the group is already successfully represented by
clearstream subsidiaries in particular among other things clearstream has operated a permanent estab
lishment in singapore since 2009 which has its own banking licence the company expects further
growth in asia in areas such as collateral and liquidity management the group has already achieved in
itial successes in this area by connecting the australian stock exchange to the global liquidity hub and
by signing an agreement with the singapore exchange sgx

after successfully positioning clearstream in asia it is the groups declared aim to clearly increase the
proportion of asian products and customers in other business areas as well in the medium term in the
eurex segment the focus to date has been on product alliances and on connecting participants to the
global network one example is the successful partnership eurex entered into with the korea exchange
krx products based on koreas benchmark kospi index have been traded on eurex since 2010 the
cooperation agreement entered into with taifex the taiwan futures exchange in 2013 follows this ex
ample what is more eurex acquired a 5 per cent interest in taifex in order to strengthen this strategic
product partnership through its subsidiary eex deutsche börse group acquired a majority interest in
cleartrade a singaporebased futures exchange at the beginning of 2014 the group also plans the
setup of a local clearing infrastructure for the derivatives area in order to support the growth within
the asian region asia also offers growth opportunities for the market data  services segment  for
example the bombay stock exchange bse has used deutsche börse groups derivatives trading tech
nology since the end of 2013 in addition the group has systematically expanded its offering of indices
on asian underlyings such as the stoxx china total market indices and won further customers for
its broad range of index products

market data and it
the group is also planning further growth by selling capital market data and solutions the aim is to
give stoxx which is already established as an index provider in europe a more global reach so that
other indices can be developed and marketed worldwide alongside the dax and stoxx index families
diversifying the range of indices aims to tap into new customer groups both within europe and in asia
and america for example in 2013 stoxx expanded its offering for chinese investors firstly by launch
ing new indices such as the stoxx china a 50 equal weight index and secondly by entering into a
licence agreement with a chinese issuer which will allow investors in china to also invest in the euro
stoxx 50 in addition the group is planning to increase external marketing of its internally developed

             revenue is expected in 2017

             other structural growth opportunities
             in addition to these initiatives the group has identified a number of other structural factors that should
             have a positive impact on business success

              in january 2014 agreement was reached at a european level on the mifid ii directive among other
               things otc derivatives transactions will in future have to be settled via organised trading facilities a
               requirement that is expected to benefit eurex in addition it was resolved to limit the volume of equi
               ties traded in dark pools the group expects this restriction to have a positive impact on the volumes
               traded on xetra
              risk management is becoming more important as a consequence of the financial crisis the company

               expects market participants to make greater use of eurex clearings clearing services to net out trans
               actions in different asset classes and hence to eliminate counterparty risk
              as a result of the european legal and administrative framework relating to certain undertakings for

               collective investment in transferable securities ucits iii the company expects that traditional invest
               ment funds will increasingly include derivatives in their portfolio strategies this could result in addi
               tional business for the eurex segment
              for clearstreams posttrade activities the company anticipates that in the long term companies will


               increasingly raise capital through equity and debt financing on the capital markets this is related to
               the higher capital and liquidity requirements for banks and the resulting negative impact on the total
               volume of available credit for clearstream this could have a positive effect on custody volumes espe
               cially in the international bond segment in addition given the growing internationalisation of the capi
               tal markets the company is continuing to expect a sharper rise in the volume issued internationally

cyclical opportunities
in addition to structural growth opportunities deutsche börse group has cyclical opportunities for
example as a result of positive macroeconomic development although the company cannot influence
these directly they could lift deutsche börse groups net revenue and consolidated net income signifi
cantly in the medium term

 in the cash and derivatives market segments xetra and eurex sustained positive economic develop
  ment an improvement in the situation of the southern eu member states a lasting rise in investor
  confidence in the capital markets and as a result a renewed rise in risk appetite among market partici
  pants as well as greater stock market volatility could stimulate trading activity by market participants
  and boost trading volumes
 the volumes of interest rate derivatives traded on the groups derivatives markets could rise as a result


  of increasing speculation about trends in longterm interest rates for german and other european gov
  ernment bonds if key interest rates actually rise and if the spread between the various european
  government bonds continues to narrow
 in the posttrade segment clearstream a reduction in the liquidity supplied by the central banks could


  encourage bond issuance and lead to an increase in custody volumes moreover this could increase
  demand for clearstreams range of collateral and liquidity management services net interest income
  from banking would benefit from a rise in shortterm interest rates in the euro zone and the usa
 in the market data business an increase in the number of employees at companies active on the

  financial markets could lead to growing demand for data packages



external growth opportunities

in addition the company regularly explores external growth opportunities which are subjected to the
same kind of stringent analysis as its organic growth initiatives for this reason only a small number of
the opportunities analysed are ultimately realised examples of external growth in the past few years in
clude the acquisition of all the shares of eurex from six group ag and of a majority interest in the euro
pean energy exchange as well as the increased stake in the index provider stoxx ltd deutsche börse
group is also open to alliances and equity investments in asia  examples can be found in the eurex
segment and clearstream segment sections in general however given that the company already
offers a very comprehensive range of products and services along the entire value chain its focus is
squarely on leveraging organic growth opportunities

             development of the operating environment

             deutsche börse group anticipates that the economy will grow moderately worldwide during the forecast
             period in the case of the emerging markets the group expects that countries with a current account
             surplus will continue to expand at an aboveaverage rate and that the exchange rate turbulence observed
             in some emerging markets at the beginning of 2014 will not escalate into a serious crisis moreover
             the group expects that economic growth in the industrialised nations will also pick up again following
             a number of difficult years in the wake of the financial crisis with respect to europe the group is fore
             casting that the economic situation will improve on the back of the clear increase in growth expected for
             germany in particular in view of this essentially positive situation the company expects market partici
             pants to regain confidence in the capital markets however currently uncertain factors such as the credit
             quality and liquidity of individual euro zone states the budgetary situation in the usa the monetary pol
             icy adopted by the central bank or a crisis in confidence in the currencies of certain emerging market
             countries could unsettle the markets again as regards interest rate trends the group does not expect
             to see any fundamental departure from the current low interest rate policy in europe whereas a trend
             reversal might occur in the usa already in 2014

             in its forecast of economic development for 2014 published in january 2014 the international mone
             tary fund imf predicts an increase of around 10 per cent in the euro zone and growth of around
             16 per cent in germany the difference between the euro zone and germany is a result of only slight
             growth in countries such as france italy and spain expectations for the united kingdom and the
             united states are significantly higher than for the euro zone in 2014 the economy is forecast to grow
             by around 24 per cent in the uk and by around 28 per cent in the us the highest growth by far
             in 2014  approximately 7 per cent  is again expected in asian countries and especially china in
             anticipation of high domestic demand given the extremely varied estimates for the different economic
             regions global economic growth is projected to be around 37 per cent in 2014

             governments and central banks are currently working on strengthening regulation of the financial
             markets to further stabilise the financial sector and prevent future crises of this degree of severity the
             measures envisioned and in some cases already initiated range from revising the legal framework
             for banking business and capital requirements to improving financial market supervision for more in
             formation please see the regulatory environment section of this report on expected developments
             for deutsche börse groups customers the impact of these farreaching regulatory reform projects on
             market structures and business models is difficult to gauge accurately at present deutsche börse antici
             pates that this uncertainty will continue to weigh on the business activities of market participants
             during the forecast period for the group itself the different regulatory projects will have both positive
             and negative consequences overall however the company sees the changing regulatory environment
             as an opportunity to expand its business further see the report on opportunities for further details



             regulatory environment

             introduction
             one consequence of the global financial market crisis is that work is now underway at an international
             level on regulatory initiatives in a wide variety of areas with the aim of creating a more transparent
             more stable and fair financial system in line with the g20s objectives the main focus is on regulation
             of the supervisory structure recovery and resolution plans new regulations for the financial market

infrastructure and for banks and the settlement of securities derivatives and other financial instruments
the latter initiatives have been integrated into the regulatory projects for financial market infrastructures
eg restrictions on highfrequency trading or a central clearing obligation for derivatives and are only
supplemented by separate regulatory projects in selected areas eg the revision of european securities
law legislation

regulation of supervisory structures
supervisory structures have changed as a result of tighter regulation the european supervisory authori
ties created on 1 january 2011  esma european securities markets authority eba european bank
ing authority and eiopa european insurance and occupational pensions authority  as well as the
european systemic risk board now play a much more significant role while the scope for decisions at
national level has declined

the goal is to further harmonise the supervisory practices in the eu in future and to structure them as
a banking union in the first step supervision over the approximately 130 largest banks with inter
national operations will be transferred directly to the european central bank ecb in november 2014
single supervisory mechanism ssm the eu adopted the ssm regulation on 15 october 2013
under the ssm the ecb will assume responsibility in principle for banking supervision in the euro
zone states outside the euro zone have the option to join the supervisory mechanism however the
ecb will only lay down supervisory principles harmonise interpretation decisions and coordinate the
national supervisory authorities in preparation for this the selected institutions will be subjected to
intensive quantitative analyses and stress tests as a basis for developing the appropriate supervision
strategy for the future clearstream banking sa meets the quantitative criteria and has been selected
for ecb supervision because of its key role in luxembourg thanks to its business model and fundamen
tally riskaverse business strategy it regards itself as well positioned for the upcoming ecb analyses and
the future supervisory regime

furthermore the recovery and resolution mechanism for banks in distress is to be harmonised and
a european fund financed by the banks is to be created single resolution mechanism srm on
10 july 2013 the european commission submitted a draft srm regulation the legislative process is at
an advanced stage and the regulation is currently expected to be adopted by the middle of 2014 the
srm is set to enter into force on 1 january 2015 and will cover all countries participating in the ssm

the third measure making up the banking union is common deposit protection the european commis
sion submitted a proposal for this in july 2013 the legislative process is expected to be completed by
the middle of 2014

recovery and resolution plans
banks
in october 2011 the financial stability board fsb adopted the key attributes of effective resolution
regimes for financial institutions key attributes which are aimed at resolving systemically important
institutions in an orderly manner without loss to the public purse the heads of state and government
of the g20 countries have undertaken to implement the key attributes

174   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             at a european level the european commission published a proposal on 6 june 2012 for a directive of
             the european parliament and the european council defining a framework for the recovery and resolution
             of credit institutions and securities firms bank recovery and resolution directive brrd the directive
             is expected to incorporate material components of the key attributes and to be enacted in spring 2014

             in anticipation of the expected european regulation germany passed the gesetz zur abschirmung
             von risiken und zur planung der sanierung und abwicklung von kreditinstituten und finanzgruppen
             german act on ringfencing and recovery and resolution planning for credit institutions and financial
             groups on 7 august 2013 on the basis of this act clearstream banking ag and eurex clearing ag
             have been classified as a potential systemic risk

             financial market infrastructure providers
             provision is also being made for recovery and resolution plans for financial market infrastructure provid
             ers such as central securities depositories csds central counterparties central trade repositories and
             securities settlement services in this context back in july 2012 the committee on payment and settle
             ment systems cpss and the international organization of securities commissions iosco had jointly
             invited consultation on their initial thoughts which in turn complement the principles for financial
             market infrastructures pfmi published in april 2012 in august 2013 a revised and expanded ver
             sion was submitted to market participants however a draft legislative text is not yet available and is
             not expected before the middle of 2014

             at eu level the european commission in 2012 explained its thinking on a possible framework for the
             recovery and resolution of financial market infrastructures however given that the international debate
             is still ongoing the commission is not expected to release a draft text of the regulation before the middle

emir
the regulation by the european parliament and the european council on otc derivatives central coun
terparties and trade repositories entered into force in august 2012 among other things it mandates the
use of central counterparties ccps for settling a greater number of derivatives transactions in addition
it requires otc derivatives to be registered in trade repositories which are in turn monitored by esma

for deutsche börse group this provides an opportunity to expand its clearing offering to otc derivatives
see the     report on opportunities however the additional importance placed on central counterpar
ties in europe also entails increased capital requirements for ccps for eurex clearing ag deutsche
börse groups central counterparty the group expects an additional capital requirement of more than
100 million for this reason an amount of 110 million was appropriated to the reserves in january
2013 eurex clearing ag submitted its application for authorisation as a central counterparty on
1 august 2013 deutsche börse group expects the authorisation to be granted and consequently for
emir to apply to eurex clearing in practice in the second quarter of 2014 further gradual adjustments
to capital requirements may be made once the authorisation has been granted in addition to eurex
clearing ag the obligation to obtain authorisation also applies to european commodity clearing ag
the clearing company for eextraded products which will be consolidated with effect from 2014
registr sa one of four central trade repositories authorised by esma in november 2013 also
belongs to deutsche börse group

csd regulation
with the csd regulation the european commission aims to create a uniform european regulatory
framework for central securities depositories for the first time the commission submitted a proposal
for this in march 2012 and the measures are expected to be passed in the first quarter of 2014 it
is currently assumed that securities settlement systems and supervisory rules for central securities de
positories will be harmonised throughout europe this will strengthen clearstreams business model
because the provision of integrated banking services will still be permitted

other regulatory initiatives with an impact on financial market structures
other initiatives expected for 2014 are a revision of european securities law legislation sll as well
as the fifth revision of the directive on undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities
ucits and the implementation of the directive on alternative investment fund managers aifm in
germany it is not possible at present to gauge the impact on clearstreams business activities

banking regulations
the regulatory initiatives for banks currently focus on the basel iii regulations which have been imple
mented in the eu in combination with other rules as part of the crd iv package internationally the
basel iii regulations are already undergoing further development by the basel committee on banking
supervision bcbs furthermore a group of experts led by erkki liikanen governor of the bank of fin
land has prepared a report for the eu on necessary reforms of the banking sector that was published in
october 2012 liikanen report as a consequence work is currently under way on the limited intro
duction of a separated banking system

basel iiicrd iv
in particular basel iii includes a revised definition of capital additional risk buffers for expected losses
the introduction of anticyclical capital buffers the introduction of a leverage ratio put simply a mini
mum ratio of capital to unweighted total assets plus offbalance sheet risk positions stricter liquidity
management requirements and closer monitoring of liquidity positions by supervisory authorities in par
ticular the introduction of two quantitative minimum ratios for shortterm and mediumterm liquidity

176   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             the regulatory framework is planned to be introduced in several stages in the period up to 2019 during
             the transition process certain subareas which have been developed successively since 2012 and in
             some cases have already been completed will be reviewed and if necessary modified the basel iii
             package also comprises a general revision of the capitalisation requirements for exposures to central
             counterparties

             in the eu the basel iii regulations together with other issues such as corporate governance topics and
             the implementation of a single rule book were incorporated in a revised regulatory framework for banks
             and securities service providers to achieve this the eu directives 200648ec banking directive and
             200649ec capital adequacy directive  referred to collectively up to now as the capital require
             ments directives  were completely revised and restructured to produce an integrated legislative package
             commonly referred to as crd iv consisting of directive 201336eu which has to be implemented
             in national law and regulation eu no 5752013 capital requirement regulation crr which
             applies directly

             the directive and regulation forming part of the crd iv package were adopted on 26 june 2013
             meanwhile the eba has produced a number of level 2 implementing measures eba technical stand
             ards although they have not yet been put into force by the eu the eu legislation has incorporated a
             number of the basel amendments and additions that the bcbs had published by the middle of the sec
             ond quarter of 2013 the aim is to transpose further amendments arising from the basel process into
             eu law without delay via level 2 texts review clauses or commissiondelegated legal acts the crd iv
             directive and the options exercised under the crr were implemented in germany by way of the crd iv
             umsetzungsgesetz act implementing crd iv of 3 september 2013 as well as by a number of regula
             tions published in the second half of december 2013 in anticipation of the final eu texts luxembourg
             issued a circular by the cssf commission du secteur financier covering individual aspects in 2012
             however the final implementation of crd iv and of the national options under the crr had not been
             resolved as at the beginning of 2014

             whereas the basel iii rules only apply directly to global commercial banks with an international remit
             the eu rules apply to all banks that operate in the eu crd iv therefore partly addresses both regional
             and sizerelated issues and provides for specific or modified regulations for certain types of business
             with regard to systemic risk the european regulations go beyond the scope of basel iii moreover spe
             cific rules have been included for corporate governance and in particular for remuneration which are
             not found in the basel framework finally the largeexposure rules have been gradually harmonised at
             eu level although comparable rules have to date not been harmonised internationally the bcbs pre
             sented a consultation paper in 2013 on the introduction of internationally harmonised largeexposure
             rules concentration risk which is planned for 2015 the final regulatory framework is expected at the
             beginning of 2014

             taking into account various interim rules the basel iii regulations have in principle been in force inter
             nationally since 1 january 2013 in the eu they were only implemented via the crd iv package as at
             1 january 2014

             from deutsche börse groups perspective the provisions will not have any material effect on the equity
             base of its regulated companies in the short term since the companies belonging to deutsche börse
             group already have comprehensive internally specified buffers the additional capital requirements
             resulting from the phased introduction of new capital buffers are expected to be relatively moderate
             in addition these requirements will be influenced by other factors such as business developments
             operational risk coverage recovery plan requirements and possibly also the future csd regulation

                                                                                report on expected developments




independent of the regulatory requirements the group will continuously analyse the capitalisation of its
regulated entities  including interactions with the requirements for the central counterparties under
emir  and will adjust it as necessary to improve risk coverage the regulated companies belonging to
deutsche börse group have been designated as other systemically important banks by the german and
luxembourg supervisory authorities here too the group does not expect any increase in capital to be
required in the short term as a result of this designation since many detailed questions are still unre
solved the impact on the groups business activities cannot be assessed conclusively at the present time

basel developments
the bcbs launched a number of measures to update the basel framework basel iii which was essen
tially completed in 2010 and finalised some of them in 2013 or at the beginning of 2014 the main
changes relate to the following aspects adjustments to the liquidity rules finetuning of the require
ments for the shortterm liquidity coverage ratio supplementary control parameters and the introduction
of management instruments for intraday liquidity details of the disclosure of liquidity coverage and lev
erage ratios treatment of investments in investment funds and additions or updates to the methodology
used to identify globally systemically important banks the bcbs is currently also discussing further
finetuning or fundamental revisions of individual aspects of the basel regulatory framework including
rules on allocating items to the trading or banking book changes to the treatment of securitisations the
development of a supplementary method for calculating counterparty risk capital requirements for deriv
atives adjustments to the capital requirements for exposures to central counterparties the introduction
of international rules to limit concentration risk largeexposure rules and finetuning of the net stable
funding ratio structural liquidity ratio furthermore a fundamental revision of the counterparty risk ex
posure to countries is planned above and beyond the basel iii framework the bcbs has published
rules for the collateralisation of derivatives not settled via central counterparties

separated banking system
based on the recommendations of the liikanen report the introduction of a separated banking system
is currently being discussed at eu level the aim of such a system is to ringfence largescale proprietary
trading activities from the traditional deposit and lending business while there is only a draft regulation
governing this at european level germany has anticipated a european solution by passing a regulation
that will come into effect in stages from 2014 onwards the institutions belonging to deutsche börse
group are not directly affected by this move

financial transaction tax
in addition there are ongoing discussions within the european union about the introduction of a finan
cial transaction tax the introduction of such a tax would negatively impact deutsche börse groups
business development the extent of the impact would depend on which asset classes were affected
how the tax would be applied and what the tax rates would be it is not possible to predict the concrete
impact on the groups business from the current status of the discussions

deutsche börse groups involvement in regulatory initiatives
neutral market infrastructure providers such as deutsche börse group make a significant contribution
to increasing the transparency stability and fairness of the financial markets for this reason deutsche
börse group has been and will continue to be deeply involved in the abovementioned political and
regulatory initiatives right from the start the group participates actively in the consultations making

178   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             sure that political decisionmakers are aware of potential negative consequences for the market as a
             whole and the company affected in particular deutsche börse group also takes an appropriate stance
             on the abovementioned political initiatives in this way it counteracts excessive effects on the group
             or any of its subsidiaries and works to ensure that the interests of any affected business units are taken
             into account in an appropriate manner



             future development of results of operations

             given its diversified business model and multiple sources of revenue deutsche börse group continues
             to consider itself very well positioned and expects to see a positive trend in its results of operations in the
             long term this expectation is based on among other things the growth opportunities that the company
             intends to exploit in the medium to long term see the report on opportunities for further details for
             the forecast period however the uncertainty about the future behaviour of capital market participants
             continues to make specific forecasts of the results of operations difficult a recurrence of the disconnect
             already observed in 2012 and 2013 between the performance of the stock markets and the real econ
             omy and trading on the groups cash and derivatives markets which is linked to a loss of confidence
             among investors and market participants cannot be ruled out for the forecast period either the compa
             ny also expects continuing uncertainty among market participants about the future form of the regulatory
             projects this could have a dampening effect on the business activities of the groups customers in the
             forecast period

             as part of its budget planning process the company has therefore developed different possible scenarios
             for its results of operations in 2014 if the capital market environment and investor confidence fail to
             improve and the markets continue to be impacted by uncertainty regarding global economic performance
             and the future situation in the euro zone business activity would be roughly on a par with the previous
             year this would mean net revenue of approximately 19 billion for 2014 should the capital market
             environment investor confidence and the situation in the southern eu member states improve signifi
             cantly in 2014 the company would expect net revenue to increase yearonyear to around 21 billion
             the scenario used to forecast net revenue is determined to a significant extent by the dominant short
             to mediumterm cyclical factors whose impact on business activity the company is unable to control
             the net revenue forecast includes consolidation effects of around 55 million from the consolidation
             of börse frankfurt zertifikate ag as at 1 july 2013 and of european energy exchange eex as at
             1 january 2014 with regard to net interest income from banking business which is a component
             of net revenue the company does not anticipate any fundamental change in interest rate policies in
             europe and the usa

             if contrary to expectations general conditions turn out to be worse than as described above or if they
             impact the companys customers to an even greater extent the company believes it is in a good position
             to continue to do business profitably due to its successful business model and its rigorous cost discipline

             the group will compensate for the expected inflationlinked cost increases after the forecast period
             thanks to the additional annual savings of 70 million from 2016 onwards that were resolved in 2013
             at the same time these provide the group with the freedom needed to continue its growth and infra
             structure initiatives which it intends to use to take advantage of opportunities presented by the struc
             tural and regulatory changes on the financial markets and to harness the potential offered by growth

                                                                                report on expected developments




markets such as asia the groups operating costs have been rising since 2011 primarily as a result of
the increased level of investments the company expects operating costs to continue to increase moder
ately in the forecast period and beyond for 2014 the company is budgeting for additional operating
costs of around 30 million primarily for the ongoing expansion of its collateral and liquidity manage
ment services and its expansion in asia in addition consolidation effects see above will affect operat
ing costs by around 50 million in total the company therefore expects operating costs of approxi
mately 1050 million in 2014 adjusted for special factors such as efficiency programmes as at the
publication date of this combined management report the company is expecting that operating costs will
be affected by special factors of some 20 million especially relating to costs for efficiency measures

because of the slight rise in operating costs the stable net revenue scenario would generate ebit of
around 850 million adjusted for special factors in the scenario with a rise in net revenue adjusted
ebit would be approximately 1050 million

the group anticipates an unchanged tax rate of approximately 26 per cent for the forecast period
adjusted for any special factors

consolidated net income for the period would amount to around 600 million in the stable net revenue
scenario and to around 750 million in the rising net revenue scenario adjusted for special factors
in both cases the refinancing of longterm financial liabilities which was completed in 2013 will
positively impact consolidated net income because it has led to a significant reduction in the groups
interest expense

the parent company deutsche börse ag has also considered the scenarios described above in its
planning for fullyear 2014 the company expects net revenue of between 11 and 12 billion
and net income of 05 to 06 billion adjusted for special factors in both scenarios

eurex segment
in the past year the cyclical factors see the results of operations section for details led to a de
crease in derivatives trading volumes however deutsche börse group still believes that structural
growth factors will remain dominant over the long term and that they will positively influence trading
volumes in all product segments see the       report on opportunities for further details

eurex will again step up investments to enhance its technology and its product offering in the forecast
period the investment focus is on expanding risk management for example the segment is planning a
further expansion of its portfoliobased risk management activities and of the functions used to segregate
customer positions among other things these new features are being implemented so as to offer an ex
panded range of clearing services for otc derivatives trading in future in the medium to long term the
company expects this initiative to deliver significant additional net revenue since the regulatory require
ments to settle otc derivatives transactions via a central counterparty will probably not finally enter into
force until the end of 2014 or 2015 the group does not anticipate any material additional contribution
to net revenue for 2014 with respect to cyclical business drivers in the eurex segment two factors
could have a positive impact on business activity 1 an increase in stock market volatility because this
has a major influence on trading in index derivatives and 2 increasing speculation about possible
changes in interest rate policies by the central banks

180   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             xetra segment
             as in the past net revenue in the xetra cash market segment will continue to depend on equity mar
             ket trends and equity market volatility in the future but also on structural and cyclical changes in
             trading activity 2013 saw a significant level of caution on the part of market participants as in the
             previous year sustainable growth would require a further improvement in investor confidence how
             ever there were only tentative signs of this at the time this management report was prepared

             in addition to enhancing its cash market the company will continue to maintain a close watch on
             changes in the competitive environment for the european cash markets as in the past it considers it
             self well positioned to retain its status as the market leader for trading german blue chips and to offer
             its customers across the globe an attractive range of products and services for cash trading in german
             and european equities as well as equities clearing however due to the stronger competition in the
             cash market further shifts in the market shares of all competitors cannot be ruled out

             clearstream segment
             the clearstream segment generates its net revenue primarily from the settlement and custody of interna
             tional bonds  a business that is much more stable and less subject to fluctuations on the capital mar
             kets than the trading business in light of regulatory requirements and the loss of confidence among
             market participants the group anticipates a structurally driven increase in demand for collateral and
             liquidity management services for this reason clearstream is systematically expanding its international
             global liquidity hub offering following on the four central securities depositories that had already con
             nected to the global liquidity hub by the end of 2013 further connections are planned for the forecast
             period in the medium to long term the company expects this initiative to deliver significant additional
             net revenue however since the new partners can only be connected consecutively only a small addi
             tional contribution to net revenue is anticipated for 2014 the monetary policy pursued by central banks
             in the forecast period will also have an impact on clearstreams business if monetary policy becomes
             more restrictive this would have positive consequences for securities issuance the use of collateral and
             liquidity management services and net interest income in the banking business furthermore during
             the forecast period clearstream will make preparations for target2securities t2s the european cen
             tral banks future central settlement platform in the medium to long term clearstream expects its attrac
             tive collateral and liquidity management and its strong position in the t2s network to result in increased
             business activity

             with regard to its customer structure the company continues to expect that consolidation in the financial
             sector will persist and that customers in clearstreams domestic and international business will merge
             these larger customers would benefit from greater discounts which would lead to a decline in average
             fees although deutsche börse faces especially intense competition in the areas of the settlement and
             custody of international bonds the company does not expect this to have a major impact on its net rev
             enue or to result in a loss of market share during the forecast period

             market data  services segment
             at the beginning of 2013 the information technology it and market data  analytics areas were
             combined in a separate reporting segment together with selected external it services the aim of the
             new segment is to accelerate the expansion of deutsche börses technology leadership and expertise in

                                                                                report on expected developments




the area of market data by pooling all the companys relevant resources in a dedicated marketdriven
business unit the goal is to open up untapped growth opportunities in the medium to long term under
uniform management and with separate profit and loss responsibility

in spite of the persistently difficult environment the company anticipates a slight increase in net revenue
in the market data  services segment during the forecast period this expectation is based on the con
tinuous expansion of the product range in all areas and greater marketing of these products in growth
regions

development of pricing models
deutsche börse anticipates sustained price pressure in some of its business areas during the forecast
period the companys objective is to mitigate this price pressure by continually improving its products
and services and offering selective incentives for priceelastic business

over the long term the average net revenue per unit concerned eg trading or clearing fees per trans
action fees for custody services is expected to decline slightly in all areas of the group this is a result
of the laddered pricing models that lead to a decline in income per unit as customers business activities
increase



development of nonfinancial performance indicators

initiatives to promote the transparency and security of the markets will be a focus during the forecast pe
riod ensuring deutsche börse groups value contribution to society to live up to this goal deutsche
börse will continue to expand its groupwide product and service offering in the area of market transpar
ency for example by adding indices developed and calculated by the group moreover the investments
in the trading and clearing infrastructure already made in 2013 as well as those planned for the forecast
period will ensure that the systems meet customer and market requirements against this background
the company anticipates that the availability of the different systems will be maintained at the very high
level of previous years throughout the forecast period

responsible management with a focus on longterm value creation is of considerable importance for
deutsche börse group as a service company in particular in view of demographic change and the
resulting shortage of specialist staff the company aims to continue to position itself adequately and
therefore intends to increase the number of women in management positions the appointment of
hauke stars means that the goal of having at least one female executive board member by 2015 was
already met in 2012



future development of the groups financial position

the company expects operating cash flow which is deutsche börse groups primary funding instru
ment to remain clearly positive in the forecast period with regard to liquidity the group expects two
significant factors to influence its development firstly the company plans to invest 150 million per
year in intangible assets and property plant and equipment during the forecast period on a consoli
dated basis the investments will be reported as cash flows from investing activities and will serve
primarily to develop new products and services in the eurex and clearstream segments and enhance

182   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             existing ones the total mainly comprises investments in the trading infrastructure and risk manage
             ment functionalities secondly the executive board and supervisory board of deutsche börse ag will
             propose to the annual general meeting to be held in may 2014 that a dividend of 210 per share
             should be paid this would correspond to a liquidity outflow of 3866 million apart from the above
             no further material factors were expected to impact on the groups liquidity at the time the manage
             ment report was prepared as in previous years the group does not expect any liquidity squeezes
             due to its positive cash flow adequate credit lines see note 36 to the consolidated financial state
             ments for details and flexible management and planning systems

             under its capital management programme deutsche börse will react flexibly to a changing market
             environment in the forecast period both the general target dividend distribution ratio of 40 to 60 per
             cent of consolidated net income for the year and any share buybacks in addition are subject to capi
             tal requirements investment needs and general liquidity considerations

             to maintain its strong credit ratings at group level the company aims to achieve a ratio of interest
             bearing gross debt to ebitda of no more than 15 for 2014 the group expects a ratio of 15 or
             slightly less to be reached depending on how net revenue develops

             the parent company deutsche börse ag plans to invest some 50 million in intangible assets and
             property plant and equipment during the forecast period



             overall assessment by the executive board

             the executive board of deutsche börse ag believes that thanks to its comprehensive offering along
             the securities trading value chain and its innovative power the company remains in a very good position
             compared with the international competition and expects to see a positive trend in its results of opera
             tions in the long term for the forecast period however the uncertainty about the behaviour of capital
             market participants in relation to economic and regulatory conditions makes it difficult for the executive
             board to make a specific forecast by taking the additional efficiency measures resolved in 2013 the
             executive board has prepared the company at an early stage for the changing market and will be able
             to compensate for the expected inflationlinked cost increases above and beyond the forecast period
             at the same time this means the executive board has provided the flexibility needed to continue the
             groups growth and infrastructure investments which it intends to use to take advantage of opportunities
             presented by the structural and regulatory changes on the financial markets and to harness the potential
             offered by growth markets such as asia primarily as a result of the increased level of investments the
             executive board expects operating costs after adjustments to increase moderately in the forecast period
             and beyond overall the executive board anticipates on this basis that cash flow from operating activi
             ties will be clearly positive and that as in previous years there will be no liquidity squeezes the overall
             assessment by the executive board is valid as of the time of publication of this combined management

amendments to ifrs 9 financial instruments october 2010
the amendments extend ifrs 9 financial instruments to include rules on accounting for financial
liabilities if the fair value option is applied to financial liabilities revisions to the recognition of changes

in other comprehensive income rather than in profit or loss the original effective date was removed
from the current version of the standard application is permitted if the rules on accounting for financial
assets are also applied the standard has not been adopted by the eu yet

amendments to ifrs 9 and ifrs 7  mandatory effective date and transition disclosures in
the notes december 2011

ifrs 9 financial instruments and ifrs 7 financial instruments disclosures this also had the effect
of postponing the requirement to apply the amended ifrs 9 for financial years beginning on or after
1 january 2015 the removal of the effective date from ifrs 9 as most recently amended in november
2013 means that the amendments to ifrs 7 can also be delayed until ifrs 9 is adopted

             in which ifrs 9 is adopted the changes in carrying amounts resulting from the transition to ifrs 9
             unless they relate to measurement effects at the time of transition as well as the changes in carrying
             amounts attributable to such effects in addition it must be possible on the basis of the information
             disclosed to reconcile the measurement categories according to ias 39 and ifrs 9 to individual line
             items in the financial statements or classes of financial instruments the amendments to the two stan

             chapter 6 in addition the iasb allows early adoption of the requirement to recognise the changes in
             fair value attributable to changes in the entitys own credit risk in other comprehensive income if the
             changes in fair value are reported in the income statement the november 2013 amendment removed
             the original effective date of ifrs 9

             ance has been provided for clarification in this guidance the iasb emphasises firstly that an uncondi
             tional legally enforceable right of offsetting must exist even if one of the parties involved is insolvent
             secondly it lists illustrative criteria under which gross settlement of a financial asset and a finan
             cial liability nevertheless leads to offsetting the additional guidance is effective retrospectively for fi
             nancial years beginning on or after 1 january 2014 the amendments have been adopted by the eu

intangible assets

capitalised development costs are amortised from the date of first use of a software using the straight
line method over its expected useful life the useful life of internally developed software is generally
assumed to be five years a useful life of seven years is used as the basis in the case of newly developed
trading platforms and clearing systems

purchased software is carried at cost and reduced by systematic amortisation and where necessary
impairment losses amortisation is charged using the straightline method over the expected useful life
or at most until the right of use has expired

intangible assets are derecognised on disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected to
flow from them

the amortisation period for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at least at the end of
each financial year if the expected useful life of an asset differs from previous estimates the amortisa
tion period is adjusted accordingly

goodwill is recognised at cost and tested at least once a year for impairment

the cost of the other intangible assets acquired in the course of business combinations corresponds to
the fair value as at the acquisition date assets with a finite useful life are amortised using the straight
line method over the expected useful life assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment
at least once a year

carrying amount is compared with the recoverable amount the higher of value in use and fair value
less costs of disposal to determine the amount of any potential impairment

the value in use is estimated on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash flows from continu
ing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal before taxes for this purpose discount rates are esti
mated based on the prevailing pretax weighted average cost of capital if no recoverable amount can
be determined for an asset it is allocated to a cashgenerating unit for which the recoverable amount
is calculated

irrespective of any indications of impairment intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible
assets not yet available for use must be tested for impairment annually at least impairment tests are
performed where there are indications of impairment if the estimated recoverable amount is lower than
the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognised and the net book value of the asset is reduced
to its estimated recoverable amount

goodwill is allocated to identifiable groups of assets cashgenerating units or groups of cashgenerating
units that create synergies from the respective acquisition this corresponds to the lowest level at which
deutsche börse group monitors goodwill an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of the
cashgenerating unit to which goodwill is allocated including the carrying amount of this goodwill is
higher than the recoverable amount of this group of assets the impairment loss is first allocated to the
goodwill then to the other assets in proportion to their carrying amounts

a review is conducted at every balance sheet date to see whether there is any indication that an impair
ment loss recognised on noncurrent assets excluding goodwill in the previous years no longer applies
if this is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased and the difference is recognised in profit
or lossthe maximum amount of this reversal is limited to the carrying amount that would have resulted
if no impairment loss had been recognised in previous periods impairment losses on goodwill are not
reversed



financial investments

financial investments comprise investments in associates and financial assets

investments in associates consist of investments in joint ventures and other associates they are
measured at cost on initial recognition and accounted for using the equity method upon subsequent
measurement



financial assets finanzielle vermögenswerte

for deutsche börse group financial assets are in particular other equity investments receivables and
securities from banking business other financial instruments and other loans financial instruments of
eurex clearing ag receivables and other assets as well as bank balances

216   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             recognition of financial assets
             financial assets are recognised when a group company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of
             the instrument they are generally recognised at the trade date loans and receivables from banking
             business availableforsale financial assets from banking business as well as purchases and sales of
             equities via the central counterparty ie eurex clearing ag are recognised at the settlement date

             financial assets are initially measured at fair value in the case of a financial asset that is not measured
             at fair value through profit or loss in subsequent periods this includes transaction costs

             subsequent measurement of financial assets
             subsequent measurement of financial instruments follows the categories which are described below
             as in previous years deutsche börse group did not take advantage of the option to allocate financial
             assets to the heldtomaturity investments category in the year under review in addition the group
             waived the possibility to designate financial assets at fair value through profit and loss fair value
             option the financial assets are allocated to the respective categories at initial recognition

             assets held for trading
             derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments as well as financial instruments of eurex
             clearing ag see details below are measured at fair value through profit or loss apart from financial
             instruments of eurex clearing ag this category includes in particular interest rate swaps currency swaps
             and forward foreign exchange transactions if they are settled within one year they are allocated to cur
             rent assets all other financial assets are allocated to noncurrent assets

             fair value of these derivatives is calculated based on observable current market rates if resulting from
             banking business realised and unrealised gains and losses are immediately recognised in the con
             solidated income statement as other operating income and other operating expenses or if incurred
             outside the banking business as financial income and financial expenses

             loans and receivables
             loans and receivables comprise in particular current and noncurrent receivables from banking business
             trade receivables as well as other current receivables they are recognised at amortised cost taking into
             account any potential impairment losses if applicable premiums and discounts are included in the
             amortised cost of the instrument concerned and are amortised using the effective interest method they
             are contained in net interest income from banking business if they relate to banking business or in
             financial income and financial expense

             availableforsale financial assets
             nonderivative financial assets are classified as availableforsale financial assets if they cannot be
             allocated to the loans and receivables and assets held for trading categories these assets comprise
             debt and equity investments recognised in the other equity investments and other financial instruments
             items as well as debt instruments recognised in the current and noncurrent receivables and securities
             from banking business items

             availableforsale financial assets are generally measured at the fair value observable in an active market
             unrealised gains and losses are recognised directly in equity in the revaluation surplus impairment and
             effects of exchange rates on monetary items are excluded from this general rule they are recognised in
             profit or loss

equity instruments for which no active market exists are measured on the basis of current comparable
market transactions if these are available if an equity instrument is not traded in an active market and
alternative valuation methods cannot be applied to that equity instrument it is measured at cost subject
to an impairment test

realised gains and losses are generally recognised under financial income or financial expense interest
income is recognised in the consolidated income statement in net interest income from banking business
based on the effective interest rate method other realised gains and losses are recognised in the con
solidated income statement in other operating income and other operating expenses

if debt instruments of banking business are hedged instruments under fair value hedges hedge account
ing is applied for fair value adjustments corresponding to the hedged item see fair value hedges
section below

derecognition of financial assets
financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or when substan
tially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are transferred

clearstream banking sa acts as principal in securities borrowing and lending transactions in the context
of the aslplus securities lending system legally it operates between the lender and the borrower with
out being an economic contracting partner transitory items in these transactions the securities borrowed
and lent match each other consequently these transactions are not recognised in the consolidated
balance sheet

impairment of financial assets
financial assets that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss are reviewed at each balance
sheet date to establish whether there is any indication of impairment

deutsche börse group has laid down criteria for assessing whether there is evidence of impairment
these criteria primarily include significant financial difficulties on the part of the debtor and breaches
of contract

the amount of an impairment loss for a financial asset measured at amortised cost is the difference
between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the
original effective interest rate a subsequent reversal is recognised at a maximum at the carrying amount
that would have resulted if no impairment loss had been recognised

the amount of an impairment loss for a financial asset measured at cost equity instruments that are
nonlisted is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future
cash flows discounted at a current market interest rate subsequent reversal is not permitted

in the case of availableforsale financial assets the impairment loss is calculated as the difference
between cost and fair value any reduction in fair value already recognised in equity is reclassified to
profit or loss upon determination of the impairment loss a subsequent reversal may only be recognised
for debt instruments if the reason for the original impairment loss no longer applies

             financial liabilities

             financial liabilities relate primarily to interestbearing liabilities other noncurrent liabilities liabilities
             from banking business financial instruments of eurex clearing ag cash deposits by market participants
             as well as trade payables they are recognised when a group company becomes a contracting party to
             the instrument

             they are generally recognised at the trade date purchases and sales of equities via the central counter
             party ie eurex clearing ag are recognised at the settlement date

             netting of financial assets and liabilities
             financial assets and liabilities are offset and only the net amount is presented in the consolidated balance
             sheet when a group company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts
             and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously



             financial liabilities not measured at fair value through profit and loss
             financial liabilities not held for trading are carried at amortised cost these liabilities comprise issued
             bonds and private placements the borrowing costs associated with the placement of financial liabilities
             are included in the carrying amount within the framework of the effective interest method if they are
             directly attributable discounts reduce the carrying amount of liabilities and are amortised over the term
             of the liabilities

             financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss
             a forward transaction with a noncontrolling shareholder for the acquisition of noncontrolling interests
             that is settled in cash or by delivering other financial assets is a financial liability recognised at fair value
             it is subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss the equity interest attributable to a
             noncontrolling shareholder underlying the transaction is accounted for as if it had already been acquired
             at the time of the transaction



             derivatives and hedges

             derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk all derivatives are carried at their
             fair values the fair value of interest rate swaps is determined on the basis of current observable market
             interest rates the fair value of forward foreign exchange transactions is determined on the basis of for
             ward foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date for the remaining period to maturity

             hedge accounting is used for derivatives that are part of a hedging relationship determined to be highly
             effective and for which certain conditions are met this relates in particular to the documentation of the
             hedging relationship and the risk strategy and to how reliably the effectiveness can be measured

             cash flow hedges
             the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument determined to be highly effective is recognised
             directly in equity this gain or loss ultimately adjusts the value of the hedged cash flow ie the gain or
             loss from the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss when the hedged item is recognised in
             the balance sheet or in profit or loss the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately
             in the consolidated income statement

the gain or loss on the hedging instrument together with the gain or loss on the hedged item underlying
attributable to the hedged risk is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement any
gain or loss on the hedged item adjusts its carrying amount

hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
the effective portion of the gain or loss from a hedging transaction that is designated as a highly effec
tive hedge is recognised directly in equity it is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation
is sold the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income
statement

pensions and other employee benefits

pensions and other employee benefits relate to defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans

defined contribution pension plans
there are defined contribution plans as part of the occupational pension system via pension funds and
similar pension institutions as well as on the basis of the 401k plan in addition contributions are
paid to the statutory pension insurance scheme the level of contributions is normally determined in
relation to income no provisions are recognised for defined contribution plans the contributions paid
are reported as pension expenses in the year of payment

there are defined contribution pension plans for employees working in germany luxembourg the czech
republic the uk and the usa in addition the employer pays contributions to employees private pen
sion funds

defined benefit plans
provisions for pension obligations are measured separately for each pension plan using the projected
unit credit method on the basis of actuarial reports the fair value of plan assets taking into account the
asset ceiling rules if there are any surplus plan assets is deducted from the present value of pension
obligations this results in the net defined benefit liability or asset net interest for the financial year is
calculated by applying the discount rate determined at the beginning of the financial year to the net
defined benefit liability determined as at that date

the relevant discount rate is determined by reference to the return on longterm corporate bonds with a
rating of at least aa moodys investors service standard  poors fitch ratings and dominion bond
rating service on the basis of the information provided by bloomberg and a maturity that corresponds
approximately to the maturity of the pension obligations moreover the bonds must be denominated in
the same currency as the underlying pension obligation measurement of the pension obligations in
euros is based on a discount rate of 34 per cent which is determined according to the towers watson
globalratelink methodology updated in line with the current market trend

actuarial gains or losses resulting from changes in expectations with regard to life expectancy pension
trends salary trends or the discount rate as compared with the estimate at the beginning of the period
or compared with the actual development during the period are recognised directly in other comprehen
sive income actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income may not be reclassi
fied to profit or loss in subsequent periods similarly differences between the interest income on plan
assets determined at the beginning of the period and the return on plan assets actually recorded at the
end of the period are also recognised directly in other comprehensive income the actuarial gains or
losses and the difference between the expected and the actual return or loss on plan assets are recog
nised as revaluation surplus

other longterm benefits for employees and members of executive boards total disability pension tran
sitional payments and surviving dependents pensions are also measured using the projected unit credit
method actuarial gains and losses and past service cost are recognised immediately and in full through
profit or loss

222   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             other provisions

             provisions are recognised if the group has a present obligation from an event in the past an outflow of
             resources with economic benefit to settle the obligation is probable and it is possible to reliably estimate
             the amount of this obligation the amount of the provision corresponds to the best possible estimate of
             the expense which is necessary to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date a provision for restruc
             turing is only recognised when an entity has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised
             a valid expectation in those affected that the restructuring measures will be implemented for example
             by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it contingent
             liabilities are not recognised but disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying
             economic benefits is remote



             sharebased payment

             deutsche börse group operates the group share plan and the stock bonus plan sbp which provide
             sharebased payment components for employees senior executives and executive board members

             group share plan
             under the group share plan shares are granted at a discount to the market price the expense of this
             discount is recognised in the income statement at the grant date

             stock bonus plan sbp
             the sbp shares are generally accounted for as sharebased payments for which deutsche börse ag has
             a choice of settlement in cash and equity instruments in financial year 2013 as in the previous years
             a standard contract was drafted to settle the tranche due in the following year in cash under these
             circumstances there is at present a presumption in accordance with ifrs 2 that all sbp shares will
             be settled in cash accordingly deutsche börse group has measured the sbp shares as cashsettled
             sharebased payment transactionsthe cost of the options is estimated using an option pricing model
             fair value measurement and recognised in staff costs in the income statement any right to payment
             of a stock bonus only vests after the expiration of the service or performance period on which the plan
             is based

             a separate variable sharebased payment has been agreed for deutsche börse ags executive board
             since financial year 2010 the number of virtual shares for each executive board member is calculated
             on the basis of deutsche börse ags average share price in the two months preceding the point in time
             at which the supervisory board establishes the 100 per cent target value for the variable share compo
             nent the calculation of the subsequent payout amount of the stock bonus depends on the change in
             relative shareholder return and deutsche börse ags share price performance claims under this stock
             bonus programme are settled in cash after the expiration of the threeyear performance period



             deferred tax assets and liabilities

             deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the balance sheet approach the deferred tax
             calculation is based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the tax accounts and
             the carrying amounts in the ifrs financial statements that lead to a future tax liability or benefit when
             assets are used or sold or liabilities are settled

shares   services   2013   horizons   strategic perspectives   responsibility   governance   management report   financial statements   notes   223

the deferred tax assets or liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are currently expected to apply
when the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date deferred tax assets are recognised for the carryforward of unused tax
losses only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available deferred tax assets
and deferred tax liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities exists and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes
levied by the same taxation authority



leases

leases are classified as operating leases or finance leases a lease is classified as a finance lease if it
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset from the lessor to the
lessee all other leases are classified as operating leases

leased assets and the associated liabilities are recognised at the lower of fair value and the present
value of the minimum lease payments if the criteria for classification as a finance lease are met the
leased asset is depreciated or amortised using the straightline method over its useful life or the lease
term if shorter in subsequent periods the liability is measured using the effective interest method

expenses incurred in connection with operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straightline
basis over the lease term



consolidation

all subsidiaries directly or indirectly controlled by deutsche börse ag are included in deutsche
börse ags consolidated financial statements deutsche börse group controls a company if it is ex
posed to variable returns resulting from its involvement with the company in question or has rights
to such returns and is able to influence them by using its power over the company

initial consolidation of subsidiaries in the course of business combinations uses the purchase method
the acquirees identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair values at
the acquisition date any excess of cost over the acquirers interest in the fair value of the subsidiarys
net identifiable assets is recognised as goodwill goodwill is reported in subsequent periods at cost less
accumulated impairment losses

intragroup assets and liabilities are eliminated income arising from intragroup transactions is eliminated
against the corresponding expenses profits or losses arising from deliveries of intragroup goods and
services as well as dividends distributed within the group are eliminated deferred taxes are recognised
for consolidation adjustments where these are expected to reverse in subsequent years

interests in equity attributable to noncontrolling interest shareholders are carried under noncontrolling
interests within equity where these are classified as puttable instruments they are reported under
liabilities

             currency translation

             transactions denominated in a currency other than a companys functional currency are translated into
             the functional currency at the spot exchange rate applicable at the transaction date at the balance sheet
             date monetary balance sheet items in foreign currency are measured at the exchange rate at the bal
             ance sheet date while nonmonetary balance sheet items recognised at historical cost are measured at
             the exchange rate on the transaction date nonmonetary balance sheet items measured at fair value
             are translated at the closing rate on the valuation date exchange rate differences are recorded as other
             operating income or expense in the period in which they arise unless the underlying transactions are
             hedged gains and losses from a monetary item that forms part of a net investment in a foreign oper
             ation are recognised directly in accumulated profit

             the annual financial statements of companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated
             into the reporting currency as follows assets and liabilities are translated into euros at the closing rate
             the items in the consolidated income statement are translated at the average exchange rates for the
             period under review resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in accumulated profit when
             the relevant subsidiary is sold these exchange differences are recognised in consolidated profit for the
             period in which the deconsolidation gain or loss is realised

             any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carry

             currency of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate



             key sources of estimation uncertainty and management judgements

             the application of accounting policies presentation of assets and liabilities and recognition of income
             and expenses requires the executive board to make certain judgements and estimates adjustments in
             this context are taken into account in the period the change was made as well as in subsequent periods
             where necessary

             impairment
             deutsche börse group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at
             least once a year certain assumptions have to be made to determine the recoverable amount which is
             calculated regularly using discounted cash flow models this is based on the relevant business plans

with a time horizon of 3 to 5 years these plans in turn contain projections of the future financial per
formance of the cashgenerating units if their actual financial performance fails to meet these expecta
tions corresponding adjustments may be necessary for further information on the effects of changes in
the discount rate and further assumptions please see note 11

pensions and other employee benefits
pensions and other employee benefits are measured using the projected unit credit method which
calculates the actuarial present value of the accumulated benefit obligation calculating the present
value requires certain actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate staff turnover rate salary and
pension trends to be made the current service cost and the net interest expense or income for the
subsequent period are calculated on the basis of these assumptions any departures from these as
sumptions for example because of changes in the macroeconomic environment are recognised in
other comprehensive income in the following financial year a sensitivity analysis of the key factors
is presented in note 22

income taxes
deutsche börse group is subject to the tax laws of those countries in which it operates and generates
income considerable management judgement has to be exercised in determining the tax provisions
for a large number of transactions and calculations no definitive taxrelevant information is available
at the time these figures are determined deutsche börse group recognises corresponding provisions
for risks expected from external tax audits if the final results of these external audits differ from the
estimates the resulting effects on current and deferred taxes are recognised in the period in which
they become known

legal risks
deutsche börse ag or its group companies are subject to litigation such litigation may lead to orders to
pay against the entities of the group if it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will occur a
provision will be recognised based on an estimate of the most probable amount necessary to settle the
obligation if such amount is reasonably estimable management judgement includes the determination
whether there is a possible obligation from past events the evaluation of the probability that an out
flow will occur and the estimation of the potential amount as the outcome of litigation is usually uncer
tain the judgement is reviewed continuously for further information on other risks please see note 37

group share plans
   note 39 contains disclosures on the valuation model used for the stock options where the estimates
of the valuation parameters originally applied differ from the actual values available when the options are
exercised adjustments are necessary such adjustments are recognised in the consolidated income
statement for the period if they relate to cashsettled sharebased payment transactions

provisions
in addition the probable utilisation applied when establishing provisions for expected losses from rental
agreements is estimated see note 24 in the creation of personnelrelated restructuring provisions
certain assumptions were made with regard to for example fluctuation rate discount rate and salary
trends should the actual values deviate from these assumptions adjustments may be necessary

goodwill the stock exchange licences acquired as part of the acquisitions of the international securities
exchange and the börse frankfurt zertifikate as well as the acquired trade name of stoxx are intangible
assets with an indefinite useful life the recoverable amounts of the cashgenerating units with allocated
goodwill are based either on their values in use cgu clearstream and cgu eurex or on their fair value
less costs of disposal cgu market data  services cgu infobolsa cgu fund services and cgu börse
frankfurt zertifikate only in cases in which one of these values value in use or fair value less costs of
disposal does not exceed the carrying amount the respective other value is calculated since there is no
active market for the cashgenerating units the discounted cash flow method is used to calculate both
value in use and fair value less costs of disposal

the key assumptions made to determine the recoverable amounts vary depending on the cashgenerating
unit concerned pricing or market share assumptions are based on past experience or market research
other key assumptions are mainly based on external factors significant macroeconomic indicators in
clude for instance equity index levels volatility of equity indices as well as interest rates exchange
rates gdp growth unemployment levels and government debt the discount rate is based on a riskfree
interest rate between 25 and 26 per cent and a market risk premium of 65 per cent it is used to cal
culate individual discount rates for each cashgenerating unit that reflect the beta factors the cost of
debt and capital structure of the peer groups concerned

each calculation of the sensitivities stated below is based on the adaption of a parameter discount rate
sales revenue and growth rate of a perpetual annuity by assuming that all other parameters in the
evaluation model remain unchanged possible correlations between the parameters are not considered

cashgenereating unit eurex
the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of ise is allocated to a group of cashgenerating units
in the eurex segment

since the ise goodwill is calculated in us dollars an exchange rate difference of 400 million

             assumptions on volumes of index and interest rate derivatives and volumes in the us equity options
             market which are derived from external sources are the key criteria applied to determine the value
             in use with the discounted cash flow method

             cash flows are projected over a fiveyear period 2014 to 2018 for european as well as us activities
             cash flow projections beyond this period are as in the previous year extrapolated assuming a 10 per
             cent growth rate the pretax discount rate used is 134 per cent 2012 130 per cent

             neither an increase in the discount rate by 10 per cent nor a reduction in the planned sales revenue by
             50 per cent per year nor a decrease in the growth rate of the perpetual annuity to 0 per cent would lead

             used to determine value in use

             cash flows are projected over a fiveyear period 2014 to 2018 cash flow projections beyond 2018
             are extrapolated assuming a perpetual annuity with a growth rate of 15 per cent 2012 25 per cent
             the pretax discount rate used is calculated on the basis of the cost of equity and amounts to 146 per

             neither an increase in the discount rate by 10 per cent nor a reduction in the planned sales revenue by

             other intangible assets ise
             ises other intangible assets are tested for impairment at the end of the year the recoverable amount
             of these assets is calculated on the basis of the value in use of the ise cashgenerating unit which is
             attributable to the eurex segment the cashgenerating unit of the ise subgroup are the us options
             exchanges

             the key assumptions made which are based on analysts estimates relate to expected volumes and
             transaction prices on the us options market cash flows are projected over a fiveyear period 2014
             to 2018 a 25 per cent growth rate is assumed beyond 2018 2012 25 per cent the pretax
             discount rate used is 180 per cent 2012 162 per cent

             exchange licence of ise
             in the course of the purchase price allocation carried out in december 2007 the fair value of the ex
             change licence was determined the exchange licence granted in 2000 by the us securities and
             exchange commission permits the ise subgroup to operate as a regulated securities exchange in the
             united states the exchange licence held by the ise subgroup is estimated to have an indefinite useful
             life because the licence itself does not have a finite term and eurex management expects to maintain
             the licence as part of its overall business strategy

the exchange licence does not generate cash flows largely independent from those generated by
the ise subgroup as a whole consequently the exchange licence is allocated to the ise subgroup
as the cashgenerating unit

member relationships and market data customer relationships of ise
in the context of the purchase price allocation the fair values of member and customer relationships
were calculated both assets are being amortised over a period of 30 years using the straightline
method cash flows do not result from either the member or the customer relationships which would
be independent of the entire ise subgroup consequently both items are allocated to the cashgener
ating unit ise subgroup

ise trade name
the ise trade name is registered as a trade name and therefore meets the ifrs criterion for recognition
separately from goodwill in accordance with the purchase price allocation of december 2007 the asset
is being amortised over a period of ten years using the straightline method as there are no cash inflows
that are generated independently from the ise subgroup the trade name is also allocated to the cash
generating unit ise subgroup

an increase in the discount rate by 10 per cent a reduction in the planned sales revenue by 50 per
cent per year or a decrease in the growth rate of the perpetual annuity to 0 per cent would lead to an
impairment in the other intangible assets in the cashgenerating unit ise amounting to a volume of
7 million to 55 million a more positive development of the parameters in future could in contrast
to the assumptions above result in a reversal of impairment of the other intangible assets of ise

other intangible assets stoxx
the stoxx trade name the companys customer relationships as well as fully amortised noncompete
agreements and other intangible assets are identified as part of the acquisition of stoxx ltd and allo
cated to the stoxx cashgenerating unit as they do not generate cash independently the stoxx
cashgenerating unit is allocated to the market data  services segment

the impairment test was based on fair value less costs of disposal taking into account expected devel
opments in the licence and sales fees for indices and data cash flows are projected over a fiveyear
period 2014 to 2018 cash flow projections beyond 2018 are extrapolated assuming a 20 per cent
2012 20 per cent growth rate the aftertax discount rate amounts to 108 per cent 2012 102 per
cent

stoxx trade name
the stoxx trade name includes the trade name itself the index methodologies and the internet domains
because these can generally not be transferred separately as the trade name is registered it meets the
ifrs criterion for recognition separately from goodwill an indefinite useful life was assumed for the
stoxx brand name given its history and the fact that it is well known on the market

customer relationships of stoxx
stoxx ltd has relationships with customers which are based on signed contracts and thus meet the
identifiability criterion for recognition separately from goodwill

             regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios

             clearstream banking sa clearstream banking ag and eurex clearing ag as well as the regulatory
             clearstream holding group are subject to solvency supervision by the german or luxembourg banking
             supervisory authorities bundesanstalt für finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht bafin and commission de sur
             veillance du secteur financier cssf respectively all companies that are subject to this supervision are
             nontradingbook institutions market price risk positions consist only of a relatively small open foreign
             currency position as a result of these companies specific businesses their on balance sheet assets
             are subject to sharp fluctuations this leads to correspondingly volatile solvency ratios in the clearstream
             companies the volatility of the ratio is subject to major fluctuations on a daytoday basis in the course
             of the year due to a high degree of collateralised or zeroweighted cash investments the capital require
             ments for credit and market price risks of eurex clearing ag are relatively stable despite volatile total
             assets

             the capital requirements are subject to the national regulations of the individual companies these are
             based on eu banking and capital requirements directives which are ultimately based on basel ii the
             companies concerned homogeneously apply the standardised approach for credit risk for calculating
             the operational risk charge eurex clearing ag uses the basic indicator approach while the clearstream
             companies apply the advanced measurement approach ama

             of the companies subject to solvency supervision only clearstream banking sa has tier 2 regulatory
             capital under the relevant ifrs treatment this capital consists of a profit participation right of 150
             million and to a very small amount in the revaluation surplus the profit participation right had originally
             been subscribed by deutsche börse ag in the course of measures taken to further strengthen clear
             streams capital base this profit participation right was contributed to clearstream holding ags capital
             reserves and upgraded to tier 2 capital at the level of clearstream banking sa by making certain ad
             justments to the profit participation terms

             a minimum solvency ratio of 8 per cent applies throughout to the regulated companies all regulated
             companies clearstream banking sa clearstream banking ag eurex clearing ag and the clearstream
             holding group have been designated as systemically important as a result cssf increased the mini
             mum capital requirements for clearstream banking sa to a core tier 1 ratio of 9 per cent in 2013 the
             individual companies capital resources sufficiently reflect the fluctuation in riskweighted assets stress
             considerations are used to determine the capital required for expected peaks and additional reserves for
             unexpected events are added the capital requirements determined in this way are met through the capi
             tal resources as the actual capital requirements are below the expected peaks  significantly so under
             normal circumstances  this may lead to a very high technical closing date solvency ratio

                                                                                                       consolidated balance sheet disclosures




the capital requirements of the clearstream companies rose in the year under review this was mainly
driven by considerably increased capital requirements for operational risk combined with simultaneously
lowered capital requirements for credit and market price risk the increased capital requirements for
operational risk are in turn largely the result of expanded risk scenarios for legal and compliance risks
the international reach of the business within an increasingly more complex regulatory and legal frame
work makes it necessary to take greater account of these risks additionally the settlement payment of
around us150 million made to the office of foreign assets control ofac and payments made by
other banks in the course of various proceedings have given an indication of the extent of potential loss
events the increased capital requirements almost exclusively affect clearstream banking sa since the
nature of clearstream banking ags national business means that its exposure to these risks is signifi
cantly limited due to closing date effects customer balances especially those denominated in us dol
lars and euros declined significantly compared with the end of 2012 resulting in lower balances on the
nostro accounts and consequently lower capital requirements for credit risk

the clearstream holding group responded to the increased capital requirements by launching a programme
to strengthen its capital base the programme entails an injection at the level of clearstream holding ag
including the contribution of the profit participation right of 150 million issued by clearstream
banking sa the retention of profits at clearstream banking sa and clearstream international sa
capital injections to the bank subsidiaries performed by clearstream international sa and the upgrade
of clearstream banking sas profit participation rights to tier 2 capital in spite of the increased capital
requirements these capitalisation measures currently secure solvency ratios of more than 20 per cent

the clearstream holding group therefore does not expect to require any capital in the short to medium
term in the medium to long term only a moderate  if any  increase in capital requirements at group
level is expected to arise from the capital buffers that are to be imposed in stages from 2014 onwards
the requirements resulting from mandatory recovery plans the designation as systemically important
institutions and the future csd regulation the transfer of the supervisory function for clearstream
banking sa to the ecb is however not expected to have a material impact on capital requirements

the cash collateral deposited at eurex clearing ag fluctuated in the course of the year but remained
at a high level overall eurex clearing ags capital requirements rose only slightly compared with the
previous year mainly as a result of closing date effects relating to credit and market risk and of down
stream effects resulting from the calculation of averages used in the assessment of capital requirements
in relation to operational risk

eurex clearing ags internal risk model assumes higher capital requirements for operational risk than
does the accountingbased basic indicator approach in accordance with regulatory requirements for this
reason eurex clearing ag has always maintained a capital buffer for these types of risk over and above
the minimum regulatory requirements against this background the banking supervisory authorities
encouraged eurex clearing ag in 2011 to expand the basis for calculating the regulatory capital require
ments to include an adequate clearing portion of the fees collected for the account of the operating com
panies the capital requirements for operational risk are calculated once a year on the basis of a three
year average of historical income including the assumed clearing fees and are therefore not subject to
daily fluctuations compliance with the minimum supervisory ratio is maintained at all times due to the
sufficient capital buffer for uncollateralised cash investments

             on 1 august 2013 eurex clearing ag submitted its application for authorisation as a central counter
             party under the european market infrastructure regulation emir article 16 of emir in conjunction
             with the eus level 2 implementing directive sets its own capital adequacy requirements although
             these requirements are essentially based on the rules for credit institutions the resulting capital require
             ments differ from the requirements for banks because they include additional requirement for orderly
             winding down or restructuring and for business risk as well as a number of other minor matters and a
             different definition of capital among other things eurex clearing ags share of the default fund is
             deducted from its german gaap capital without the capital buffers which will in future only be stipu
             lated in the regulatory framework for banks the requirement under emir is significantly more stringent
             than under the bank framework in preparation for its application for emir authorisation eurex clearing
             ag increased its equity at the beginning of 2013 by adding 110 million to its capital reserves the
             authorisation is expected to be granted in the second quarter of 2014 the emir requirements did not
             yet apply as at the balance sheet date the increase in equity resulted in a significantly improved sol
             vency ratio while capital requirements were only slightly higher

             given the high capital requirements under emir eurex clearing ag does not currently expect the intro
             duction of capital requirements directive crd iv capital buffers from 2014 onwards to have a signifi
             cant impact on capital requirements independent of this the capital resources of eurex clearing ag are
             reviewed on an ongoing basis and monitored as part of mediumterm capital planning however given
             the continuing development of the basis for emir capital requirements income and costs and business
             performance within a changed regulatory framework emir crd iv for eurex clearing ag and its cus
             tomers small capital increases cannot be ruled out

risks
in addition to the general actuarial risks the risks associated with the defined benefit obligations relate
especially to financial risks in connection with the plan assets including in particular counterparty credit
and market price risks

264   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             market price risk
             the return on plan assets is assumed to be the discount rate determined on the basis of corporate bonds
             with an aa rating if the actual rate of return on plan assets is lower than the discount rate used the net
             defined benefit liability increases accordingly after a reduction in the equity ratio of the plan assets held
             in germany in 2013 and at a lower volatility the actual return is further expected to exceed the return
             on corporate bonds with a good credit in the medium to long term

             deutsche börse group considers the share price risk resulting from the equity ratio of the plan assets to
             be appropriate the company bases its assessment on the expectation that the overall volume of pay
             ments from the pension plans will be manageable in the next few years that the total amount of the
             obligations will also be manageable and that it will be able to meet these payments in full from operating
             cash flows any amendments to the investment policy take into account the duration of the pension
             obligation as well as the expected payments over a period of ten years

             moreover the level of the net liability is influenced by the discount rates in particular whereby the cur
             rent low interest rates contribute to a relatively high net liability a continued decline in returns on corpo
             rate bonds will lead to a further increase in defined benefit obligations which can be only partially offset
             by the positive development of the fair values of the corporate bonds included in the plan assets

             inflation risk
             possible inflation risks that could lead to an increase in defined benefit obligations exist because some
             pension plans or the annual capital components are directly related to the salaries ie a significant
             increase in salaries would lead to an increase in the benefit obligation from the plans in germany
             however there are no contractual arrangements with regard to inflation risk for these pension plans
             an interest rate of 6 per cent pa has been agreed for the employeefinanced deferred compensation
             plan the plan does not include any arrangements for inflation so that it has to be assumed that there
             will be little incentive for employees to contribute to the deferred compensation plan in times of rising
             inflation

             in luxembourg salaries are adjusted for the effects of inflation on the basis of a consumer price index no
             more than once a year this adjustment leads to a corresponding increase in the benefit obligation from
             the pension plan since the obligation will be met in the form of a capital payment there will be no
             inflationlinked effects once the beneficiary reaches retirement age

             in switzerland the benefit plans at axa stiftung berufliche vorsorge and prevas sammelstiftung include
             the provision that the board of the foundation decides annually whether the retirement pensions will be
             adjusted to price trends the decision takes into account in particular the financial capability of the
             foundation there are no arrangements for automatic adjustments to price increases over and above the
             legal requirements that apply to certain surviving dependants and disability pensions

in the course of 2013 no reclassifications were made between the individual levels

financial assets and financial liabilities listed in levels 2 and 3 as at 31 december 2013 are measured
as follows

the derivatives listed in level 2 comprise forward foreign exchange transactions the fair value of the
forward foreign exchange transactions is determined on the basis of the forward foreign exchange rates
for the remaining period to maturity as at the balance sheet date they are based on observable market
prices

276   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             the equity investments allocated to level 2 are measured on the basis of current comparable market
             transactions

             puttable instruments with a carrying amount of 34 million were allocated to level 3 as at the begin
             ning of the year under review these were measured using the discounted cash flow method in the
             second quarter of 2013 the current portion of the puttable instruments amounting to 04 million was
             exercised in the course of the third quarter a settlement agreement in the amount of 10 million was
             reached for this longterm put resulting in an effect recognised in profit or loss of 20 million as at the
             balance sheet date at the end of the year under review derivative financial instruments belonging to an
             incentive programme amounting to 61 million were allocated to level 3 the financial instruments were
             measured at fair value through profit and loss using an internal model the model takes into account the
             criteria underlying the conditional repayment of the grant made by eurex clearing ag the financial in
             struments were regularly measured at fair value through profit and loss using an internal model as at
             the quarterly balance sheet dates the results from the subsequent measurement are recognised under
             other operating expenses the model takes into account the criteria underlying the conditional repay
             ment of the grant made by eurex clearing ag the criteria include in particular nonfinancial indicators
             as the expected number of customers in a specific market segment as well as expected trading volumes
             they are continuously monitored while taking possible adjustments into account for this information
             of customers is also used since there is an internal model the parameters can be different as at the
             settlement date however the derivative financial instrument will not exceed an amount of 80 million
             this amount arises if the beneficiaries of the incentive programme fulfill the conditions and a repayment
             of the contribution is not taken into consideration

             the fair value of other financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value is determined as follows

             the euro and us dollar bonds issued by deutsche börse group have a fair value of 15518 million
             31 december 2012 18219 million and are reported under interestbearing liabilities eurodenom
             inated bonds with a principal amount of 6000 million were issued at the end of the first quarter of
             2013 eurodenominated bonds with a principal amount of 7978 million matured in the course of the
             second quarter of 2013 the fair value is calculated on the basis of the quoted values of the bonds or as
             the present value of the cash flows relating to the private placements on the basis of market parameters

             the carrying amounts of the following items represent a reasonable approximation of their fair value

              unlisted equity instruments whose fair value generally cannot be reliably determined on a continuous
               basis and which are reported under the financial assets item these are carried at cost less any im

down by markets into the following four segments

in accordance with ifrs 8 information on the segments is presented on the basis of internal reporting
management approach as a result of the changes made to deutsche börse groups organisational
structure as at 1 january 2013 various business areas eg trading participant connectivity it services
and cooperations with partner exchanges were transferred from the previous market segments in par
ticular xetra to the new market data  services segment in this context net revenue cost and em
ployees directly or indirectly associated with these business areas have also been reallocated prioryear
figures have been adjusted accordingly

sales revenue is presented separately by external sales revenue and internal intersegment sales reve
nue intersegment services are charged on the basis of measured quantities or at fixed prices eg the
provision of data by eurex to market data  services

due to their insignificance to segment reporting the financial income and financial expense items
have been combined to produce the net financial result

             credit risk concentrations
             deutsche börse groups business model and the resulting business relationships with a large part of the
             financial sector mean that as a rule credit risk is concentrated on the financial services sector potential
             concentrations of credit risk on individual counterparties are limited by application of counterparty credit
             limits

             the regulatory requirements such as those arising under the großkredit und millionenkreditverordnung
             gromikv ordinance governing large exposures and loans of 15 million or more in germany and the
             corresponding rules in luxembourg arising under the revised cssf circular 06273 are complied with

             the german and luxembourgian rules are based on the eu directives 200648ec and 200649ec
             commonly known as crd as revised in 2009 with effect as at 31 december 2010

             see also      note 20 for an explanation of regulatory capital requirements

             deutsche börse group carries out var calculations in order to detect credit concentration risks in 2013
             no significant credit concentrations were assessed

             the required economic capital for credit risk is calculated for each business day and amounted to 311
             million as at 31 december 2013 2012 184 million the increase is driven by two main factors firstly
             the required economic capital is now calculated as the undiversified sum of the required economic capi
             tal of the segments companies and risk types and secondly the credit risk of eurex clearing ag in
             creased due to the increase of its own contribution to the default fund skin in the game



             market price risk

             as part of the annual planning the treasury policy of deutsche börse group requires that any net earn
             ings exposure from currencies be hedged through foreign exchange transactions if the unhedged expo
             sure exceeds 10 per cent of consolidated ebit foreign exchange exposures below 10 per cent of consol
             idated ebit may also be hedged

             during the year actual foreign exchange exposure is monitored against the latest ebit forecast in case
             of an overstepping of the 10 per cent threshold the exceeding amount must be hedged

             in addition the policy stipulates that intraperiod open foreign exchange positions are closed when they
             exceed 150 million this policy was complied with as in the previous year as at 31 december 2013
             there were no significant net foreign exchange positions

currency risks in the group arise mainly from the operating results and balance sheet items of ise
which are denominated in us dollars plus that part of clearstreams sales revenue and interest income
less expenses which is directly or indirectly generated in us dollars as at 31 december 2013 ise
accounted for 26 per cent of the eurex segments sales revenue 2012 23 per cent in addition the
clearstream segment generated 9 per cent of its sales revenue and interest income 2012 9 per cent
directly or indirectly in us dollars

acquisitions where payment of the purchase price results in currency risk are generally hedged

the group has partially hedged its investment in ise against foreign currency risks by issuing fixed
income us dollar debt securities the investment in ise hedged item constitutes a net investment in
a foreign operation the us dollar securities designated as hedging instruments for the net investment
hedge were issued in a nominal amount of us4600 million

interest rate risks arise further from debt financing of acquisitions the acquisition of ise was financed
through senior and hybrid debt that matured or has been called in 2013

to refinance 2013 debt maturities deutsche börse ag in october 2012 and march 2013 successfully
issued senior bonds in an amount of 600 million each

equity price risks arise from contractual trust arrangements ctas and from the clearstream pension
fund in luxembourg in addition there are equity price risks arising from strategic equity investments
in other exchange operators

economic capital is calculated at the end of each month for market price risks that can arise in connec
tion with cash investments or borrowing as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange
rates as well as through fluctuations of the asset value of the cta and the clearstream pension fund in
luxembourg on 31 december 2013 the economic capital for market price risk was 77 million 2012
1 million the increase is mainy driven by two factors firstly the required economic capital is now
calculated as the undiversified sum of the required economic capital of the segments companies and
risk types and secondly the market price risk increased because the ctas and clearstream pension
fund in luxembourg are now included in the calculation

in financial year 2013 impairment losses amounting to 16 million 2012 133 million were rec
ognised in profit and loss for strategic investments that are not included in the var for market price risk

             liquidity risk

             for the group liquidity risk may arise from potential difficulties in renewing maturing financing such
             as commercial paper and bilateral and syndicated credit facilities in addition required financing for
             unexpected events may result in a liquidity risk most of the groups cash investments are shortterm

other litigation and liability risks

contingent liabilities may result from present obligations and from possible obligations from events in the
past deutsche börse group recognises provisions for the possible incurrence of losses only if there is a
present obligation from an event in the past which is likely to cause an outflow of resources and if it is
possible to reliably estimate the amount of such obligation see also note 3 in order to determine for
which proceedings the possibility of incurring a loss is more than unlikely as well as how the possible
loss is estimated deutsche börse group takes into account a multitude of factors including the nature
of the claim and the facts on which it is based the jurisdiction and course of the individual proceedings
the experience of deutsche börse group prior settlement talks as far as have already taken place as
well as reports and evaluations of legal advisors however it is possible that a reliable estimate for a
given proceedings could not be determined before the release of the consolidated financial statements
and that  as a result  no provisions are recognised

39 sharebased payment

stock bonus plan sbp and stock plan

in the year under review the company established an additional tranche of the sbp in order to partici
pate in the sbp a beneficiary must have earned a bonus the number of stock options for senior execu
tives is determined by the amount of the individual and performancebased sbp bonus for the financial
year divided by the average share price xetra closing price of deutsche börse ags shares in the
fourth quarter of the financial year in question neither the converted sbp bonus nor the stock options will
be paid at the time the bonus is determined rather the entitlement is generally received two or three
years after having been granted socalled waiting period within this period beneficiaries cannot
assert shareholder rights in particular the right to receive dividends and attend the annual general meet
ing once they have met the condition of service the beneficiaries claims resulting from the sbp are
calculated on the first trading day following the last day of the waiting period the current market
price at that date closing auction price of deutsche börse share in electronic trading on the frankfurt
stock exchange is multiplied by the number of sbp shares

since 1 january 2010 a different method has been applied to calculate the number of stock options for
executive board members which is described below

to calculate the number of stock options for executive board members under the 2010 sbp tranche and
all subsequent tranches the supervisory board defines the 100 per cent stock bonus target in euros
for each executive board member at the beginning of each financial year based on the 100 per cent
stock bonus target defined by the supervisory board at the beginning of each financial year the corre
sponding number of virtual shares for each executive board member is calculated by dividing the
stock bonus target by the average share price xetra closing price of deutsche börse ags shares in
the two calendar months preceding the month in which the supervisory board adopts the resolution on
the stock bonus target any right to payment of a stock bonus vests only after a performance period of
three years the year in which the 100 per cent stock bonus target is defined is taken to be the first
performance year

298   deutsche börse group corporate report 2013




             the calculation of the subsequent payout amount of the stock bonus for the executive board depends
             on the development of two performance factors during the performance period firstly on the relative
             performance of the total shareholder return tsr on deutsche börse ags shares compared with the
             total shareholder return of the stoxx europe 600 financials index as the peer group and secondly on
             the performance of deutsche börse ags share price this is multiplied by the number of virtual shares
             at the end of the performance period to determine the stock bonus the share price used to calculate
             the cash payment claims of executive board members from the stock bonus is calculated as the average
             price of deutsche börse ags shares xetra closing price in the two full calendar months preceding the
             end of the performance period

             on 20 april 2009 the luxembourgian commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf pub
             lished a circular on remuneration policies in the banking sector that addresses key aspects of remunera
             tion practices for sustainable corporate governance and support their implementation in banking institu
             tions daytoday operations according to this circular every banking institution is required to introduce
             a remuneration policy that is in harmony with its business strategy and corporate goals and values as
             well as the longterm interests of the financial enterprise its customers and investors and which mini
             mises the institutions risk position clearstream companies in luxembourg have therefore revised their
             remuneration system for executive boards in line with the circular and introduced a socalled stock plan
             the exercise process for this stock plan stipulates the allocation of a stock bonus at the end of each
             financial year which will be paid in three tranches of equal size with maturities of one two or three
             years after the grant date claims under the stock plan have to be cashsettled if the performance targets
             already agreed in the year in which the targets were specified are met irrespective of any condition of
             service

             the number of stock options under the stock plan is determined by the amount of the individual per
             formancebased bonus established for each executive board member divided by the average market
             price xetra closing price for deutsche börse ag shares in the fourth quarter of the financial year in
             question as the contracts require the stock bonus to be exercised gradually it is divided into three sepa
             rate tranches which are measured according to their respective residual term using the corresponding
             parameters of the stock bonus plan for senior executives

             in april 2012 eurex frankfurt ag introduced a special remuneration component for its executive board
             members in the form of a separate sbp tranche with a term of 21 months this tranche matured in
             december 2013 and is cashsettled in january at a price of 5977

             a new sbp programme was launched in april 2013 for members of the executive board of eurex
             clearing ag this programme has a threeyear waiting period from the grant date this sbp tranche
             is measured using the same parameters as the share bonus plan for senior executives

             for the stock bonus of senior executives under the 2011 to 2013 tranches deutsche börse ag has an
             option whether to settle a beneficiarys claim in cash or shares the company proposed to settle the
             2011 tranche claims due in 2014 in cash a cash settlement obligation exists for claims relating to the
             stock bonus of the executive board since the 2010 tranche and the stock plan for the executive board
