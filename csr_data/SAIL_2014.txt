energy and climate change
energy security can only come about by sincerely addressing the efficient consumption of fuel in the steel
industry energy cost constitutes almost 40 of the total cost of production in view of the high cost of energy
sail has undertaken various measures like optimisation and improvement of existing technologies
introduction of new technologies etc resulting in the decrease of specific energy consumption from 6806
gcaltcs to 6678 gcaltcs during the last 3 years the lowest ever coke rate at 512 kgthm was achieved this
year with an improvement of 1 over last year this is possible primarily because of higher usage of coal dust
injection at 54 kgthm as compared to 51 kgthm achieved last year

2025 by the year 2020 napcc envisages a sustainable future for the country through multipronged actions
ranging from energy efficiency to forest conservation to greater share of energy from renewable sources a
concerted transition to alternative cleaner energy sources is essential to address the issues of climate change

reduction
the combustion of fossil fuels like coal furnace oil and other petroleum and coal based products at various
process units results in emission of green house gases mainly carbon dioxide various functional units of sail
which contribute to the emission of co2 are coke ovens sinter plant blast furnace steel melting shop mills
power plant and other auxiliary shops the other indirect relevant greenhouse gas emissions are
      emissions during transportation of raw materials from captive mines and other sources
      emissions during transportation of products to customers

for maintaining and enhancing increased production capacity sail plants have adopted suitable water
management strategies to preserve this important resource assessment of the discharged water from various
units is carried out to identify areas that need improvement to reduce consumption of fresh makeup water the
maximum amount of water at production sites is used in process cooling scrubbing flue gases and downstream
rolling mills the main sources for industrial and domestic purposes at sail steel plants are regional surface
waters and units are strategically located near to perennial water sources the withdrawal of water does not
affect the sources

various measures like increased recycling installation of recirculation systems maximizing reuse of treated
water upgradation of water systems and control of leakages have resulted in making sail steel plants more
water efficient the specific water consumption decreased from 406 m3tcs to 373 m3tcs over the last three
years a reduction of 81


initiatives taken during the year to reduce fresh water consumption include
    the recycling of effluent from 30 mld sewage recycling plant started from may 2012 at bsp
    water foot print studies at bsp
    implementation of system for recirculation of rim spray water at wheel  axle plant at dsp
    renovation of gas seal water line at new sinter plant at dsp
    renovation of makeup water line at 16 mt cooling tower at coke ovens at dsp
    plugging of leakages of various pipelines at rsp
    action initiated for installation of rain water harvesting system at crmii complex at bsl
    rain water harvesting schemes in various units at ssp
    recirculation of blast furnace etp clarified water back in the system at visl


sail plants have planned and initiated various water conservation activities with an ultimate objective to
achieve zero water discharge during the period 201213 out of approximately 213 million cubic meters of
industrial makeup water withdrawn approximately 58  was recycled back to the process

or sent for disposal to state pollution control board authorised common hazardous waste storage treatment

internationally

to reduce the pollution due to vehicular movement the company uses rail transportation for movement of raw
materials from mines collieries and other manufacturing units thereby reducing roads transportation and its
carbon footprint conveyors are used for the movement of raw materials inside manufacturing facilities
wherever road transportation is employed particularly for movement to railheads the use of covered vehicles
reduces dust pollution

responsible corporate citizenship

since its inception in 1973 sail has been playing a pioneer role in the area of corporate social responsibility
csr the concept of socioeconomic development of the neighbourhoods and communities has been
introduced in sail much before corporate social responsibility became a buzzword with an objective to
plough prosperity back into the environment from where strengths emanate primarily to minimize inequalities
by providing quality education healthcare infrastructure and employment avenues to all to ensure that man
and nature live in harmony to preserve the originality and beauty of indian culture while simultaneously
promoting scientific temperament and modern technology the companys business philosophy encompasses a
triple bottom line approach

sails social objective is synonymous with csr apart from the core business company aims to conduct
business in ways that produce social environmental and economic benefits to the communities in which it
operates and with this underlying philosophy and a credo to make a meaningful difference in peoples lives
sail has been structuring and implementing csr initiatives right from the inception these efforts have seen the
obscure villages of past where sail plants are located turn into modern town presently

initially csr initiatives were carried out in and around steel township and mines and gradually extended to far
flung locations across the country in the area of village development including development of model steel
villages msvs providing medical and health care immunisation ante and post natal care education
access to water facilities construction and repair of roads road side drains  street lights environmental
initiatives women empowerment assistance to people with disabilities sustainable income generation
through self help groups promotion of sports art culture  recreational activities preservation of national
heritage etc

for carrying out social responsibilities a portion of annual profit after tax pat is earmarked every year in line
with dpe guidelines on csr  sustainability additionally expenditure to the tune of rs 2 billion annually is
also incurred on nonsail people living in and around the plantunit locationtownships on account of health
education etc the facilities created in the steel townships at plantsunits locations are being used by the local
non  sail population either free of cost or at a very nominal cost a brief of csr initiatives are summarised
hereunder

healthcare this initiative is crucial for generating a positive atmosphere amongst the community which in turn
maintains the overall performance of the organization sail has taken cognizance of this and has been closely
involved in ensuring the wellbeing of community members by establishing primary health centers hospitals
superspecialty hospitals and reproductive  child health centers to provide specialized and basic healthcare
to more than 34 million so far people living in the vicinity of its plants and units
