    of comprehensive income

in order to harmonize the accounting treatment of taxes and duties on sales across the group a decision was
taken in 2016 to reclassify the accumulated taxes and duties of 1290 million krw from selling and administration
costs into cost of sales for the same period 2015 the amount of taxes and duties is total 1401 million krw
this leads to higher costs of sales and lower gross profit as well as lower selling and administration costs
in the previous year operating profit and other positions in the statement of comprehensive income are not
impacted net profit and earnings per share remain unchanged

there has been a change in the booking method of foreign currency translation gains and losses within the
operational income and expense and financial income and expense beginning with the second quarter 2016 the
prior year reclassification within the operational income and expense amounts to 21202 million krw for the

million krw for 2015 the reclassifications have no impact on ebit and other positions in the statement of
comprehensive income net profit and earnings per share remain unchanged


    business combinations and goodwill
25	
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method the cost of an acquisition is measured
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of
any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree for each business combination the acquirer measures the non
controlling interest in the acquiree  either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable
net assets acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses

in business combinations achieved in stages any previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured
to its acquisition date fair value

any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognized at fair value at the acquisition
date subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or
liability will be recognized in profit or loss
                                                                                                                             financial statements




goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the
amount recognized for noncontrolling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
if this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is
recognized in profit or loss




                                                                                                                            127

                             after initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses for the purpose
                             of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to
                             each of the groups cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the combination irrespective of
                             whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units

                             joint ventures

                             a joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement
                             have rights to the net assets of the joint venture joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of
                             an arrangement which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of
                             the parties sharing control the considerations made in determining joint control are similar to those necessary
                             to determine control over subsidiaries

                             the groups investments in its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method under the equity
                             method the investment in a joint venture is initially recognized at cost the carrying amount of the investment is
                             adjusted to recognize changes in the groups share of net assets of the joint venture since the acquisition date

                             the statement of profit or loss reflects the groups share of the results of operations of the joint venture any
                             change in oci of those investees is presented as part of the groups oci in addition when there has been
                             a change recognized directly in the equity of a joint venture the group recognizes its share of any changes
                             when applicable in the statement of changes in equity unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions
                             between the group and the joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the joint venture

                             the aggregate of the groups share of profit or loss in a joint venture is shown on the face of the statement of
                             profit or loss outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and noncontrolling interests in
                             the subsidiaries of the joint venture

                             the financial statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the group when
                             necessary adjustments are made to align the accounting policies with those of the group

                             at each reporting date the group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the
                             joint venture is impaired if there is such evidence the group calculates the amount of impairment as the
                             difference between the recoverable amount of the joint venture and its carrying value it then recognizes the
                             loss as share of profit of a joint venture in the statement of profit

                             upon loss of significant influence over the joint venture the group measures and recognizes any retained
                             investment at its fair value any difference between the carrying amount of the joint venture  upon loss of
                             significant influence or joint control  and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal
                             is recognized in profit or loss

                             joint operations

                             a joint operation is defined as an arrangement in which the parties with joint control have rights to the assets
                             and obligations for the liabilities relating to that arrangement in respect of its interest in a joint operation a

                             the considerations made in determining joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over

currency rates prevailing at the date of the transaction monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date non
monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rates as of the dates of the initial transactions nonmonetary items measured at fair value in a foreign
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined

the assets including goodwill and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is other
than the korean won are translated using the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period while the
statements of income are translated using average exchange rates during the period differences arising from
such translations are recognized within equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal
of the foreign subsidiary is recognized

                             intangible assets with useful finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment
                             whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired the amortization period and the
                             amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each

                             benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method as appropriate
                             and are treated as changes in accounting estimates the amortization expense on intangible assets with finite
                             lives is recognized in the income statement under cost of sales selling and administration costs in the expense

                             tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cashgenerating unit level the assessment of
                             indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable if not
                             the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis

                             gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the
                             net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the income statement when

                             the determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the
                             arrangement at inception date whether fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific
                             asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset even if that right is not explicitly specified
                             in an arrangement


                             group as a lessee
songwon annual report 2016




                             finance leases which transfer substantially to the group all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of
                             the leased item are capitalized at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or if
                             lower at the present value of the minimum lease payments lease payments are apportioned between finance
                             charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance
                             of the liability finance charges are recognized in finance costs in the income statement




   130

a leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset however if there is no reasonable certainty that
the group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term the asset is depreciated over the shorter of its
estimated useful life and the lease term

operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense in the income statement on a straightline
basis over the lease term


group as a lessor

leases in which the group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset
are classified as operating leases initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to
the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income
contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the period in which they are earned the group has not entered
into finance lease agreements as a lessor


     impairment of nonfinancial assets
212	
the group reviews nonfinancial assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if any indication exists or when annual impairment
testing for assets such as membership is required the group estimates the assets recoverable amount
recoverability of assets is measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the recoverable
amount which is the higher of the assets value in use and its fair value less costs to sell if assets do not generate
cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets the impairment test
is not performed at an individual asset level instead it is performed at the level of the cashgenerating unit
cgu that the asset belongs to

where the carrying amount of an asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired
and is written down to its recoverable amount in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset in determining fair value less costs to sell recent
market transactions are taken into account if available if no such transactions can be identified an appropriate
valuation model is used

for assets excluding goodwill an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication
that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased if such an indication
exists the group estimates the asset or cashgenerating units recoverable amount a previously recognized
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets
recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized the reversal is limited so that the carrying
amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount nor exceed the carrying amount that would have
been determined net of depreciation had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years
such a reversal is recognized in the income statement

the following criteria are also applied in assessing impairment of specific assets


goodwill

goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of december 31 as well as whenever there are events or changes
                                                                                                                            financial statements




in circumstances triggering events which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable goodwill
is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses




                                                                                                                           131

                             for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the groups of
                             cashgenerating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination if the carrying
                             amount of the cashgenerating units to which the goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount an
                             impairment loss on goodwill is recognized the recoverable amount is the higher of the cashgenerating units
                             fair value less costs to sell and its value in use impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in
                             future periods


                             intangible assets with indefinite useful lives

                             intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually as of december 31 either
                             individually or at the cashgenerating unit level as appropriate and when circumstances indicate that the
                             carrying value may be impaired


                             213 borrowing costs
                             borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of an asset that accordingly
                             require a substantial time period to prepare for their intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of
                             the respective assets


                             214 inventories
                             inventory is valued at the lower of the acquisition or production cost and net realizable value cost being
                             generally determined on the basis of a weighted average production costs comprise direct material labor and
                             applicable manufacturing overheads including depreciation charges based on normal operating capacity net
                             realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of
                             completion and selling expenses

215	cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks as well as on hand
and shortterm deposits with a maturity of three months or less


216 provisions
a provision is recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past
event it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation if the effect is material provisions are recognized at
present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money


217	pensions and other longterm employment benefits
pensions

the group operates three defined benefit pension plans one in korea one in switzerland and one in india the
cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method

remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses the effect of the asset ceiling excluding net interest
and the return on plan assets excluding net interest are recognized immediately in the statement of financial
position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through oci in the period in which they occur
remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods

past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of

	the date of the plan amendment or curtailment
	the date that the group recognizes restructuringrelated costs

net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset the pension
expenses are recognized in the income statement under cost of sales and selling and administration costs


other longterm employment benefits

the parent company also implements a bonus plan based on a prescribed quantity of gold and entitling
compensated vacation to longterm employees the bonus plan accounting policies are mostly the same as
the defined benefit plan except that remeasurements are recognized immediately in profit or loss


218 taxes
current income tax

current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities the tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount
are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the group
                                                                                                                       financial statements

                             deferred tax

                             deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the
                             tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes

                             deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except

                             	where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in
                                a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the
                                accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss
                             	in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries associates and
                                interests in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled
                                and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future

                             deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences the carry forward of unused tax
                             credits and unused tax losses is to the extent of the probability that taxable profit will be available against
                             which the deductible temporary differences the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses
                             can be utilized except

                             	where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition
                                of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction
                                affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss
                             	in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries associates and
                                interests in joint ventures deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the
                                temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which
                                the temporary differences can be utilized

                             the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it
                             is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset
                             to be utilized unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the
                             extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered

                             deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when
                             the asset is realized or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or
                             substantively enacted at the reporting date

                             deferred tax relating to items recognized outside profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss deferred
                             tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income
                             or directly in equity

                             deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current
                             tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and
                             the same taxation authority

songwon annual report 2016




                             revenue is recognized to the extent of the probability that the economic benefits will flow to the group and
                             the revenue can be reliably measured revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received
                             or receivable taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty the
                             following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognized


                             sale of goods

                             revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
                             have passed to the buyer

interest income

for all financial instruments measured at amortized cost and interestbearing financial assets classified as
available for sale interest income or expense is recorded using the effective interest rate eir which is the
rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the
financial instrument or a shorter period where appropriate to the net carrying amount of the financial asset
or liability interest income is included in finance income in the income statement


rental income

rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straightline basis
over the lease terms and included in revenue due to its operating nature


dividends

revenue is recognized when the groups right to receive the payment is established


220 financial instruments
a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability
or equity instrument of another entity


financial assets

all financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus in the case of investments not at fair value through
profit or loss directly attributable transaction costs apply purchases or sales of financial assets that require
delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace regular way
trades are recognized on the trade date ie the date that the group commits to purchase or sell the asset

the subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as follows
	at fair value through profit or loss
	held to maturity
	loans and receivables
	all other financial assets are classified as availableforsale

the group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition


financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets
designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss financial assets are classified as held for
trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term this category includes
derivative financial instruments entered into by the group that are not designated as hedging instruments in
hedge relationships as defined by kifrs 1039 derivatives including separated embedded derivatives are also
classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments financial assets at
                                                                                                                          financial statements




fair value through profit and loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes
in fair value recognized in finance income or finance costs in the income statement

the group has not designated any financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss

                             loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
                             quoted in an active market after initial measurement such financial assets are subsequently measured at
                             amortized cost using the effective interest rate method eir less impairment amortized cost is calculated
                             by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of
                             the eir the eir amortization is included in finance income in the income statement the losses arising from
                             impairment are recognized in the income statement in finance costs

                             nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as
                             heldtomaturity when the group has the positive intention and ability to hold it to maturity after initial
                             measurement heldtomaturity investments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method
                             less impairment as for loans and receivables above the eir amortization is included in finance income in the
                             income statement the losses arising from impairment are recognized in the income statement in finance costs

                             profit or loss debt securities in this category are those which are intended to be held for an indefinite period of
                             time and which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or in response to changes in the market conditions

                             after initial measurement availableforsale financial investments are subsequently measured at fair value
                             with unrealized gains or losses recognized as other comprehensive income in the availableforsale reserve
                             until the investment is derecognized at which time the cumulative gain or loss is recognized in other income
                             or determined to be impaired at which time the cumulative loss is reclassified to the income statement in
                             finance costs and removed from the availableforsale reserve


                             derecognition of financial assets

                             a financial asset or where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets
                             is derecognized when

                             and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the group has
                             retained continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured
                             at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the

impairment of financial assets

further disclosures relating to impairment of financial assets are also provided in the following notes

	note 3 significant accounting judgments estimates and assumptions
	note 14 trade and other receivables

the group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a
group of financial assets is impaired an impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the
initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of
the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated evidence of impairment may
include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty default
or delinquency in interest or principal payments the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial
reorganization and observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash
flows such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults


financial assets carried at amortized cost

for financial assets carried at amortized cost the group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment
exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant or collectively for financial assets that
are not individually significant if the group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an
individually assessed financial asset whether significant or not it includes the asset in a group of financial
assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment assets that are
individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are
not included in a collective assessment of impairment


availableforsale financial investments

in the case of equity investments objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the
fair value of the investment below its cost  a significant decline is evaluated against the original cost of the
investment and a prolonged decline against the period in which the fair value has been below its original
cost in the case of debt instruments impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as financial assets
carried at amortized cost however the amount recorded for impairment is the cumulative loss measured as the
difference between the amortized cost and the current fair value less any impairment loss on that investment
previously recognized in the income statement


financial liabilities

all financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings including
directly attributable transaction costs the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification
as follows

	financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

                             or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified such an exchange or modification is treated as a
                             derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability and the difference in the respective
                             carrying amounts is recognized in the income statement

                             instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and
                             are subsequently remeasured at fair value derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is
                             positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative


                             cash flow hedges

221	new and amended standards and interpretations
the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following
amendments to kifrs effective as of january 1 2016 and as adopted by the group


kifrs 1114 regulatory deferral accounts

kifrs 1114 is an optional standard that allows an entity whose activities are subject to rate regulation to
continue applying most of its existing accounting policies for regulatory deferral account balances upon its
firsttime adoption of kifrs entities that adopt kifrs 1114 must present the regulatory deferral accounts as
separate line items on the statement of financial position and present movements in these account balances
as separate line items in the statement of profit or loss and oci the standard requires disclosure of the nature
of and risks associated with the entitys rate regulation and the effects of that rate regulation on its financial
statements since the group is an existing kifrs preparer and is not involved in any rateregulated activities
this standard does not apply


amendments to kifrs 1111 joint arrangements accounting for acquisitions of interests

the amendments to kifrs 1111 require that a joint operator accounting for the acquisition of an interest in
a joint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business must apply the relevant
kifrs 1103 principles for business combinations accounting the amendments also clarify that a previously
held interest in a joint operation is not remeasured on the acquisition of an additional interest in the same joint
operation while joint control is retained in addition scope exclusion has been added to kifrs 1111 to specify
that the amendments do not apply when the parties sharing joint control including the reporting entity are
under common control of the same ultimate controlling party the amendments apply to both the acquisition of
the initial interest in a joint operation and the acquisition of any additional interests in the same joint operation

a joint operation during the period


amendments to kifrs 1016 and kifrs 1038 clarification of acceptable methods of
depreciation and amortization
the amendments clarify the principle in kifrs 1016 and kifrs 1038 that revenue reflects a pattern of
economic benefits that are generated from operating a business of which the asset is part rather than the
economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset as a result a revenuebased method cannot
be used to depreciate property plant and equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances to
amortize intangible assets the amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or
                                                                                                                          financial statements

                             will be measured under kifrs 1016 at accumulated cost before maturity and using either the cost model

become effective


kifrs 1109 financial instruments

the kasb issued the final version of kifrs 1109 financial instruments that replaces kifrs 1039 financial
instruments recognition and measurement and all previous versions kifrs 1109 brings together all three
aspects of the accounting for financial instruments project classification and measurement impairment
and hedge accounting kifrs 1109 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2018 with
early application permitted except for hedge accounting retrospective application is required but providing
comparative information is not compulsory for hedge accounting the requirements are generally applied
prospectively with some limited exceptions the group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective
date the impact on its consolidated financial statements is as follows

in connection with the adoption of kifrs 1109 the group has not yet undertaken any update on its internal
control processes or a change in the accounting system related to the reporting of financial instruments and
has not been able to analyze the financial impact of the new standard on the financial statements however
the general impacts on the financial statements are as follows

1 financial asset classification and measurement

the new kifrs 1109 requires a financial instrument to be classified and measured subsequently at amortized
cost fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci or fair value through profit or loss fvtpl on the
basis of the holders business model and instruments contractual cash flow characteristics as shown below
the requirements should be applied to an entire financial asset even if it contains an embedded derivative
that is in contrast with the requirements of kifrs 1039 a derivative embedded within a hybrid combined
contract containing a financial asset host is not accounted for separately

                                                                  contractual cash flow characteristics
                                                            composed solely of principal
                                                                                                for other cases
business model                                                    and interest
purpose of collecting contractual cash flows               measured at amortized cost 1
purpose of collecting and selling contractual cash flows       measured at fvoci 1        measured at fvtpl 2
purpose of selling others                                      measured at fvtpl

1 can be designated at fvtpl in order to get rid of or reduce accounting mismatch cannot cancel
2 can be designated at fvoci in case of equity securities not for heldfortrading purpose cannot cancel

the requirements in kifrs 1109 to classify financial assets measured at amortized costs or at fvoci are
stricter than kifrs 1039 and thus the proportion of financial assets measured at fvtpl may increase which
may lead to a rise in profit or loss volatility at the adoption of kifrs 1109
                                                                                                                       financial statements




                                                                                                                      143

                             2 financial liabilities classification and measurement

                             in kifrs 1109 fair value changes of financial liabilities at fvtpl attributable to changes in credit risk of the
                             liability shall be presented in other comprehensive income not in profit or loss amounts presented in other
                             comprehensive income shall not be subsequently transferred to profit or loss however the new standard
                             allows the recognition of the full amount of changes in the fair value in profit or loss only if the presentation of
                             the changes in the liabilitys credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting
                             mismatch in profit or loss

                             the fair value changes of financial liabilities designated at fvtpl that were previously recognized as profit or
                             loss in kifrs 1039 will partially be recorded as other comprehensive income and thus profit or loss related to
                             the evaluation of financial liabilities may decrease

                             3 impairment financial assets and contract assets

                             in kifrs 1039 impairment is recognized only when there is objective evidence of impairment based on the
                             incurred loss model in the new kifrs 1109 impairment of debt instruments lease bonds contract assets
                             loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts that are measured at amortized costs or at fvoci is
                             recognized based on the expected credit loss ecl impairment model

                             kifrs 1109 outlines a threestage model for impairment based on changes in credit risk since initial recognition
                             loss allowance is measured based on the 12month ecl or lifetime ecl which allows early recognition of
                             credit loss compared to the incurred loss model of kifrs 1039

                                       classification                                    loss allowance

                                                                                         reporting date

                             stage 2   assets with significant increase in credit risk
                                       since initial recognition                         lifetime ecl expected credit losses that result from
                                                                                         all possible default events over the expected life of the

                             1 low credit risk at the end of reporting period may be considered as no significant increase in credit risk
                             in kifrs 1109 only the accumulated changes in the lifetime ecl after initial recognition are taken into account
                             as loss allowance in case credit is impaired at initial recognition of financial assets

                             4 hedge accounting

                             the new kifrs 1109 maintains mechanics of hedge accounting fair value hedge cash flow hedge overseas
                             operations net investment hedge as set forth in kifrs 1039 however unlike requirements in kifrs 1039
                             that are too complex and strict kifrs 1109 is more practical principlebased and less strict and focuses on
                             the entitys risk management activities also kifrs 1109 allows broader range of hedged items and hedging
                             instruments under kifrs 1039 a hedge is assessed to be highly effective only if the offset is in the range of 80
                             125 percentage by performing numerical test of effectiveness in kifrs 1109 such requirements are alleviated
                             transactions not qualifying for hedge accounting requirements of kifrs 1039 may now qualify for hedge

                             accounting under kifrs 1109 resulting in less volatility in profit or loss


                             kifrs 1115 revenue from contracts with customers

                             kifrs 1115 establishes a fivestep model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers under
                             kifrs 1115 revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects
                             to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer the new revenue standard will
                             supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under kifrs


   144

either a full retrospective application or a modified retrospective application is required for annual periods
beginning on or after january 1 2018 early adoption is permitted the group plans to adopt the new standard
on the required effective date using the modified retrospective method during 2016 the group performed a
preliminary assessment of kifrs 1115 which is subject to changes arising from a more detailed ongoing analysis

the new standard kifrs 1115 applies to all revenue arising from contracts with customers and replaces
kifrs 1011 construction contracts kifrs 1018 revenue kifrs 2113 customer loyalty programmes and
relevant interpretations

the principles in kifrs 1115 are applied using the following five steps
1	identify the contracts with a customer
2	identify the performance obligations in the contract
3	determine the transaction price
4	allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
5	recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation

as at december 31 2016 the group has not yet undertaken any update on its internal control processes or a
change in the accounting system in relation to the adoption of kifrs 1115 and has not been able to analyze
the impact of the adoption of kifrs on the financial statements the group will be analyzing the financial
impact of the adoption of kifrs 1115 by the end of the 3rd quarter of 2017 and disclose the results in the
notes to the financial statements for the 3rd quarter of 2017 the general impacts on the groups consolidated
financial statements are as follows


amendments to kifrs 1007 statement of cash flows disclosure initiative

the amendments to kifrs 1007 statement of cash flows are part of the iasbs disclosure initiative and require
an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities
arising from financing activities including both changes arising from cash flows and noncash changes on
initial application of the amendment entities are not required to provide comparative information for preceding
periods these amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2017 with early
application permitted application of the amendments will result in additional disclosures provided by the group


amendments to kifrs 1012 recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses

the amendments clarify that an entity needs to consider whether tax law restricts the sources of taxable profits
against which it may make deductions on the reversal of that deductible temporary difference furthermore
the amendments provide guidance on how an entity should determine future taxable profits and explain the
circumstances in which taxable profit may include the recovery of some assets for more than their carrying
amount entities are required to apply the amendments retrospectively however on initial application of the
amendments the change in the opening equity of the earliest comparative period may be recognized in the
opening retained earnings or in another component of equity as appropriate without allocating the change
between opening retained earnings and other components of equity entities applying this relief must disclose
that fact these amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2017 with early
application permitted if an entity applies the amendments for an earlier period it must disclose that fact these
amendments are not expected to have any impact on the group

impairment on availableforsale financial investments

for availableforsale financial investments the group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective
evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired in the case of equity investments classified
as availableforsale objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the
investment below its cost

based on these criteria the group did not identify any impairment on availableforsale investments as of
december 31 2016 and 2015

the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could
be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale

the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values

	cash and cash equivalent trade receivables other receivables trade payables and other current liabilities
   approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments

	fair value of availableforsale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets
   if available

	fair value of unquoted availableforsale financial assets is estimated using appropriate valuation techniques

market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because
of changes in market prices market prices comprise two types of risk

	interest rate risk
	foreign currency risk

financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings deposits availableforsale
investments and derivative financial instruments the sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to
the positions at 31 december in 2016 and 2015

interest rate risk

interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because
of changes in market interest rates the groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates
primarily to its interestbearing loans and borrowings as well as bank deposits with floating interest rates

the groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates substantially to its interest
bearing loans and borrowings with floating interest rates which makes the group exposed to cash flows risk
responsively the group is minimizing the risk partially through interest rate swap contracts or choosing the
most favorable financing instruments by switching to the loans with more favorable conditions or improving
the groups credit rating

interest rate sensitivity

the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates the groups
exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the groups interestbearing loans
and borrowings as well as bank deposits with floating interest rates with all other variables held constant
the groups profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows

foreign currency risk

the groups exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to its operating
activities the risk of foreign exchange primarily relates to us dollars usd euro eur swiss francs chf
japanese yen jpy chinese yuan renminbi cny united arab emirates dirham aed and to indian rupee
inr

foreign exchange risks arise when commercial transactions recognized assets or liabilities are denominated
in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency
                                                                                                                            financial statements




the objective of the management of foreign currency risk is to maximize the value of the firm through minimizing
the fluctuation of net profit and uncertainty arising from the fluctuation in foreign currency to accomplish
this the group uses a strategy to accord the collection terms of receivables and payment terms of payables
denominated in usd considering the similar volume of exports and imports in regard to eur and jpy the
group manages the risk through currency forward contracts

                             for trade receivables and investing activities

                             the group maintains a policy to keep a trade relationship only with customers with a high credit rating assessed
                             by credit assessment considering their financial position past experience of defaults and other indicators of
                             default if a customers credit rating worsens the group sets an individual credit limit on that customer and
                             intensively manages the credit risk in addition the group minimizes the credit risk by maintaining the exposure
                             to the credit risk at an insignificant level through ongoing management including periodical reviews on all the
                             customers

                             in which the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value the exposure to the
                             related credit risk however is relatively restricted because the group maintains relationships with financial
                             institutions with high credit ratings

                             liabilities due to the unfavorable economy of the industry or financial market

                             the group manages its liquidity risk through its own strategy and plans which consider the maturity of financial
                             instruments and expected operating cash flows and include a policy to map out the maturity of financial assets
                             and liabilities
