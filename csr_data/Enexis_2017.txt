connector in the energy chain
we ensure now and in the future that our grids can handle the demand and the supply of
energy and that energy is distributed as efficiently as possible we also facilitate the energy
market for example by making metering data available we also regard it as our role to
connect parties in the energy chain to realise the objectives of the energy agreement
together by working together with the government and market parties we can accelerate the
energy transition

the market in which we work is becoming increasingly dynamic instead of just oneway
traffic there is now twoway traffic in our energy grids

strategic direction
from our core task to ensure a reliable and affordable energy supply we wish to enlarge our
contribution to the transition to a sustainable energy supply this is necessary in order to
realise the objectives of the energy agreement together with partners this is why we have
started a process together with our stakeholders to realign our existing strategy

as a first important step we performed a scenario analysis in 2015 regarding the question
what will the energy supply look like in 2030 and what will enexiss role be in this
this resulted in four future scenarios as a followup to the scenarios analysis we held many
and intensive discussions with internal and external stakeholders the outcomes of this
stakeholder dialogue served as input for determining the strategic direction which demands
an adjustment of our mission and strategic objectives

mission we realise a sustainable energy supply by means of stateoftheart services and grids
and by taking the lead in innovative solutions

strategic objectives
ċċ our grids and services are ready timely for the changes in the energy world
ċċ our energy supply is reliable
ċċ our services are excellent with as a consequences high customer satisfaction and
   lower costs
ċċ we realise together with local partners the dutch targets with regard to the sustainable
   production of energy and energy savings
ċċ we realise innovative scalable solutions that accelerate the transition to a sustainable
   energy supply

in doing so we focus on two main tasks
ċċ excellent grid management by designing our grids in such a manner that they will be able
   to accommodate the increasing sustainability of the energy supply according to experts in
   the market we aim to simplify our processes and systems for customers and employees
   resulting in our services becoming 20 more efficient in 2020 and better aligned with the
   customers wishes of course this may not be at the expense of safety
ċċ accelerating the energy transition by realising innovative scalable solutions for energy
   savings and greening of the energy supply

the strategic plan will be submitted for approval to the general meeting of shareholders in
april 2017 the objectives and presentation in the annual report 2016 are based on the existing
mission and strategy 20142016

our environment
the energy sector is in a state of flux the shift from fossil fuel
to renewable energy the energy transition is accelerating

the netherlands has committed to the energy agreement and to the climate agreements that
were made in paris in december 2015 these agreements have a large impact on both the
supply of energy and the demand for energy and thus on the energy grids a heating system
without natural gas is necessary in order to realise the proposed co2 targets for example for
the construction of energyneutral houses and an alternative heating system such as warm
water with heating grids and heating pumps with sustainably generated electricity other
promising developments are biogas electric transport and storage systems for electricity

dutch people are becoming more and enthusiastic about the energy transition this can be
deduced from the increasing number of energy cooperatives solar panels for retail customers
and service providers the number of households that have switched energy supplier has
increased as well switching contributes to lower energy costs for households as a result of
the energy transition we see that the energy system is changing from oneway energy to
twoway energy and data this is reflected in for instance
ċċ decentralisation smallscale energy production solar and wind feeding into the grid in
   many locations
ċċ diversification regional and optimal mix of electricity gas and heating
ċċ democratisation making more own choices influence is shifting to end users and there are
   growing number of energy cooperatives

we consider the quality of our work important in order to gauge the quality of our work we
compare our performance to that of comparable companies

electricity outage time
the reliability of the energy supply is high in the netherlands this is the case for both gas and
electricity in recent years in particular the electricity outage time of enexis has developed
positively compared to other regional grid operators the graph below shows the annual
outage time per electricity connection due to high medium and low voltage outages in
minutes per connection

employership
with all the changes in connection with the energy transition we demand a lot of our
employees we expect that they are willing to contribute to building the new energy system
and that they take initiatives to improve how we do things in doing so it is our aim to ensure
that our employees find their work energising that they do their work with enthusiasm and
enjoyment and that they carry out their duties to the best of their abilities the extent in
which we succeed in doing this is apparent from the best employers survey

in 2016 enexis achieved a fourth place in the list of best employers in the profit sector with
more than 1000 employees we are proud of this as more than 300 organisations participated
in this survey

absenteeism
the average absenteeism percentage in the netherlands was 39 in 2015 the absenteeism
was slightly higher at enexis in the past year namely 44 we also see this difference
reflected in the absenteeism percentage of the industry and energy sector which amounted
to 45 in 2015 the sector average over 2016 was not yet available at the time of the
publication of this annual report

transparency
transparency with regard to material themes is an important point of departure in our
reporting we are open about our objectives and our performance in order to learn from this
and to enable stakeholders to follow the progress we measure are degree of transparency
using the annual transparency benchmark which is commissioned by the ministry of economic
affairs and is carried out under its responsibility

             the energy
             to change
                                                               peter vermaat ceo and maarten blacquière cfo




energy is taken for granted in the netherlands our employees
are available 24 hours a day for a reliable and safe energy supply
certainly now that energy is becoming increasingly sustainable
and the customers wishes are changing ceo peter vermaat and
cfo maarten blacquière look back on the initiatives in 2016

our most important task is to ensure that all of our customers are always supplied with
energy as companies count on energy to continue to produce schools teach using a
digiboard and we also make extensive use of electrical devices in our households our
customers had no electricity for on average 152 minutes in 2016 that was lower than we had
forecast and lower than the average outage time in the netherlands

now that the dependency on energy is increasing it is important that we carry out our work
excellently at the same time we see that new developments are completely changing our
familiar energy system for instance decentralised sustainable generation by solar panels
electric transport and heating from alternative sources in our grids we see that the supply
and demand of energy are fluctuating more and more in order to ensure that the energy
supply remains reliable and affordable we have to adapt our grid and our services
in doing so we focus on two main tasks excellent grid management and accelerating the
energy transition

excellent grid management
safety is primary in everything that we do as working excellently on the energy supply is only
possible when this takes place safely it is for a very good reason that our safety requirements
for employees and contractors are strict we want every employee to return home safe and
sound every day with safety as the basis we worked on replacing and modernising the
energy grid in 2016 since the merger with grid operator endinet in 2016 we now also do this in


                                                                                        enexis  annual report 2016          16

report on 2016  foreword by the executive board



the eindhoven region we invested eur 384 million in the construction and maintenance of
our grids on the one hand this concerns necessary replacements on the other hand we are
working on making the grid futureproof

our traditional energy grids are becoming smart grids which we service remotely via
automation and with which the outage time can be further shortened part of these smart
grids is the smart meter which has now been installed at over one million households
in the future the meter will form a key element in the balancing of the supply and demand
of energy

accelerating the energy transition
our grids from an important base for the realisation of the energy transition we ensure that
the grid is ready to receive and distribute locally generated energy that is our task however
the speed of changes and uncertainties about what the energy future will look like make our
task complex which investment choices must we make for the energy supply in 2050 how
long and how much will we continue to invest in new natural gas grids now that more and
more municipalities are considering alternatives such as biogas or synthetic gas what will
role will heating play in the energy mix

we discussed the future scenarios the energy transition and the impact that this will have on
enexis with our stakeholders in 2016 we see many new forms of collaboration coming into
being for example between knowledge institutes market parties governments and local
energy cooperatives we also collaborate via enpuls a new company that we established in
2016 together with among others market parties research institutes and municipalities we
are working on scalable solutions for sustainable regional development flexibility energy
savings and sustainable mobility in this manner we make innovation feasible and new
applications are realised faster

being prepared for uncertainty
it is important that we as a company learn to deal with the uncertainties accompanying the
energy transition we started a process in 2016 to realign our existing strategy so that we are
better prepared for future developments we have to become more agile and we have to be
open to new concepts as the energy system of the future is flexible and accessible for
everyone in this process we seek to maintain the right balance between customer tariffs
operating result and investments

the energy of our employees is vital in order to fulfil our duties towards society they know
what the energy transition demands from us and our committed to help customers and to
improve processes in 2017 we will continue energetically with our employees and our
stakeholders to follow the path that we have chosen

report on 2016  safety




         what it really is all about
         is the work culture           i dont want to experience it ever again that somebody has an accident under my responsibility
                                        i experienced this once and i hope i will never have to deal with something like that again i often
                                        tell my personal story to colleagues to emphasise how vital working safely is at bam we have all
                                        sorts of registrations international safety days apps a reporting number for incidents and such
                                        but this is no guarantee for success what it really is all about is the work culture do coworkers
                                        feel free to call each other to account do they dare to make choices in the interest of safety
                                        when doing their work this leads to dilemmas every day and we talk about these seriously and
                                        also in a more lighthearted way in the past year we have transformed our instrumental safety
                                        approach into an approach from the heart we are therefore very proud that we won the enexis
                                        contractor safety award 2016 apparently it is noticeable that we are on the right track to make
                                        our safety culture more open and transparent the award is a confirmation for our employees
                                        what we aim for together with enexis is that the discussion about safety is not carried out from
                                        a position of authority but based on a personal relationship between client and contractor
                                        between contractors among each other and above all between employees

                                       each incident is one too many i know that nevertheless the trend in our safety figures can
                                        be called good it is the result of structural improvements what we do in particular is provide
                                        the opportunity to talk about incidents how could it occur we are sympathetic and strict
                                        when discussing incidents we understand that safety measures can be a nuisance but we do
                                        not accept it when the required safety measures are not taken in the long term our safety
                                        performance could be even better we will maintain our safety approach and the energy that
                                        we put into it with more attention for dialogue and discipline

report on 2016  safety




safety
working with gas or electricity is never without risk this is
why working safely has the highest priority for us we pay
attention to the safety of bystanders and we want every
employee to return home safe and sound every day the
protection of the data and privacy of customers is another
important aspect of safety

safety of employees
we formulated robust ambitions for the safety of our employees in 2013 we want the
number of accidents to decrease every year we measure this with the dartrate the number
of accidents resulting in absenteeism per 200000 hours worked our target in 2016 was a
dartrate of  032 our score was 017 at the end of 2016 seven accidents with absenteeism
occurred this still amounted to 13 in 2015

                                                                                           2016           2015           2014         20133         20123

1 dartrate the dartrate stands for the number of accidents resulting in absence from work or adapted work per 200000 working hours
2 figures do not include endinet
3 comparative figures 2012 and 2013 were adjusted in view of the changed definition in 2014 whereby accidents with adapted work were no longer included



enexiss dartrate shows a strongly downward trend especially a stronger focus on safety and
safety awareness play an important role in this our employees always have to be aware of the
risks when carrying out their work and to point possible dangers out to each other we
carried out an internal campaign in 2016 which encouraged employees to consider their daily
work and the risks involved

the safety of our own employees is just as important for us as the safety of the employees of
contractors who work for us they are also subject to strict safety requirements and we help
to improve the safety our external parties reported 14 accidents with absenteeism in 2016
the dartrate for third parties was 086 and shows a somewhat more fluctuating trend this
could be due to the fact that we encourage parties to report incidents better we received
more reports and the quality of the reports was better which increases our insight the safety
at contractors is one of our spear points in 2017 we will enter into a dialogue participate
more often in incident investigations and share information about safety

safety awareness must be rewarded this is why we award our hse awards every year both
internally and externally in 2016 the enexis contractor safety award went to bam zuid the
contractor with the best performance in the field of safety health wellbeing and the
environment internally the hse award went to colleague klaas kleinman who together with
other emergency response colleagues provides for a safer environment at our work locations

report on 2016  safety



safety and our environment
incidents in the gas grid are also monitored closely as these can form a direct hazard for
public safety in the first half of 2016 we observed an increasing number of reports of gas
leaks with a negligible or small effect in gas meter installations in order to determine the
cause of this enexis started a detailed investigation of which the outcomes are expected in
2017 in order to prevent leakages we also introduced a multiyear programme for the
replacement of obsolete connection pipelines

 ċċ disastrous impact accidents with one or several fatalities or damage to the environment of at least eur 10 million
 1   excluding endinet


privacy
another aspect of safety is privacy with the fast growing attention for open data the
importance of protecting privacy is increasing this is why we are constantly working on our
privacy and security policy transparency and an adequate communication about the use of
data play an important role in this we appointed a privacy officer in 2016 to advise the
internal organisation on privacy matters and to prepare the implementation of the european
privacy directive we are working on improving our authorisation management we carry out
penetration tests and hackers tests periodically and we carried out security scanning
the reporting desk data leaks was also formalised in 2016

an important data leak in the energy sector was discovered in 2016 the energy data of
2 million dutch households was taken from a central register for commercial purposes
the data leak was reported directly to the netherlands authority for consumers  market
and the dutch data protection authority grid operators are also working on joint plan of
action via the sector organisation netbeheer nederland to reduce the risk of unlawful use of
customer data the monitoring on the central register had been intensified and it is checked
on a daily basis whether no irregular queries are being made

cyber security
the security of computerisation in the energy grids the smart meter and our information
systems is a constant point of attention with a high priority if hackers obtain unauthorised
access to our systems this can lead to disturbances andor data leaks we are constantly
developing and implementing improvements together with external knowledge partners and
suppliers in addition we work together with the national cyber security centre of the dutch
ministry of security and justice other grid operator and market parties to take measures

report on 2016  reliability of the energy supply




  we are rather spoiled in the netherlands with a high reliability of energy and many customers
   are probably not even aware what actually has to be done to achieve this certainly now that
   energy is being produced in more and more locations it is a challenge for grid operators to
   ensure that the energy supply continues to remain reliable greenchoice stimulates customers
   to generate their own electricity or to join local energy collectives we focus on the local
   energy transition and we like working together in this area with grid operators for example
   to increase sustainability on a neighbourhood or city level and to keep costs under control
   both parties have their own role in this and have to also take on their roles although the
   discussion about our division of roles is sometimes polemic i advocate arriving at the best
   solution for society by working together as we ultimately have one common objective
   increasing the sustainability of the energy supply with the same high degree of reliability

  we spend a lot of attention and money on maintaining the high reliability level of our
   electricity grids we monitor everything very closely and that is bearing fruit however it is
   more difficult to remain at the top than to reach the top we are facing two major challenges
   getting the grid ready for the future and ensuring the performance of the ageing grids
   this is why we are actively working on smart solutions to facilitate the energy transition in
   a costeffective manner in order to identify weak spots in the grid before these lead to
   outages we make use of the smart cable guard system we are constantly working on
   optimising our maintenance and replacement programmes and when an outage occurs
   we try to solve this as quickly as possible for example by installing distribution automation
   in this manner we aim to make optimal use of our grids                                          we are rather spoiled

reliability of the
energy supply
it is important for our customers that electricity and gas are
available every moment an outage is a nuisance and can also
cost companies money fortunately energy was available in the
past year 9999 of the time
the energy supply in the netherlands is very reliable compared with other countries
however sometimes something still goes wrong in 2016 our customers were without
electricity for 152 minutes and without gas for 45 seconds the outage for electricity was
lower than our target of no more than 224 minutes but higher than in 2015 the outage time
of 142 minutes in 2015 was historically low

                                                                                            electricity                   gas

an important share of the electricity outages were caused by excavation work therefore
since a number of years we are paying extra attention to the prevention of excavation
damage as damage to gas pipelines can have disastrous consequences based on the
information requests that we receive from excavators we gauge whether their excavation
work entails risks for our cables and pipelines if that is the case we contact the excavator by
telephone to point out the necessity of taking care when excavating our employees also visit
excavation sites when an excavator encounters an unexpected situation and contacts us we
quickly go to the location to find a solution together the manner in which we prevent
excavation damage contributes to our high reliability

investing in a reliable energy grid
in order to ensure that the grid remains reliable we invested eur 384 million in 2016 in
maintenance replacement and modernisation of the grids in order to determine which
investments we will or will not do we weigh all of the different interests such as reliability
safety legality affordability customer satisfaction and sustainability via riskbased asset
management the asset management process is iso 55001 certified

dilemma investing in natural gas grids
the reduction of the use of natural gas is one of the points of departure in the energy policy
of the ministry of economic affairs natural gas will no longer play a role in heating systems in
2050 however natural gas will still be needed for the time being in the transition to a
completely co2neutral energy supply it is a dilemma for us how long and how much we must
invest in new natural gas grids the speed in which developments will take place is uncertain
and the role of heating in the energy mix is a matter of debate during the national climate
conference 2016 enexis together with various parties including municipalities signed the
manifests to work with living without natural gas and energy transition at households with
lower incomes we follow the developments participate in pilots with sustainable
alternatives including biogas and enter into a dialogue with stakeholders regarding the need
for alternatives for natural gas the uncertainty of these developments is still large
nevertheless the debate within society about the use of natural gas will provide direction
for our activities in the coming years and laws and regulations will be adapted where
necessary accordingly

smart grids increase reliability
in order to monitor the supply and demand of energy real time and to solve outages quickly
we have added ict to our stations we have been equipping our stations with distribution
automation since 2015 with this we are able to operate our energy grids remotely and solve
outages faster we equipped around 400 stations with distribution automation in 2016 and we
will continue with up to 2020

we also carried out pilots with distribution automation light in 2016 this is a cheaper and
more compact form of distribution automation we use small computers to obtain insight
into current energy flows with this we are preparing for a sustainable and decentralised

energy supply which also includes water pumps solar panels and electric cars the large scale
rollout of distribution automation light will start in 2017 and it is our aim that around 35000
transformer stations will be equipped with this by 2026

creating added value for society through
distribution automation
we started to make our added value for society demonstrable in 2016 by means of a pilot
project with this insight we are better able to steer and to make choices that have an
optimal effect for society

we have started to make an inventory of the effect of distribution automation in enschede
for society the mediumvoltage stations in enschede have been equipped with a small
computer that makes it possible to detect problems and to switch parts of the grid on and
off remotely in the event of an outage we can switch back on the units that are not affected
by the outage remotely so that people in that area are less inconvenienced by an outage
the added value for society of the distribution automation process in enschede is estimated
at eur 1 million based on the costs incurred and the projected benefits these benefits
comprise the avoidance of loss of energy use minutes in the past and future years the
underlying assumptions and points of departure for this calculation can be found on the
enexis group website

insight into the benefits and costs for society can be used for future investment decisions
this first impact calculation is in that sense a next step in integrated thinking within enexis
whereby we aim for the optimisation of benefits for society as a basis for investments in
enexiss riskbased asset management policy

report on 2016  increasing the sustainability of the energy supply




increasing the
sustainability of the
energy supply
we see the wish to increase sustainability among our
stakeholders from consumers and local energy companies to
municipalities we are pleased to provide support and assistance
with this we take our social responsibility seriously and we
contribute to the realisation of the energy agreement and the
international climate agreements that were made in paris

more and more customers are delivering energy back to enexis that they generate themselves
from the sun and wind the share of sustainable energy that we transmit is thus becoming
larger and larger

helping customers to save energy and increase
sustainability
the netherlands aims to realise energy savings of 15 per year enpuls helps to realise these
agreements laid down in the energy agreement by stimulating customers to save energy
themselves for example through our programme buurkracht we put together teams of
motivated local residents in cooperation with local energy cooperatives the neighbourhood
team enters into consultations with residents on double glazing insulation and solar panels in
the meantime 165 buurkracht neighbourhoods have saved over 13 million kwh electricity and
over 450 tons m3 gas together this is comparable to the energy consumption of around 300
households a year

sixtyfive new neighbourhoods started saving energy together in 2016 and with this we have
achieved our target for 2016 the involvement of volunteers and our own personnel is
essential in order to stimulate local residents to start projects in their neighbourhoods in 2017
as well in the coming year we will focus more on starting new initiatives in the participating
neighbourhoods than on attracting new neighbourhoods

accelerating the energy transition
we wish to further increase our impact to realise the objectives that were laid down in
the energy agreement this is why we have made it our aim to draw up energy plans with
provinces municipalities and housing corporations as from 2017 together we will draw up
a neighbourhood approach for the future infrastructure for the coming ten years with
concrete initiatives for increasing sustainability and energy savings

report on 2016  increasing the sustainability of the energy supply



sustainable regional development
provinces and municipalities have their own sustainability ambitions and needs we wish to
arrive at new solutions via enpuls in consultation with municipalities provinces housing
corporations and local energy collectives enpuls developed a smart heating system at the
business park high tech science park together with electronics company thales and the
province overijssel

flexibility
energy choices of companies and consumers are becoming increasingly important for the
energy system enpuls stimulates market parties to make direct use of energy that is generated
locally or if too much energy is available to store this energy enpuls is developing new
market models and setting up pilots in order to make this attractive such as in the pilot jouw
energiemoment 20 your energy moment 20 whereby it is being examined as from 2016
whether sustainably generated energy from batteries in houses can be traded by customers
we aim to accommodate the expected changes in the energy supply and demand with smart
innovations so that the energy grids do not have to be expanded

sustainable mobility
there are now more than 100000 electric cars on the road in the netherlands and we expect
a further increase in the coming years this provides economic opportunities for the market
however it also has farreaching consequences for the electricity grid peaks in demand can
also occur when too many customers want to charge their batteries at the same time in the
national living lab smart charging studies we examine aspects of smart charging together
with research institutes universities governments grid operators and market parties the
supply of sustainable electricity can be matched with needs of the driver via smart charging
points the netherlands has built up a lot of knowledge about this topic and is contributing
to establishing an international standard

we are also working on applications that regulate the charging of electric cars at the most
sustainable moment when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing as a result maximum
use can be made of sustainable energy these applications can only be realised if people also
make use of a smart charging infrastructure we are realising 2500 smart charging points with
the provinces noordbrabant and limburg

report on 2016  customer satisfaction




                                         we would like to welcome at least five million visitors a year in theme park the efteling in 2020
                                          to this end we regularly open new attractions and we have expanded our bungalow park
                                          bosrijk every day we rely on the delivery reliability of enexis because an electricity outage
                                          interrupts the fairy tale that we wish to offer our guests when we encountered the limits of
                                          the electricity capacity we entered into discussions with enexis our request for expansion was
                                          not standard we took enexis out of its comfort zone but the company demonstrated that it
                                          doesnt only think in products it thinks above all in the customers needs and that is ultimately
                                          what it is all about enexis has the knowledge how the company makes use of this knowledge
                                          for us is not really relevant as long as we can count on sufficient electricity for the future
                                          we are also considering solutions for sustainable energy but with regard to volume and
                                          generation this does not yet correspond with our needs the guests experience is first and
                                          foremost and we will not make any concessions in this regard you will certainly not see

                                         when customers are without electricity or gas they know how to find us fast via social media
                                          our webcare team is ready to assist them on working days we are available between 8 am
        an electricity outage             and 9 pm and as from the fall of 2016 we are also available during the day in the weekend
                                          this is important as customers expect the same speed online as a webshop we try to respond
        interrupts the fairy tale         to a question via twitter or facebook within one hour solving a technical outage sometimes
                                          takes a little longer but we do keep customers informed in the meantime and sometimes we
                                          do something extra when a disappointed family was sitting in the dark on christmas eve

for many companies it is now the case ordered today 
received tomorrow our customer are also making increasingly
higher demands with regard to our services and they expect
speed and convenience it is our challenge to structure customer
processes in such a manner that our services are simple fast and
welltraceable for customers

in order to simplify our services and to identify bottlenecks we ask customer how much
effort they felt was required to receive the help that they wanted we measure their
experiences in the most important customer processes we use the customer effort score
ces to measure this the principle the lower the better therefore applies for the ces score

1 scores do not include endinet
2 scores are cumulative scores

where complaints and claim are concerned we scored better in 2016 than our target our
customer service employees score high on customer friendliness and expertise however
customer still feel that it takes too much effort to find information on our website for
example about outages we are working on improving the timeliness and the speed of the
information and the awareness of the national outage number

unfortunately we did not achieve our objective on the customer effort scores in 2016
therefore the efforts to achieve these objectives are being intensified we started a project
for the redesign of processes and a chainexceeding approach in order to structurally improve
important working procedures within enexis in this project we are focusing on the
management of connections the construction of the primary infrastructure maintenance
outages and market facilitation these processes are being redesigned to work together in a
more customeroriented and efficient manner

smart meter
customers are offered a new energy meter by their grid operator the smart meter customers
can obtain insight into their energy consumption with the smart meter which can be the first
step towards saving energy energy suppliers contribute to this by offering their customers 
which is expected to take place as from 2017  an energy contract with flexible energy tariffs
for which a smart meter is required moreover the smart meter is necessary to maintain the
balance between the supply and demand of electricity now that more and more energy is
being generated by wind and by the sun the smart meter is an important part of smart grids
for grid operators

the largescale offer of smart meters started in the beginning of 2015 this was a largescale
logistic operation at the peak in 2016 enexis installed eight smart meters every minute by the
end of 2016 the smart meter had already been installed at over one million households and it
is our objective to install the smart meter at another 459000 addresses in 2017

however speed is not the most important element it is our aim that customers are satisfied
with the installation process in over 90 of the number of offerings the meter was installed
successfully directly in other cases for example the customer was not at home it was
technically not possible to install the meter or the customer refused the meter customer
also have the right to decide to not have the smart meter installed in 2016 36 of the
customers who were offered a smart meter decided not to have one installed 2015 50
the sector average was 54

  at the high tech systems park it is all about technology and innovation companies want to
   work here to be able to innovate faster together a traditional energy grid is not really fitting
   for this therefore at the time of the development of the business park it had already been
   determined that a sustainable energy grid would have to be installed we examined the
   possibilities together with owner thales advisory agency dwa and enpuls a smart grid has
   now been installed and companies share their industrial residual heating and cooling if there
   is a surplus of heating or cooling in one building this is exchanged in a smart manner with
   another building where this is needed this is unique and really innovative on this scale enexis
   has demonstrated in this project that it can think ahead that surprised me but it is also what
   i expect from a grid operator show that you aim for the best solution for our business park
   and that you can set aside traditional methods and technology our smart grid is not simply
   a onesizefitsall solution the collaboration went very well because we also have the same
   mentality just do it inspire each other and arrive at the best solution the high tech systems
   park is a blueprint for industrial residual heating systems which others can also benefit from

innovation
innovation is essential for us now that the energy world is
developing so rapidly we want to make use of new technology
in our grids and to support our customers with their future
energy needs we look ahead we make prototypes and test
innovations in practice enexis opts for scalable solutions that
accelerate the energy transition

we innovate as much as possible together with customers market parties cooperatives
municipalities and provinces as solutions not only have to be technically correct they also have
to be geared to the needs of our stakeholders moreover we can make use of each others
expertise to accelerate the process in order to emphasise this ambition we have included a
concrete target for stakeholder engagement for 2017

the first steps have been set for this in 2016 we organised alliance factories in which we
entered into a dialogue about the contribution that we can deliver to for instance solar energy
an example of such an alliance factory is ruimte voor zon space for sun in groningen in
which enexis works together with the province groningen around 90 partners have joined this
project to realise additional solar parks in groningen another example is the enexis huis limburg
that we developed together with the province limburg and the municipality of maastricht this
education and information centre for living sustainably will open its doors in the second quarter
of 2017

innovation in our grids
a large share of our innovations is related to digitalisation a digital measuring technology that
we are installing is smart cable guard with this enexis can measure minuscule interruptions in a
cable and predict whether a short circuit will occur within a number of weeks the system gives
a warning timely so that the cable connection can be repaired before the electricity outage
actually occurs

we aim to accommodate the expected changes in the energy supply and demand with smart
innovations without having to increase the capacity of the energy grids an interesting example
is the pilot jouw energie moment 20 which began at the end of 2016 in residential districts in
breda in this pilot fudura works together with senfal shifft technolution and tno we test
how energy can be used and divided and how the expenses allocated over the various
households research is being conducted into a business model for flexibility services such as
smart devices and an electric car that is profitable for all parties involved storing energy with
the aid of a home battery is part of the pilot with this home battery customers can store the
energy that they have generated or offer it to others in the area

open data
the availability of data is an important preconditions for innovation within the statutory
limitations we make our data available for general use as much as possible we offer for
instance lowvolume consumers data on an aggregate level asset data and geographical
information with this we support municipalities and market parties with the development of
applications we introduced a new key figures app on the enexis website in 2016 this app
provides all important information about the gas and electricity grid per province
municipality and towncity for example the number of charging points smart meters and
buildings with solar panels

                                                        work of many colleagues is changing we consider it important that enexis involves all its
                                                        employees in the journey that we are going to make at an early stage the organisation calls
                                                        on its employees capacity for change however changing is easier for some people than for
                                                        others as works council we emphasise that we understand that there are colleagues who find

        changing is easier                              change difficult by explaining the benefits and the need of strategic plans at an early stage
                                                        and by making the consequences for their jobs clear so that they can anticipate on this if we

        for some people                                 expect employees to take action then they must be given insight into the companys plans
                                                        for the future and they must be able to see good opportunities and a positive future for

        than for others                                 themselves we discussed this regularly in 2016 with the management also in connection with
                                                        the reassignment of our new endinet colleagues they deserve a clear perspective the works
                                                        council has promoted the interest of endinet colleges to be supported from job to job and
                                                        this has worked out well generally we are happy with this certainly in times of change it is
                                                        a privilege that we can make our voices heard new works council elections will be held in 2017
                                                        and we expect that more employees  hopefully also young talent and managers  will want

change capacity of
the organisation
the energy transition makes demands on enexiss change
capacity we aim to accommodate the changing wishes of our
customers understand new technologies and be able to apply
them effectively and at the same time we must continue to
ensure that customers have energy 247

we expect from our employees that they take initiatives to improve processes and that they
contribute towards building the new energy system we want to make use of the talent in the
organisation to accelerate the sustainable supply of energy therefore it is our aim to ensure
that our employees find their work energising that they do their work with enthusiasm and
enjoyment and that they carry out their duties to the best of their abilities

in order to measure employee engagement we conduct a random survey every quarter among
our employees we achieved an average score of 79 in the last quarter of 2016 this score is
considerably above the national average but below the target that we set ourselves in 2016

dilemma increasing agility
agility is a much discussed theme in 2016 and places us for a dilemma we want to prepare the
organisation for a role in the future energy supply without knowing exactly what this will look
like increasing agility is in line with the dynamic of present times in which developments go
very fast further digitalisation means for enexis that administrative processes can be
simplified in addition to cost savings this has the consequence that this will cause jobs to
disappear in the future in particular in the administrative and supporting positions

sustainable employability
in a number of years enexis will be working with substantially fewer people as work will be
disappearing this is a trend that is visible throughout society tasks are disappearing because
these are being automated on the other hand new work is being added due to the
innovative role of the grid operator for example due to new activities of enpuls and the
increasing attention for energy savings although this shift is partially being absorbed by
natural staff turnover it is important to continue to work on sustainable employability of
employees within and outside enexis

in order to work on their own employability enexis employees are entitled to a personal
sustainable employability budget of eur 500 a calendar year they can use this budget to pay
for activities and resources to improve their knowledge and skills or to remain healthy fit and
motivated to perform their work well compared to 2015 more employees have used their
budget in 2016 around eur 300 was spent on average per employee recurring expenditure
objectives were related to sports training and education

the sustainable employability plus arrangement is applicable in the event of reorganisations
the point of departure in this scheme is that prior to a reorganisation a process is started in
which we look for a new job together with the employees assistance is provided to
employees to go from job to job

report on 2016  accessible energy supply




  our association will not rest until 100 of the households in the netherlands have access to
   sustainable energy a considerable ambition that we can only realise with a stable and reliable
   energy supply as the point of departure as people only dare to opt for solar panels heating
   pumps or an electric car if they are sure that the infrastructure is reliable enexis has to provide
   this absolute confidence to consumers companies and local energy cooperatives and there is
   something else too enexis can also be the driver of alternative energy solutions the company
   has the knowledge data and insights to bring municipalities and market parties together to
   determine a sustainable roadmap together in which districts does the energy grid need to be
   replaced soon and which solutions of our members could be potentially interesting for this
   at present legislation can sometimes form an obstacle for grid operators to offer the smartest
   solution but hopefully this will change soon as the energy transition is more than technology
   we have to join forces to inspire people in the netherlands and make them enthusiastic
   for sustainable energy

   olof van der gaag
   director of the dutch associaton for sustainable energy
   nederlandse vereniging duurzame energie




  as a grid operator we also have a social role and we are very aware of this energy has to be
   available for everyone and must remain affordable it is part of our culture to make responsible       the energy transition
   choices and we also aim to help customers make responsible choices in 2016 we made it
   possible in our systems to pay for energy per 15 minutes via the smart meter energy suppliers         demands more than
   can now offer a 15minute tariff to their customers and software developers can start
   developing smart energy consumption managers in this manner we facilitate the market
   and we help customers to use energy when it is the cheapest

accessible energy supply
our energy grid is accessible for everyone under the same
conditions enexis aims for an affordable and accessible energy
supply and promotes the operation of market forces

enexis aims to charge as low as possible tariffs for grid management in this manner we ensure
that the energy supply remains accessible for everyone the netherlands authority for
consumers  markets acm sets the maximum tariffs for the transmission of gas and
electricity every three years enexis aims to charge the lowest possible tariffs we lowered our
tariffs in 2016 by on average 07 in line with the acms tariff decisions

the netherlands authority for consumers  markets acm published the method decisions
in september 2016 for national and regional energy grid operators for the period 20172021
these method decisions specify how acm determines the maximum tariffs

market facilitation
in the dutch market model facilitating the market is a task of the grid operators customers
and governments expect that grid operators in addition to providing for the reliable
transmission of energy at the lowest possible costs also contribute to the free operation of
market forces for example we ensure that customers can freely switch from one energy
supplier to another and we organise the exchange of the necessary data we do this together
with the other grid operators in central systems we have drawn up a roadmap together with
sector associations for market facilitation in the near future an important aspect in this is
making the division of roles clear between existing and new market parties such as energy
cooperatives and independent service providers

                                         in a sound future for the company on the other hand we look at the interests of our citizens

                                         concerned we have to make wellbalanced choices in this regard as shareholders committee
                                         we are satisfied with the result in 2016 in all aspects the financial result is in accordance with
                                         what we had agreed and we consider this predictability to be important we are also pleased

        form an opinion                  a process that has been accelerated by the dynamics in the energy sector enexis literally
                                         mobilised us to form opinions and to enter into a dialogue about future scenarios
                                         as shareholders committee we consider it crucial to initiate new projects that help to
                                         accelerate the energy transition we would therefore also like to see that the state as agreed
                                         in the energy agreement gives sufficient room to the company and the shareholders to

report on 2016  economic performance




economic performance
enexiss financial situation was influenced positively in 2016
by the acquisition of endinet and the transfer of the grid
areas friesland and noordoostpolder however we were also
faced with a number of nonrecurring cost items nevertheless
we lived up to our profit expectations

profit for the year
we realised a profit for the year of eur 207 million in 2016 this is eur16 million lower than in
2015 this decrease was due to higher expenses the increase in expenses due to the
acquisition of endinet and the exchange of the servicing areas in friesland and the
noordoostpolder was compensated by an increase in turnover as a consequence of this
exchange the decrease in the net profit was therefore mainly due to nonrecurring cost items

municipalities in the netherlands are increasingly charging municipal land use taxes for utility
grids to the grid operators up to the present this has almost not been the case in our
servicing area we appreciate this choice of municipalities who thus act in the interests of our
customers and their citizens

revenue and other operating income
our revenue in 2016 amounted to eur 1376 million an increase of 17 compared with 2015
eur 1353 million on balance the increase was the result of
ċċ eur 22 million higher revenue from metering services which was mainly due to an average
   tariff increase of 146 furthermore revenue rose because the number of connections
   increased on balance due to the acquisition of endinet and the transfer of the grid areas in
   friesland and the noordoostpolder to alliander
ċċ eur 8 million higher revenue from gas transmission and connection fees revenue was about
   eur 22 million higher due to the service area exchange a decrease of both the transmission
   tariffs 47 and the connection tariffs 54 led to a eur 14 million lower revenue
ċċ eur 7 million lower revenue from electricity transmission and connection fees the tariffs for
   transmission fees rose by on average 03 on the other hand connection fees decreased by
   121 revenues were also lower due to fewer nonrecurring corrections with regard to
   previous years the abovementioned exchange led to an increase in the revenue concerned

other operating income was eur 12 million higher in 2016 than in 2015 this increase was
mainly the consequence of the sale of aktivabedrijf friesland bv with which a transaction
result of eur 13 million was realised the available balance for operating activities is thus
eur 38 million higher than in 2015 this amounts to eur 1179 million over 2016 2015
eur 1141 million

report on 2016  economic performance



operating expenses
the total operating expenses rose in 2016 by eur 89 million to eur 836 million
2015 eur 747 million this increase in expenses is mainly due to higher depreciation
expenses and impairments higher personnel expenses and higher expenses for
outsourced work materials and other external expenses a general summary of the figures
ċċ eur 43 million higher depreciation expenses and impairments eur 32 million of the
   increase is due to the acquisition of endinet and eur 11 million is due to the disinvestment
   of the first generation of smart gas and electricity meters
ċċ eur 29 million higher personnel expenses this is also due to the higher retirement age as
   a result of which eur 12 million extra was allocated to personnel provisions furthermore
   the headcount has risen on balance due to the acquisition of endinet and the exchange
   of the grid areas in friesland and the noordoostpolder in combination with a collective
   labour agreement increase of 15 percent this leads to an increase in expenses of around
   eur 9 million
ċċ eur 17 million higher expenses for outcoursed work materials and other external expenses
   and other operating expenses in addition to the effects of the exchange of grid areas and
   more maintenance work eur 13 million the increase of eur 7 million is due to the creation
   of a provision for disputes on the other hand there was a eur 2 million lower allocation to
   the provision for doubtful debts

financial income and expenses
the balance of the financial income and expenses over 2016 amounted to eur 73 million
this is eur 20 million lower than in 2015 the intention to repay the perpetual loan in 2016
led to eur 21 million higher expenses in 2015 than in 2016 the early repayment of one of the
shareholders loans resulted in an advantage of eur 4 million in 2016 the third bond loan of
eur 500 million which was issued in the course of 2015 and a loan of also eur 500 million
issued in 2016 led to eur 8 million higher interest expenses in 2016 than in 2015

credit rating
the longterm credit ratings of enexis holding nv and enexis bv were reconfirmed in 2016 by
both rating agencies moodys credit rating remained unchanged at aa3 with a stable outlook
the credit rating issued by standard  poors sp was maintained at a with a stable
outlook the aforementioned credit ratings amply meet enexiss requirements for maintaining
its longterm a rating profile

a shortterm credit rating was requested and issued at the end of 2016 for enexis holding nv
this because a euro commercial paper ecp programme was set up in december 2016 with
the objective of being able to attract shortterm funding as from 2017 the shortterm credit
rating of enexis holding nv is p1 moodys and a1 standard and poors

incorporation of enpuls bv
in order to contribute to the acceleration of the energy transition we introduced the new
company enpuls in 2016 enpuls develops scalable solutions for energy greening and energy
savings together with internal and external partners in doing so enpuls focuses on four
themes sustainable regional development flexibility energy savings and sustainable mobility
with this we are contributing to achieving the energy objectives laid down in the
energy agreement

  children are very good at asking the why question they look at problems differently and
   therefore they may well be the most pure stakeholders and fair advisers that a company could
   wish for we are happy that enexis is one of the 75 organisations that is smart enough to take
   the opinions of children seriously and to make use of these two primary school classes of
   de ijsselhof in zwolle formed enexiss childrens council in the past year and provided advice
   on the dilemma how can enexis ensure that people make as sustainable use as possible of
   energy the childrens council carried out an indepth investigation formulated its advice and
   discussed this with the executive board in january it was a privilege for me again to facilitate
   this meeting their message was clear we only have one planet and we have to treat it
   with care and respect and therefore just as we all our enexis is also responsible for this
   children are a genuine stakeholder of every organisation also of enexis that enexis takes
   this so seriously is an indication for me of the openness of enexis in the defining of their
   new role in the energy transition

  we want our contribution to society to be positive nevertheless our work also impacts the
   environment due to for example co2 emissions and waste we are working hard on reducing
   this impact for example by means of efficient energy transport to avoid grid losses as much
   as possible and thus to prevent co2 we also recycle energy meters cables and pipelines
   in addition we aim to increase the sustainability of our mobility with around 4500 employees
   we have a lot of travel kilometres that produce a considerable amount of co2 emissions
                                                                                                       we only have one
   we worked on drawing up a more sustainable lease policy in 2016 which was implemented
   in 2017 we stimulate electric green gas and hybrid cars and public transport with the ambition

   to reduce our emissions in 2020 by 50 all measures that we take demand an open mind
   i am proud that the childrens council has helped us find solutions to complex issues

report on 2016  impact own operations




impact own operations
we are aware of the impact of our own operations on the
environment increasing sustainability therefore starts with
ourselves we want to give the good example as a company and
as employees by reducing our energy consumption and making
it more sustainable and we want to actively promote this

in addition to our task to increase the sustainability of the energy supply we wish to also
conserve energy and the environment we took measures in 2016 to reduce our energy
consumption to recycle more and to enter into agreements with suppliers about this

reduction of our co2 footprint
as from the reporting year 2016 we have started dividing our co2 footprint into three
categories to make clear for which greenhouse gas emissions we are responsible for ourselves
this division into three scopes according to the international greenhouse gas protocol also
makes it easier to benchmark our emissions with other companies in the sector and to initiate
reduction measures

our co2 emissions in 2016 amounted to 152467 tons and were thus higher than in 2015
this increase was mainly caused by an increase in the leakage losses from the gas grid the grid
components by suppliers which are included in our footprint as from 2016 have also risen
more materials have been used by suppliers in 2016 for the replacement and expansion of
pipelines cables transformers stations and installations

the emissions were influenced positively in 2016 by less use of our company vehicles and less
commuter traffic employees are encouraged to opt for public transport more often this was
effective and resulted in 10 more train trips in 2016 increasing the sustainability of our office
buildings also had a positive effect on our co2 emissions less gas was used in 2016 for the
heating of our office buildings

you can find the measures that we took in 2016 to reduce our co2 emissions in the
explanatory notes to the co2 footprint we aim to further increase the transparency about
emissions in the coming years and we will continue to report about this

sustainable mobility
one of the most important co2 reduction measures is enexiss sustainable mobility policy the
objective of this policy is reducing and greening of the mobility of employees the co2
emissions of the vehicle fleet decreased by 18 in 2016 compared with 2014 the realisation is
considerably below our target of 40 the reduction of emissions for claimed kilometres
34 is larger than for lease kilometres 07

co2 reduction of the vehicle fleets is also an objective of enexis in 2017 we motivate
employees to opt more often for public transport cycling electric cars working from home
or holding virtual meetings

                                                                                                          2016            2015            2014               2013           2012

sustainable waste management
we aim to recycle our equipment and raw materials as much as possible we were able to
recycle 88 of our waste this year and energy was recaptured with 6 of the waste in total
94 of the waste was thus given a useful purpose nevertheless our average recycling
percentage was lower than in 2015 this was mainly due to the amount of asbestos that was
released during work that was carried out of the waste produced by endinet 73 was
recycled and 10 was used to recapture energy the total amount of waste decreased in the
past year compared with 2015

                                                                                                          2016            2015            2014               2013           2012

socially responsible procurement
in the selection of suppliers we also weigh their contribution to sustainability and innovation
we also enter into agreements with suppliers about their energy consumption and about
reducing co2 emissions the first steps were also taken in the area of circularity we followed
an intensive process in 2016 to optimise our cable package and to thus reduce grid losses
and co2 emissions this resulted in a tender in 2016 for all medium and low voltage cables
three suppliers were contracted as a result of the optimisation of medium voltage cables
around 21 tons of extra co emissions are being avoided 31 in comparison to our former
cable package

report on 2016  impact own operations



the contracts offer sufficient room to carry out further research into sustainable cables
the use of recycled materials the recyclability at the end of the useful life and the reduction
of co2 emissions during the production and use phase are also examined in the meantime
the first kilometres of cable with a higher percentage for recycles raw materials have
been installed

suppliers code of conduct
with the suppliers code of conduct the suppliers declare that they are aware of their
responsibility and that they will comply with applicable standards in the area of people planet
and profit the code is always included in tenders and additional criteria are added depending
on the type of product or service which are taken into account in the selection of suppliers
responsibilities that are laid down in this code of conduct are discussed in contacts with
strategic suppliers we also check whether suppliers meet these requirements this approach
has led to the termination of the collaboration with one supplier in the past fortunately this
was not the case in 2016

realignment of the procurement policy
we started realigning our socially responsible procurement policy with enexiss strategy in
2016 the policy is based on the principles people plant and products and is based on optimal
collaboration and development with our suppliers the socially responsible procurement
policy is expected to be confirmed in the beginning of 2017 that we are giving socially

governance   report of the supervisory board




       the company gives
       top priority to
       safety and we
       endorse that


                                                                 piet moerland chairman of the supervisory board




how do you look back on 2016
with satisfaction to start with we are satisfied about safety safety is essential in a company
where you work with electricity cables and gas pipelines for our employees and for the
environment the company gives top priority to safety both for its own personnel and the
personnel of contractors and we endorse this as the supervisory board safety is always the
first item on our agenda as far as ambition goes the yardstick was again higher in 2016 than
in 2015 it is good to observe that the reporting culture continues to improve we see that
discipline is increasing and that employees call each other to account on their behaviour
as a result enexis is able to obtain a clearer picture of the safety situation however safety
is never finalised as a theme danger is a constant threat

how do you assess further whether it was
a good year
reliability and affordability are important criteria for a utility company and in this aspect it
was a favourable year enexiss energy supply has a high degree of reliability in comparison with
other countries and also within the netherlands moreover the tariffs for customers are
moderate hundreds of millions of euros are invested every year to keep the energy grids in
good condition this enables us to keep the costs down on the long term and in spite of all
these investments the financial result remains good this is important for the soundness of
the company and for the shareholders dividend

which impact do you think the energy transition
has on the company
the company reformulated its strategy in 2016 this is necessary because we see both
a shorter time frame and higher ambitions for a sustainable energy supply and people are
increasingly generating their own energy the challenge for enexis is on the one hand to
continue with the traditional transmission of energy and to do this more effectively and
efficiently on the other hand the company has to anticipate the energy transition



                                                                                          enexis  annual report 2016          51

governance   report of the supervisory board



enexis has a twofold assignment we discussed the challenges and the strategic direction
extensively and we fully endorse the strategic plan the plan will be submitted to the
shareholders in 2017 for approval

can you elaborate on a number of issues that
you reviewed as the supervisory board
we discussed for example the speed of the energy transition it is uncertain how fast
customer needs are changing enexis has to estimate this and that is difficult we also
discussed what consequences these changes could have for employees in this sector
employee are used to job security while we require more flexibility in the future this is
a rather new development in the grid management sector the executive board is also
discussing this matter with the works council and the shareholders

the composition of the supervisory board changed
in 2016 can you tell something about the division
of roles in the board
we took leave of mr bosscher and mr de jong in the meeting of 18 april 2016 as their terms
had expired i would like to thank both gentlemen again for their commitment and
involvement two new supervisory board members were installed in that same meeting
ms velthuis has expertise in the financial field and as such she has become the chair of the
audit committee mr van dijk has expertise in the field of energy technology with their
expertise and qualifications they form a good addition to the necessary competences in the
supervisory board together we can cover the field of supervision of advice in 2017 as well




                                                                                          enexis  annual report 2016          52

company we also act as the employer of the executive board

composition and organisation
the composition of our board changed during 2016 mr bosscher and mr de jong stepped
down at the annual general meeting of shareholders at the same time ms velthuis and
mr van dijk were appointed as supervisory board members and mr calon was reappointed for

shareholders committee the division of tasks was revised in the sense that mr calon has
been appointed vicechairman mr frans voorwinde acted as secretary to our board in 2016

ms velthuis chair ms caubo and mr calon the remuneration and selection committee is
comprised of mr moerland chairman and mr van dijk ms velthuis and mr van dijk followed
an extensive introduction programme after their appointment

independence
during the whole year all of the members of the supervisory board were independent of
enexis as specified in the dutch corporate governance code the supervisory board is of the
opinion that its composition is such that the members can operate independently in relation
to each other and in relation to the executive board

evaluation functioning of the supervisory board
we evaluated our functioning in january 2016 and in doing so we placed the emphasis on how
the board in its new composition can benefit from our findings the internal assessment
confirmed that the formal matters structure size division of tasks meetings agenda and
such are in order in view of the changes in the energy world and in the distribution of energy
the profile of the supervisory board will be reviewed again in any case before the next new
board appointment is set to take place 2019 we will also reserve time in our annual agenda
to help the new supervisory board members quickly familiarise themselves with the
companyspecific issues of enexis furthermore we are also looking for the right balance
between formal meetings on the one hand and conducting a more informal dialogue with
the organisation on the other hand we appreciate the direct valuable contact that we had
with the management team in 2016 and we strive to continue this in 2017

our duties
as the supervisory board our most important duty is the supervision of the policy of the
executive board and the supervision of the general course of affairs of the company and its
subsidiaries we exercise this supervision mainly through meetings with the executive board

contains a series of permanent agenda items safety is always discussed as the first item on
the agenda just as the executive board we consider safety to be the most important theme

hired by enexis where this is useful and necessary we also discuss individual incidents and
even more important the measures that were taken or will be taken

the daily course of business is discussed during our meetings based on a score card as part of
an extensive monthly management report enexiss performance as grid operator reliability of
supply are continuously reported here we are pleased to observe that the integration of grid
operator endinet was carried out in a careful and efficient manner in 2016 important projects

cumulatively and projections are also included for the financial results and cash flows the
productivity is monitored based on investment summaries and the personnel development

various activities and projects to minimise these risks regulation is an important factor in
enexiss business operations in 2016 we discussed the consequences of the new regulation
period commencing in 2017 extensively the same applies with regard to the separation of
regulated and nonregulated activities which has to be implemented even stricter based on

discussed the control plan of the internal auditor and provided a positive recommendation
for the adoption by the supervisory board

                                                                                        enexis  annual report 2016          54

governance   strategic risks




strategic risks
internal and external events can pose a risk for our continuity
or strategic objectives we monitor the development of risks
closely we determine the probability that risks may occur and
take measures to mitigate the impact of risks
as we are transparent about our risks we are able to take corrective measures faster to
achieve our objectives moreover as a result we remain sharply focused on the requirements
that we have to meet to comply with laws and regulations development with regard to
important strategic risks are reported frequently to the executive board concrete mitigating
measures are specified in the division plans for 2017 and are monitored by the division
management

risk management
enterprise risk management erm enables us to achieve our objectives in a responsible
manner and to render account on this our erm policy is based on the coso enterprise risk
management model and covers all aspects of the company from strategic and operational
risks to the reliability of financial reporting and complying with laws and regulations

in our strategic risk analysis we identify events that threaten the continuity of enexis or which
lead to strategic objectives not being realised timely andor completely we quantify the
identified risks twice a year by plotting these risks in the risk matrix below we then
determine the likelihood and the impact of one or several business values the risk matrix also
specifies enexiss risk appetite the risks with a high score red areas exceed the risk appetite
and must be mitigated by means of additional measures the development of the risks and
the effectiveness of the measures are monitored by means of the planning and control cycle
in this cycle it is also monitored whether these risks actually decrease to an acceptable level

you can find an overview of the instruments procedures and control systems that we used to
control risks on wwwenexisgroepcom in addition to erm we make use of internal audits and
external audits as a safety net

line managers on all levels within the organisation are responsible themselves for identifying
risks and taking riskcontrol measures timely this decentralised responsibility is an essential
element in the manner in which enexis approaches its risks risk are monitored centrally in the
management consultation the outcomes of the strategic risk analysis and the status of the
lor issues are also reported to and discussed in the audit committee this process enables
the eb to issue its in control statement

governance   strategic risks



explanation per risk
1	insufficient organisational capacity for change for the realisation of the energy
    and digital transition
    our capacity for change is the most important risk developments in society and
    technological developments make high demands on our operations and on our employees
    the risk exists that employees no longer have sufficient knowledge and motivation and
    enexis is unable to attract sufficient new qualified personnel this development but also
    continuing to work up to an advanced age can result in higher absenteeism and a higher
    risk of permanent occupational disability in order to mitigate this risk we promote
    sustainable employability and we have increased the leadership level within the
    organisation developed a new job matrix and simplified the remuneration policy and
    company regulations rear more about our measures regarding the change capacity of
    the organisation

2	unauthorised access to systems and data
    privacy and security violations form an increasing risk for society and for our organisation
    having or obtaining unauthorised access to our systems and data can lead to interruptions
    in processes this is why we are improving our authorisation management and we are
    carrying out periodic manual penetration tests and automated security scanning we are
    professionalising initiatives in the field of security policy awareness and the virtual
    security organisation read more about our measures regarding change capacity of
    the organisation

3	energy grid not adapted timely for the energy transition
    we do not have an exact idea about what the energy system will look like in the future
    this also means that we cannot make a blueprint for our organisation and our work
    processes there is a risk that our grids will not have been adapted timely we have
    developed a decisionmaking framework for determining and substantiating grid
    investments developing tooling for realtime insight into and steering of the energy flows
    and monitoring the progress of the energy transition in a national and international
    context rear more about our measures regarding the reliability of the energy supply

4	safety of employees
    due to the primary nature of our processes at the grid operator the likelihood of an
    accident with consequences for the health of employees is present safety is of vital
    importance this is why training and instruction is a continuous process at enexis
    we stimulate employees and contractors to report incidents and we provide for followup
    in order to learn from this and to optimise processes read more about our measures
    regarding the reliability of the energy supply

5	insufficient agility is speed and costs of the ict landscape
    the complexity of ict is increasing and has an effect on our change capacity and our
    agility we are working on rationalisation and we are freezing applications are being
    replaced in the period 20172020




                                                                                          enexis  annual report 2016          64

governance   strategic risks



6	energy legislation impedes facilitating the energy transition
    the tasks of grid operators may possibly be limited by new energy laws this can form an
    impediment for the realisation of our strategic objective to facilitate the energy transition
    enexis encourages a possible broadening by general administrative orders and ensures a
    timely and correct implementation read more about our measures regarding compliance
    with laws and regulations

7	noncompliant with various laws and regulations
    laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex moreover there is more
    supervision on the energy sector and farreaching legality we will make a cyclical
    inventory of the regulations and policy so that measures can be taken timely in connection
    with compliance internally we will make it clear who is the point of contact for legal
    topics read more about our measures regarding compliance with laws and regulations

8	credit risk
    due to changes in the energy market we estimate that the risk that energy suppliers are
    unable to pay the grid fee and meter rent to be higher this risk is discussed on a sector
    level with the netherlands authority for consumers  markets and the ministry of
    economic affairs

9	public safety
    serious safety risks can occur due to failing assets such as fatal accidents or accidents
    resulting in serious physical injury as safety is one our points of departure we analyse the
    risk of unsafe situations in our electricity and gas grids and public lighting read more
    about our measures regarding public safety

10	transmission costs
     the transmission costs charged before 1 january 2004 for transmission in the event of equal
     voltage levels from the enexisgrid to a private grid were a matter of debate in 2015 and
     2016 various legal proceedings have been conducted about this the trade and industry
     appeals tribunal cbb delivered a judgement on 1 december 2016 that the netherlands
     authority for consumers  markets acm had rightfully determined that enexis was
     allowed to charge connection and transmissions tariffs for the private grid in the period 1
     january 2000 up to and including 1 january 2008 as a result the risk of receiving claims
     based on wrongfully charging transmission costs no longer exists




                                                                                           enexis  annual report 2016          65

governance   in control statement




in control statement
the executive board eb is responsible for the design and operation of the internal risk
management and control system the objective of this system is to monitor the realisation
of strategic and operational objectives and the reliability of the financial reporting and
compliance with laws and regulations

the eb has evaluated the set up and effectiveness of the internal risk and control system
during 2016 also based on the business control information letters of representation
reports from the internal auditor and the management letter from the external auditor
the executive board is of the opinion that enexiss internal risk management and control
system with regard to the control objectives in the field of financial reporting has functioned
properly in 2016 and that it provides a reasonable degree of certainty that the financial
reporting is free from material misstatement

our internal risk management and control system is described in the section corporate
governance no system whatsoever can provide absolute certainty that we will be able to
realise our company objectives or that no material misstatements losses fraud or violations
of laws and regulations occur in processes and financial reporting based on the above we are
of the opinion that we have thus complied with the best practice provisions ii13 ll14 and ll15
of the corporate governance code

the aforementioned was also discussed with the audit committee of the supervisory board

23 accounting principles for consolidation
the consolidated financial statements contain the financial statements of enexis holding nv
and its group companies

group companies concern all entities over which the group exercises control ie the group is
exposed to or is entitled to variable results based on its involvement with the entity and has
the possibility to influence these results as a based on its power to steer the activities of the
entity group companies are included in the consolidation from the date on which decisive
control is obtained group companies are no longer included in the consolidation as from the
date on which the criteria for group companies are no longer fulfilled

consolidation takes place using the integral consolidation method in the event that the
interest of enexis holding nv in the group company amounts to less than 100 the minority
interest is disclosed in equity and in the income statement financial relationships and results
between consolidated companies are eliminated

in the event of loss of control the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary any minority
interests and other equity components in connection with the subsidiary are no longer
included in the balance sheet any surplus or shortfall resulting from the loss of control is
recognised in the income statement if the group retains an interest in the former subsidiary
that interest is recognised at fair value as from the date that control ceased to exist
after initial recognition the interest is recognised as an investment in accordance with the
equity method or as a financial asset available for sale depending on the degree of control
that is maintained

24 valuation principles and accounting policies relating to the
determination of the result
estimates and assumptions
certain estimates and assumptions are made in the preparation of the financial statements
that can also determine the recognised amounts differences between actual outcomes
and the estimates and assumptions have an effect on the amounts that are reported in
future periods

assumptions and estimates made by the management mainly have an effect on the valuation
of tangible and intangible fixed assets note 12 and 13 the necessity to recognise impairments
of tangible and intangible fixed assets note 12 and 13 see also impairments in the accounting
principles the necessity to recognise possible impairments of debtors note 17 the valuation
of provisions note 24 and the reporting of the net revenues note 1

currency
nonmonetary assets valued in a foreign currency according to the acquisition price are
converted at the exchange rate applicable on the transaction date nonmonetary assets
valued in a foreign currency according to the present value are converted at the exchange rate
applicable on the date on which the present value was determined

offsetting
offsetting of asset and liability items takes place per counter party if it is the case that
there is a contractual right to offset the recognised amounts and it is the case that there
is the intention to offset in the event that there is no right to offset amounts or
there is no intention to settle asset and liability items at the same time then these are
recognised separately

there where based on a contract the right exists to offset the asset and liability items this is
disclosed in the relevant note further information is then also provided on the balances of
the asset and liability item

presentation
the classification used for the presentation of the income statement is by category
the transmission system services and distribution losses costs are presented directly after the
net revenue and other operating income due to the relationship with the net revenue as well
as the distinction in relation to other operating costs that our organisation can influence more
in the short term

valuation at fair value
the group values a number of financial instruments such as derivatives as at the balance
sheet date at fair value in addition an explanation of the fair values of interestbearing
liabilities is provided in note 32 financing policy and risks associated with financial
instruments the fair value is the price that would be received when selling an asset on the
valuation date or that would be paid to transfer a liability if transactions took place regularly
between market participants on the valuation date in the valuation at fair value it is assumed
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place
ċċ on the most important market for the asset or the liability or if that does not exist
ċċ on the most favourable market for the asset or the liability

the group must have access to the most important or the most favourable market the fair
value of an asset or a liability is determined using assumptions which market participants
would take as the point of departure for the valuation of the asset or the liability under the
assumption that market participants act in their economic interest in the valuation of a non
financial asset at fair value the ability of a market participant to generate economic benefits
by making maximum and optimal use of the asset or by selling it to another market
participant who would make maximum and optimal use of the asset is taken into account

the group applies valuation methods that are appropriate given the circumstances and for
which sufficient information is available to determine the fair value and whereby as many
relevant observable inputs as possible are used and as little as possible nonobservable inputs




                                                                                           enexis  annual report 2016          77

                                                                                                                     b77      f79

are used all assets and liabilities for which the fair value is determined or stated in the
financial statements are classified in the fair value hierarchy described below based on the
input of the lowest level that is significant for the whole valuation
ċċ level 1 the fair value equals the listed prices in an active market
ċċ level 2 the fair value is based on parameters that are directly or indirectly observable in
   the market
ċċ level 3 the fair value is based on parameters that are not observable in the market

for assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the financial statements on a
recurring basis the group determines at the end of each reporting period whether due to a
reassessment a change has occurred in the level classification of the hierarchy based on the
input of the lowest level that is significant for the whole valuation

in connection with stating the fair values the group has determined categories of assets and
liabilities based on the nature characteristics and risks of the assets and liabilities and the level
in the fair value hierarchy as explained above

business combinations and goodwill
business combinations are accounted for by using the acquisition method the costs of the
acquisition are valued at the total of the fair value on the acquisition date of the transferred
compensation and the amount of the minority interests in the acquired entity the group
determines for each business combination whether the minority interests in the acquired
entity are valued at fair value or the proportional share of the identifiable net assets of the
acquired entity costs in connection with the acquisition are recognised in the result in the
year in which these costs are incurred

when the group acquires a company it assesses the financial assets and acquired liabilities
for the appropriate classification and allocation based on contractual conditions economic
circumstances and relevant circumstances on the date of acquisition this also comprises
the separation of derivative instruments included in contracts in base contracts of the
acquiring party

every conditional payment that is transferred by the acquiring party will initially be valued at
fair value on the acquisition date a conditional payment that classifies as an asset or a liability
as a financial instrument and that falls within the scope of ias 39 is valued at fair value
whereby changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement

goodwill is the difference between the costs of the acquisition of the company less the
balance of the fair value of identifiable assets and the fair value of the acquired liabilities of
the company the costs of the acquisition of the company are valued at the total of the fair
value on the acquisition date of the transferred compensation and the amount of the
minority interests in the acquired entity goodwill is carried at cost less any impairment losses
goodwill is assessed each year for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be subject to impairment an
impairment of goodwill cannot be reversed




                                                                                              enexis  annual report 2016          78

there where goodwill is allocated to a cashflow generating unit and forms part of the
divested activities within this unit the goodwill that pertains to the divested activities forms
part of the book value of the activities when determining the book result of the divested
activities goodwill which is divested under these circumstances is valued based on the
relative values of the divested activities and the part that remains in the cashflow
generating unit

impairments
during the financial year an assessment is made whether there is any indication that an asset
may be impaired if any such indications exist an estimate is made of the recoverable amount
of the asset the recoverable amount of an asset is the highest of the fair value less the costs
to sell the asset or its net realisable value

an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or of the cashgenerating
unit to which it belongs exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset concerned impairment
losses are charged to the result impairments of goodwill will not be reversed

an impairment is reversed in the event that it is determined that the points of departure
based upon which at the time the recoverable amount was determined have changed and
insofar as the remaining carrying amount of the assets is lower than the carrying amount that
would have been determined after the deduction of depreciation charges had no impairment
of the asset been recognised in previous years the effects of reversing an impairment are
credited to the result

financial instruments
purchases and sales of financial instruments are recognised on the transaction date
the group no longer recognises a financial asset in the balance sheet if the contractual rights
to the cash flows from the asset have expired or if the group transfers the contractual rights
to the receipt of the cash flows from the financial asset by means of a transaction whereby
all of the risks and benefits connected to the ownership of this asset are transferred

the group makes use of the following financial instruments

nonderivative financial instruments
nonderivative financial instruments comprise deposits trade debtors and other receivables
loans provided borrowings and other financing obligations trade payables and other payables

nonderivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value after initial recognition
nonderivative financial instruments are recognised in the manner described below

financial assets and liabilities are recognised separately offsetting only takes place in the
even that
ċċ the group has a legally enforceable right to set off this amount and
ċċ if the group intends to set off on a net basis and to realise the asset and the liability at
   the same time




                                                                                               enexis  annual report 2016          79

annual report   explanatory notes to the consolidated financial statements



financial assets held to maturity
financial assets held to maturity comprise loans provided to associates and external parties
depending on the applicable maturities and conditions deposits can also be classified as
financial assets held to maturity

when the group explicitly has the intention and is able to retain financial assets to maturity
these are then valued at amortised costs plus any directly attributable transaction costs based
on the effective interest method less impairment losses

financial assets classified as available for sale
depending on the applicable maturities and conditions the groups investments in deposits
and money market funds can be classified as financial assets available for sale

financial assets available for sale are valued at fair value both initially and during the period
that the asset is held changes in fair value are recognised in equity total result when these
assets are sold the cumulative value change which is recognised in equity will be recognised
in the income statement interest income is recognised in the income statement in the period
to which this income can be allocated investments in equities or other securities of which
the market value is not listed on an active market and of which the fair value cannot be
determined reliably are valued after initial recognition at cost

other nonderivative financial instruments
other nonderivative financial instruments comprise trade debtors and other receivables

other nonfinancial instruments are valued at amortised cost based on the effective interest
method less impairments that are recognised in the income statement

derivative financial instruments
the group can make use of derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in future cash flows of
periodically to be paid interest or to hedge the risks of foreign currencies these changes in
cash flows can result from developments in market interest rates or market exchange rates of
foreign currencies enexis applies hedge accounting where possible in view of the specific use
of derivatives to mitigate the interest rate and the exchange rate risk of cash flows

valuation of derivatives takes place at fair value the fair value of interest rate derivatives is
determined by means of discounting the future cash flows the fair value of currency
derivatives is determined by means of discounting future cash flows converted at the market
exchange rates the discount rate is determined based on the market interest rate at the end
of the financial year the cash flows are determined based on the contractual agreed interest
rates maturity dates and nominal amounts changes in the fair value are recognised in the
hedge reserve part of the equity capital provided that hedging is effective to a large degree
the ineffective part of the hedge is recognised directly in the income statement under
financial income and expenses

derivatives are classified under current or noncurrent other financial assets in the event that

other financial liabilities
other financial liabilities included borrowings guarantees received trade payables and other
payables and other financing obligations

other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest method

a financial liability is no longer recognised if the obligation ceases to exist ie when the
obligation laid down in the contract has not been fulfilled or the obligation has been
dissolved or has expired in the event that existing financial obligations are replaced by other
obligations that are entered into with the same lender and the conditions differ significantly
or the conditions of the existing obligation have been revised significantly such a replacement
or amendment is treated as the termination of the existing obligation and the entering in of a
new obligation the difference in valuation is charged to or credited to the result

pension obligations
the cover ratio at pension fund abp at the end of 2016 amounted to 966 2015 972 the
financial position of the fund improved considerably by the end of 2016 compared with the
beginning of 2016 the cover ration amounted to 912 at the end of january 2016 the cover
ratio of 966 lies considerably above the critical threshold whereby pensions would have to
be reduced the improvement of the financial situation is mainly due to the development of
the interest rate in the fourth quarter

the contribution for the retirement and surviving dependents pension for 2016 amounted to
178 as from 1 january 2016 and 188 as of 1 april 2016 2015 196 the increase of the
contribution as of 1 april 2016 was in connection with the low cover ratio of the fund at the
end of 2015

the lower contribution in 2016 was mainly due to the switch from wage to price
compensation and to the termination of a nonrecurring component of 09 of the
contribution of 2015

as of 1 january 2017 the contribution for the retirement pension and the surviving
dependents pension has been determined at 211 the fund requires a structurally higher
contribution level in order to ensure that the pension scheme remains affordable a first step
will be set in 2017 with an increase of 23 percentage points further steps are expected in the
coming years

as from 1 january 2016 the contribution division between the employer and the employee is
70 and 30 percent respectively the division was still 68 and 32 percent respectively in 2015

fixed operating assets the loans in connection with these agreements are recognised under
the lease obligations the assets and liabilities concerned are initially recognised at amounts

or if lower at the present value of the minimal lease payments the assets are subsequently
depreciated in accordance with identical assets that the company owns itself the
depreciation period can be shorter if the lease period is shorter will not be extended and the
asset in question will not be purchased the paid lease instalments are divided in such a
manner between the financing expenses and repayment of the outstanding liability that a
constant periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability is shown during each
period of the lease

1 net revenue
net revenue accounts for the income from the supply of goods and services relating to
the distribution of electricity and gas and other activities less turnover tax and energy tax
the invoicing of lowvolume energy consumers takes place based on fixed amounts
depending on the size capacity of the connection

the invoicing of highvolume energy consumers takes place periodically based on the
contractually agreed capacity and in addition for electricity based on the metered
consumption and actual grid load

the tariffs to be used for the determination of the revenue are regulated by the netherlands
authority for consumers and markets the revenue is determined by adding the estimate of
the still to be invoiced grid charges to the invoiced grid charges and deducting the estimate
of the still to be invoiced grid charges at the end of the previous reporting period

at the end of 2016 the estimated grid fee for smallvolume consumers amounted to
eur 69 million and for largevolume consumers eur 29 million together 71 of total revenue
the conclusion differences on these estimates are in general small the estimated revenue
concerns the month of december and is largely based on meter readings

enexis divides the transmitted energy among its customers through its allocation and
reconciliation process in this case the allocation is the advance and the reconciliation is
the final settlement the difference between the energy taken up by the distribution grid and
the energy allocated to end users after allocation and reconciliation is the grid loss
the reconciliation of the calendar year in question is only finalised after a reconciliation
process that takes 20 months based on estimates enexis tries to estimate the final
reconciliation as accurately as possible

the effect from reconciliation resulted in a positive settlement of eur 8 million in 2016

at the end of 2016 the estimated costs of transmission and system services amounted to
eur 8 million and distribution losses amounted to eur 7 million together 66 of total
procurement expenses the conclusion difference on these estimates are limited

3 other operating income
other operating income recognises income that is not directly related to the core activities

operating subsidies are recognised in the result in the period to which they relate subsidies
are only recognised as soon as the receipt of these subsidies can be determined with
reasonable certainty

contributions received in advance for the installation of grids and connections are amortised
parallel to the depreciation of the asset concerned and recognised in other operating income

5 depreciation and decommissioning
property plant and equipment
depreciation takes place in accordance with the straightline method the expected future
useful life of the asset is taken into account in determining the depreciation the useful life
and residual value of assets are assessed each year any adjustments are recognised
prospectively land is not depreciated a tangible fixed asset is no longer recognised in the
balance sheet when it is divested or when no future economic benefits are expected from
the further use of the asset or in the event of disposal of the asset a possible gain or loss

the assets that are classified as software concern mainly the net registration system various
operating systems connection registrations customer information systems job order
management systems and other support systems

the goodwill relates to the acquisitions of intergas energie bv in 2011 and endinet groep bv
in 2016 and concerns the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of
the net assets at the time of the acquisition

an assessment was made during the financial year whether there are any indications for
impairment of electricity gas and other assets whereby the net realisable value is taken as
the point of departure apart from this the annual impairment test is carried out each year
for the cash flow generating units in which goodwill is included the goodwill that arose from
the acquisition of intergas energie bv amounts to eur 15 million and has been attributed to
the cash flow generating unit of the gasrelated activities of the goodwill resulting from the
acquisition of endinet groep bv on 1 january 2016 eur 19 million can be allocated to the
other activities eur 19 million to the electricity activities and eur 59 million to the gas
activities the goodwill that was allocated to the electricity and gas activities based on the
fair value ratios of the assets on 1 january 2016 was hereby allocated to the cash flow
generating units of the electricity and gas activities

such a calculation only takes place for all individual assets if events or changes in
circumstances give rise to this triggering event analysis it is determined based on the
outcomes of this calculation whether an impairment has to be recognised an assessment
is made annually and at the time of interim publication whether such events or changes
have occurred

annual report   notes to the consolidated financial statements



the direct realisable values of the electricity gas and other assets are determined based on
the most recent longterm financial calculation this calculation comprises a period of five
years the most important points of departure that are included in this calculation are among
others estimates of the discounting rate based on the wacc percentages used by the acm
the regulated tariffs and the development of the number of connections and services as well
as the operating and other expenses the chosen points of departure concern estimates and
are mainly based on the most recent information with regard to tariff regulation method
decision 20172021 the investment programme strategic asset management plan and the
smart meter rollout programme

as a consequence of the method decision 20172021 revenue will decrease due to the
xfactors determined in this method decision which is a discount to promote efficient
business operations this is offset by a revenue increase due to an inflation adjustment
and a combination of growth of the number of connections and the expected capacity
demand of customers the revenue growth as a result of these effects is expected to show
a slight cumulative increase of between 0 and 05 over the whole period 20172021
subsequent calculations of the acm are not included in this expectation the operational
cost level is expected to remain constant as enexis pays a lot of attention to efficient business
operations whereby programmes are initiated that aim to prevent an increase of the costs
due to inflation

it is further determined in the regulation that the efficient average costs are covered in
the tariffs to be set by the acm it is estimated that enexiss performance will be average
compared with other grid operators in the field of investments as the grids of all grid
operators in the sector are comparable

a growth rate for the regulated activities of 0 is used to determine the end value as it is
assumed that the whole sector operates equally efficiently at that point in time the final
value is therefore assumed to be equal to the efficient book value regulated asset value of
that point in time a growth rate of 2 applies for the nonregulated activities based on the
free cash flows

the thus calculated direct realisable values of the electricity gas and other assets were
well above the values in use of the corresponding assets with and without the addition
of the goodwill allocated to these assets there is therefore no necessity for an impairment
of goodwill

part of the national energy agenda of the ministry of economic affairs is the vision that the
netherlands must work towards achieving a low co2 energy supply in 2050 a potential risk in
connection with this is that the period in which there is still a need for gas grids becomes
shorter than the currently determined depreciation periods this could lead to the necessity
to shorten the depreciation periods of the existing gas grids or to have to start writing off the
existing gas grids however at present we still see no reason for this as part of these grids will
be used in the future for the transmission of green gas instead of natural gas furthermore
enexis is very cautious about installing new and replacing gas grids when other alternative
heating systems such as heating grids or allelectric solutions could be possible

the valuation of economic interests that are not included in the consolidation but in which
enexis does have a significant influence takes place based on the equity method based on
the accounting principles governing the valuation and the determination of the result of
enexis holding nv according to this method the economic interest is initially valued at
cost whereby the carrying amount is increased or decreased after the initial recognition with
the share of enexis holding nv in the result dividends received are deducted from the
carrying amount

in the event of a negative net asset value losses on associates are recognised up to the
amount of the net investment in the associate this net investment also includes loans that
have been provided to associates insofar as these loans actually form part of the net
investment for the share in additional losses a provision is only recognised in the event and
to the extent that enexis has guaranteed the debts of the associate or in the event that enexis
has the firm intention to enable the associate for the share to repay its debts by virtue of
legal obligations

in the event of a possible impairment of an associate reference is made to the accounting
method as included in the paragraph impairments in the accounting principles for
financial reporting

assets held for sale practically all concern the assets of enexis in friesland and in the
noordoostpolder which were transferred to alliander nv on 1 january 2016 with the
exchange transaction of endinet groep bv

in addition to the above transaction a small amount of this item also pertained to the
proposed sale of the intermediate hs activities by fudura at the end of 2015 it was plausible
to assume that the activities would be sold within one year therefore the assets connected
to the hs activities with a value of eur 04 million were classified as assets held for sale and as
from that moment these assets were no longer depreciated this planned sale ultimately did
not take place and as a result these assets were classified again under property plant and
equipment in 2016 and these assets are being depreciated again

26 deferred corporate income tax
deferred corporate income tax assets and liabilities relate to differences between the carrying
value and the tax basis of tangible fixed assets and employeerelated provisions in addition
deferred taxes pertain to nonrealised results of derivative transactions that have been
formed as a hedge provision via the other comprehensive result and the liability pursuant
to the settlement agreements for the repayment of the perpetual loan corporate income
tax deferrals are valued at nominal value at the corporation tax rate at the end of the
financial year

deferred tax assets are only recognised for offsetable fiscal losses and offsetable temporary
differences between the value of the assets and liabilities in accordance with fiscal rules on
the one hand and the accounting principles followed in these financial statements on the
other hand with the proviso that deferred tax assets are only recognised insofar as it is
probable that there will be future fiscal profits against which the temporary differences can
be offset and losses can be compensated the calculation of the deferred tax assets and
liabilities takes place at the tax rates that apply at the end of the reporting year or at the tax
rates that apply in the coming years insofar as already determined by law deferred tax
liabilities are measured at nominal value

offsetting of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities only takes place if a formal right
to offset exists in connection with the taxation of profits which is levied by the same tax
authority and the company has the intention to settle the deferred taxes at the same time
deferred taxes are recognised at nominal value

the basis for the interest rate risk policy is diversification by means of diversification in
refinancing financing and maturities of loans interest rate fixing and interesttypical maturity
fixed or variable type of loan and possibly geographical diversification over financing
markets availability is ensured and the interest rate risk is reduced

within the adopted policy enexis holding nv has the option to use derivatives to hedge
specific risk positions including but not limited to the interest rate risk enexis holding nv
did not make use of derivatives in 2016 to hedge interest rate risks

receivables
enexis limits the interest rate risk on receivables in two ways
ċċ by matching the maturities of the receivables including the financial assets with the
   liquidity forecast and
ċċ by agreeing contractual interest rates beforehand with regard to the financial assets until
   the expiry date of the concluded contracts only a small amount of the surplus cash and
   cash equivalents is invested with a short horizon or at a variable interest rate to ensure
   diversification and flexibility

borrowed capital

the fair value of the interestbearing loans amounted to approximately eur 2338 million at
yearend 2016 yearend 2015 eur 2434 million this fair value for the bond loans is in
accordance with the listed price and for the other loans in accordance with the calculation
method based on the euro utility a bfv yield curve on 31 december 2016 for the other
loans the values of the interest payments and the repayments of the principals are
discounted at different rates with which the time effect is taken into account the fair value
has mainly decreased due to the settlement of the liability following from the agreements
regarding the repayment of the perpetual loan at the end of 2016

the bond loans concern level 1 financial instruments for enexis this means that the fair
value is based on listed prices in an active market the other loans concern level 2 financial
instruments this means that for enexis the fair value is based on the discounting of the
nominal cash flows at applicable market discounting curves

be convertible into equity in the event of a structural capital shortage enexis holding nv has
the right to request the lender to convert the loan completely or partially in equity of enexis
holding nv this in the event that this is necessary in the opinion of enexis holding nv and
endorsed by the supervisory board this request should be made with an eye to the
continuity of exercising its tasks as grid operator and in accordance with the requirements of
the energy regulations as lenders the shareholders have the obligation to cooperate with the
requested conversion if there is a structural shortage of capital only insofar as conversion is
necessary to enable enexis holding nv or enexis bv to structurally comply with the financial
ratios required by law or by its bankers

as practically all of the borrowed capital has a fixed interest rate the interest rate sensitivity
for each basis point 001 increase or decrease of the base interest rate relative to the base
rate at yearend is not material

group funding
group funding takes place within the enexis group which means that enexis holding nv
raises the necessary funding for the whole enexis group in the external capital market and
money market as well as if necessary makes use of credit facilities agreed with banks

the externally raised funding is lent on to other group companies intercompany and settled
via the bank accounts of the group companies and included in the joint cash pools interest
and balance compensation takes place within the cash pools notional cash pooling the cash
pool structure satisfies the statutory requirements for the group funding of grid companies

distinction is made between the regulated and nonregulated activities for the funding
conditions and interest rates of intercompany loans group funding for nonregulated
activities takes place at conditions and interest rates on an at arms length basis group
funding for regulated activities takes place based on equal conditions and interest rates
comparable with the externally raised funding by enexis holding nv enexis holding nv and
enexis bv  as grid operator with the regulated activities both have the same credit ratings

foreign exchange rate risk
enexis may be exposed to foreign exchange rate risk on the issue of financial instruments and
when making purchases in currencies other than the euro it is enexiss policy to hedge both
the foreign exchange rate and the interest rate risk immediately upon the issue of financial
instruments denominated in other currencies in the case of investments or larger purchases
denominated in other currencies with an equivalent value exceeding eur 250000 it will be
examined whether the foreign exchange rate risk should be fixed directly

the total amount of cash and cash equivalents receivables and liabilities held in foreign
currencies at the end of 2016 amounted to zero which means that foreign exchange rate risks
and sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations were not relevant

commodity prices risk
for the enexis group this refers to the risk of changes in commodity prices in particular in
connection with the purchase of energy for grid losses at enexis bv this risk is largely hedged
through price fixing by means of forward purchases in which the predicted volumes have
already been purchased at the beginning of the year this purchasing method ensures a


                                                                                             enexis  annual report 2016           113

annual report   notes to the consolidated financial statements



predictable result and is only sensitive to volume differences and unpredictable price
differences for regular buying and selling activities during a distribution year the purchasing
risk is reduced by spreading the purchasing at fixed prices over a period of approximately two
years prior to the date of actual settlement no use is made of derivatives in connection with
the purchase of energy for grid losses

credit risk
the credit risk is the risk of sustaining a loss in the event that a counter party is unable or
unwilling to fulfil its obligations the majority of the activities of enexis holding nv and its
group companies are regulated the debtor risks in regulated markets are lower than the
debtor risks in liberalised energy markets for all lowvolume debtors with regard to the to be
paid grid payments the receivables are collected by the energy suppliers who bear the debtor
risk with regard to the end customer however enexis bv does have a debtor risk with regard
to the energy suppliers

the maximum credit risk is in principle equal to the carrying amount of the receivables and
current assets

liquidity surpluses are placed at market terms and conditions with financial institutions and
investment funds that are subject to the supervision of a central bank or legally appointed
supervisor and with dutch national or regional grid operators that satisfy the specified
minimal rating requirements or with the dutch government in securities guaranteed by the
dutch government in addition enexis aims to spread investment risks by observing counter
party limits in combination with minimum rating requirements

solvency and liquidity risk
solvency risk
solvency risk is the risk that enexiss equity or capital base is insufficient to allow it to meet its
obligations in the long term we aim for at least an a rating aa2 with a stable outlook for
both enexis holding nv and enexis bv this objective is monitored on the basis of defined
minimum financial ratios in relation to interest coverage debt coverage and solvency this
credit rating ensures that enexis holding nv has sufficient access to international capital
markets whereby the solvency is safeguarded by monitoring the minimum financial ratios

liquidity risk and contractual term analysis
liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the risk that the enexis group will not be able to meet its shortterm payment
obligations in order to hedge this risk enexis holding nv also has a committed revolving
credit facility rcf of eur 600 million this facility was concluded with a group of eleven
banks and has a term of five years which would end mid2019 enexis holding nv extended
the term by one year in 2015 to mid2020 the term of the rcf with 10 participating banks for
an amount of eur 545 million was extended in 2016 by one year up to mid2021

enexis holding nv did not make use of the rcf in 2016 however enexis retains this facility
for any unforeseen liquidity requirements in order to retain the rcf enexis holding nv has
contractual obligations to the participating banks in addition to an availability fee these

obligations mainly concern providing information to the banks involved satisfying the usual
financial covenants and other for these facilities customary general covenants such as pari
passu and negative pledge the rcf does not have any financial covenants

furthermore enexis holding nv and its group companies have brought together all bank
accounts in two cash pools a committed credit facility of eur 20 million has been made
available to one of these cash pools

enexis holding nv had a consolidated positive cash balance of eur 34 million on balance at
the end of 2016 eur 148 million positive and eur 114 million negative yearend 2015 on

crossborder lease cbl developments in 2016
all cbls originally entered into by essentenexis were terminated voluntarily a number of
years ago for the time being the existing crossguarantee structure between essent and
enexis bv has remained intact in connection with the possible accrued liabilities and expenses
after termination this entails both parties standing as guarantors for the us investors in the
discontinued commercial and grid cbls

for a specific time after termination of the last crossborder lease cbl in 2012 there was the
possibility of subsequent invoices for the termination and settlement of the cbls as well as a
very low risk of claims arising from accrued liabilities known as the surviving obligations
the possible additional costs and the risks of claims for these cbl terminations are currently
estimated at nil as a result of which the cbl fund intended to cover these costs was paid
out to rwe and shareholders of enexis holding nv in the first half of 2016

remuneration policy for the executive board
the remuneration policy for the executive board of enexis holding nv was adopted by the
general meeting of shareholders on 5 december 2012 and came into effect on 1 january 2013

as the remuneration level for positions of a comparable complexity and social impact is
substantially higher than the absolute maximum standard of the wnt the decision was taken
to set the remuneration of the executive board of enexis at the maximum level permitted by
the wnt a variable remuneration has not been included in the remuneration policy of the
executive board

pension scheme
the members of the executive board participate in the pension scheme that has been
placed with the stichting pensioenfonds abp the dutch pension fund for employees in
the government public and education sectors in accordance with the pension
regulations applicable to the employees and members of the executive board of enexis
the executive board members are required to pay a personal contribution for participation
in the pension scheme

other terms and conditions of employment

and utilities companies enb and collective labour agreement of enexis bv which are both
applicable to the employees of enexis also apply to the executive board subject however
to compliance with the stipulations in the wnt relevant employment benefits arising from

concluded for a fixed term a policy with employment contracts for an indefinite period
suffices there are sufficient opportunities to take measures in the event of an inadequate
performance of executive board members severance payments in the event of an inadequate
performance are determined based on a court ruling

the basis for our opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with dutch law including the dutch standards on
auditing and the audit protocol wnt our responsibilities under those standards are
further described in the section our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
of our report

independence
we are independent of enexis holding nv in accordance with the verordening inzake de
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten vio and other relevant
independence requirements in the netherlands furthermore we have complied with the
verordening gedrags en beroepsregels accountants vgba

we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our opinion

our audit approach
overview and context
enexis holding nv is a network group responsible for construction maintenance
management and development of its electricity and gas transmission grids in the provinces
groningen drenthe overijssel noordbrabant and limburg and related activities our audit is
designed and executed by one central team from a consolidated perspective whereby
accountingwise we consider the group to be one entity

we designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material
misstatement in the financial statements in particular we looked at areas where management
made subjective judgements for example in respect of significant transactions and accounting
estimates that required making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently
uncertain such as the assumptions underlying the valuation of property plant and equipment
and intangible fixed assets receivables provisions and revenues we also focussed on
elements of special importance due to the regulated environment in which the group
operates as for instance the regulated revenues from transportation and connection services
to customers for gas and electricity

in paragraph 24 of the financial statements the company describes the areas of judgment in
applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty given the
significant estimation uncertainty in the valuation of property plant and equipment ppe and
intangible fixed assets and the recognition and disclosures of the acquisition of endinet groep
bv and the sale of assets and liabilities relating to the network parts friesland and
noordoostpolder we considered these to be key audit matters as set out in the key audit
matter section of this report

last year we also included claims and legal issues as key audit matter mainly caused by a
significant claim from market participants given the current status and legal progression of
this matter during 2016 this was no longer a key audit matter




                                                                                          enexis  annual report 2016  138

                                                                                                                    b138   f140

besides the key audit matters it has been an other areas of focus the group is highly
dependent on its it infrastructure for the continuity of its operations we assessed the
reliability and continuity of the automated data processing to the extent relevant for
our audit of the 2016 financial statements for this purpose we involved our internal
it specialists and made use of amongst others data analyses relating to transactions
andor processes in the areas of logical access security procurement asset management
and journal entry processing

as in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls
including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by management that may represent a
risk of material misstatement due to fraud

we ensured that the audit team included the appropriate skills and competences which are
needed for the audit of a network operator we therefore included specialists in the areas of
it regulation and taxes and valuation experts in our team all audit work for the group is
conducted by the same audit team

the outlines of our audit approach were as follows

                            materiality
                             overall materiality 13 million representing 5 of profit before tax

        materiality
                            scope of the audit
                             we conducted our audit work almost entirely at the head office of the group
                              at shertogenbosch whereby we designed and executed our audit from a
                              consolidated perspective
       scope of
       the audit
                            key audit matters
                             valuation of property plant and equipment ppe and intangible fixed assets
                             recognition and disclosures of the acquisition of endinet groep bv and
                              the sale of assets and liabilities relating to the network parts friesland and
        key points            noordoostpolder as at 1 january 2016




materiality
the scope of our audit is influenced by the application of materiality which is further
explained in the section our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

we set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality these together with qualitative
considerations helped us to determine the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures
on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of
identified misstatements on our opinion




                                                                                             enexis  annual report 2016  139

based on our professional judgement we determined the materiality for the financial
statements as a whole as follows
overall group materiality                13 million 2015 15 million
how we determined it                    5 of profit before tax
rationale for benchmark applied         we have applied this benchmark a generally accepted auditing practice based on our analysis
                                        of the common information needs of users of the financial statements on this basis we believe
                                        that financial return and thus profit before tax is an important metric for the financial performance
                                        of the company

we also take misstatements andor possible misstatements into account that in our
judgement are material for qualitative reasons

we agreed with the supervisory board that we would report to them misstatements
identified during our audit above  650000 2015 750000 as well as misstatements below
that amount that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons

the scope of our group audit
enexis holding nv is the parent company of a group of entities the financial information of
this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of enexis holding nv

it is important to note that the groups activities all take place in the netherlands and that the
financial accounting and internal controls are to a great extent centralized our audit is
therefore designed and executed from a consolidated perspective whereby accountingwise
we consider the group to be one entity this means that the scope of our audit included all
transaction flows and financial positions that are of material relevance for the consolidated
financial statements as a whole

further we have audited the consolidation of the group and the disclosures in the financial
statements we paid specific attention to the acquisition of endinet groep bv and the sale
of the assets and liabilities of the network parts of friesland and noordoostpolder as at
1 january 2016

by performing the procedures above we have obtained sufficient and appropriate audit
evidence regarding the financial information of the group to provide a basis for our opinion
on the consolidated financial statements

key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgement were of the most
significance in the audit of the financial statements we have communicated the key audit matters
to the supervisory board but they are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters that were
identified by our audit and that we discussed we described the key audit matters and included
a summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters

the key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements
as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon we do not provide a separate opinion on these
matters or on specific elements of the financial statements any comments we make on the
results of our procedures should be read in this context




                                                                                                        enexis  annual report 2016  140

as part of the preparation of the financial statements management is responsible for
assessing the companys ability to continue as a going concern based on the financial
reporting frameworks mentioned management should prepare the financial statements using
the goingconcern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the

should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the companys
ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements

the supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the companys financial reporting process

our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement to obtain sufficient and
appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion our audit opinion aims to

misstatement reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance which
makes it possible that we may not detect all misstatements misstatements may arise due to
fraud or error

they are considered to be material if individually or in the aggregate they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
the financial statements

statements 2016 of enexis holding nv
in addition to what is included in our auditors report we have further set out in this
appendix our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what
an audit involves

the auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
we have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism
throughout the audit in accordance with dutch standards on auditing and the audit protocol
wnt ethical requirements and independence requirements our objectives are to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement whether due to fraud or error our audit consisted among others of
the following
ċċ identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
   whether due to fraud or error designing and performing audit procedures responsive to
   those risks and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
   basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud
   is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion forgery
   intentional omissions misrepresentations or the intentional override of internal control
ċċ obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
   audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of
   expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control
ċċ evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
   accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management
ċċ concluding on the appropriateness of managements use of the goingconcern basis of
   accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained concluding whether a material
   uncertainty exists related to events andor conditions that may cast significant doubt on
   the companys ability to continue as a goingconcern if we conclude that a material
   uncertainty exists we are required to draw attention in our auditors report to the related
   disclosures in the financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate to modify our
   opinion our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
   auditors report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a
   whole however future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue
   as a going concern
ċċ evaluating the overall presentation structure and content of the financial statements
   including the disclosures and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the
   underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation




                                                                                        enexis  annual report 2016  144

considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the companys consolidated
financial statements we are responsible for the direction supervision and performance of the
group audit in this context we have determined the nature and extent of the audit
procedures for components of the group to ensure that we performed enough work to be
able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole determining factors are the
geographic structure of the group the significance andor risk profile of group entities or
activities the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which the group operates

we communicate with the supervisory board regarding among other matters the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit

we provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where
applicable related safeguards

from the matters communicated with the supervisory board we determine those matters
that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period
and are therefore the key audit matters we describe these matters in our auditors report
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when in extremely
rare circumstances not communicating the matter is in the public interest

assurance report of
the independent auditor
to the executive board of enexis holding nv

assurance report on the sustainability
information 2016
our conclusion
based on our review nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
sustainability information as included in the annual report 2016 of enexis holding nv does
not present in all material respects a reliable and adequate view of
ċċ the policy and business operations with regard to sustainability and
ċċ the events and achievements related thereto for the year ended 31 december 2016
   in accordance with the sustainability reporting guidelines version g4 of gri and
   the internally applied reporting criteria

what we have reviewed
the sustainability information contains a representation of the policy and business operations
of enexis holding nv shertogenbosch hereafter enexis regarding sustainability and the
events and achievements related thereto for 2016
we have reviewed the sustainability information for the year ended 31 december 2016
as included in the following sections in the annual report 2016 hereafter the sustainability
information
ċċ about enexis page 3  15
ċċ report 2016 with the exception of paragraph 8 economic performance
   page 16  39 and 44  50 and
ċċ other page 150  171

the sustainability information contains several references to external sources or websites
and are no part of the sustainability information assessed by us therefore we do not
provide assurance over information outside of the sustainability information




                                                                                        enexis  annual report 2016  146

auditors report   assurance report



the basis for our conclusion
we conducted our review in accordance with dutch law including dutch standard 3810n
assuranceopdrachten inzake maatschappelijke verslagen this review engagement is aimed
to obtain limited assurance our responsibilities under this standard are further described
in the section our responsibilities for the review of the sustainability information of
this assurancereport

independence and quality control
we are independent of enexis in accordance with the verordening inzake de
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten vio and other
relevant independence requirements in the netherlands furthermore we have complied
with the verordening gedrags en beroepsregels accountants vgba

we apply the nadere voorschriften accountantskantoren ter zake van assurance opdrachten
raaa and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including
documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements
professional standards and other applicable legal and regulatory requirements

we believe that the assurance information we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our conclusion

reporting criteria
enexis developed its reporting criteria on the basis of the sustainability reporting guidelines
version g4 of gri as disclosed in section about this report page 164  168 of the annual
report 2016 the information in the scope of this assurance engagement needs to be read
and understood in conjunction with these reporting criteria the executive board is
responsible for selecting and applying these reporting criteria the absence of a significant
body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure nonfinancial
information allows for different but acceptable measurement techniques and can affect
comparability between entities and over time

inherent limitations
the sustainability report includes prospective information such as expectations on
ambitions strategy plans estimates and risk assessments based on assumptions inherently
the actual results are likely to differ from these expectations due to changes in assumptions
these differences may be material we do not provide any assurance on the assumptions
and achievability of prospective information in the sustainability information

responsibilities for the sustainability reporting
and the assurance engagement
responsibilities of the executive board
the board of directors of enexis is responsible for the preparation of the sustainability report
in accordance with the sustainability reporting guidelines version g4 of gri and the internally
applied reporting criteria as disclosed on page 164  168 of the annual report 2016 including
the identification of stakeholders and the definition of material subjects the choices made
by the executive board regarding the scope of the sustainability information and the reporting
policy are summarized in section about this report page 151  157 the executive board
is responsible for determining that the applicable reporting criteria are acceptable in
the circumstances

the executive board is also responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary
to enable the preparation of the sustainability information that is free from material
misstatement whether due to fraud or errors

our responsibilities for the review of the sustainability
information
our responsibility is to plan and perform the review engagement to obtain sufficient and
appropriate assurance information to provide a basis for our conclusion

this review engagement is aimed at obtaining limited assurance in obtaining a limited level
of assurance the performed procedures are aimed at determining the plausibility of
information and are less extensive than those aimed at obtaining reasonable assurance in an
audit engagement the performed procedures in this context consisted mainly of gathering
information from the companys employees and applying analytical procedures set out in
relation to the information included in the sustainability information the assurance obtained
in review engagements aimed at obtaining limited assurance is therefore significantly
lower than the assurance obtained in assurance engagements aimed at obtaining
reasonable assurance

misstatements may arise due to fraud or error and are considered to be material if individually
or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of users
taken on the basis of the sustainability information the materiality affects the nature timing
and extent of our review and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on
our conclusion




                                                                                         enexis  annual report 2016  148

transparency
our stakeholders as we do ourselves consider transparency to be very important
with regard to reporting we have the ambition to rank among the top companies in the
transparency benchmark of the ministry of economic affairs and to maintain the gri g4 level
in the coming year we apply the transparency guidelines and the corporate governance
code insofar as applicable stakeholders have an important position in determining the
contents and scope of our reporting the determination of material topics is a central issue
in enexiss stakeholder dialogue

the scope of the top 10 material topics on which we report in this report generally exceed
the limits of our own organisation
ċċ the topic safety concerns both our own personnel and the personnel of contractors
   as well as public safety
ċċ the measures that we take for the reliability and sustainability of the energy supply
   are essential to fulfil our public task
ċċ we improve our internal processes and ict in order to improve customer satisfaction
ċċ we innovate to ensure that the energy grids and the services that we provide to customers
   are future proof
ċċ we ensure that the energy supply remains affordable and accessible for customers and
   market parties
ċċ themes that focus mainly on the internal organisation are change capacity of the
   organisation economic performance compliance with laws and regulations and the impact
   of our own business operations in addition these topics are discussed with stakeholders
   including the works council shareholders and supervisors

determining the contents materiality
we asked our stakeholders about which topics we should report in this report ten material
themes were selected based on this and this list forms the basis for the annual report
the report has been set up in such a manner that we report on each material theme about
the developments that took place in 2016

we realigned the materiality analysis with our stakeholders in 2016 first we drew up an initial
list ourselves with material topics after an internal prioritisation in the strategic management
consultation the ten high materiality topics were put before the stakeholders via an online
questionnaire finally the top ten material topics were discussed and assessed further with
the stakeholders during a stakeholder meeting on 4 july 2016

the stakeholder groups were also adjusted compared to the previous materiality analyses
new stakeholder groups replaced the relatively broadly defined stakeholder group society

dialogue with stakeholders
a new classification of the stakeholder groups was defined and approved by the management
consultation in 2016 the stakeholder groups customers employees and shareholders
remained unchanged however the original stakeholder group society was deemed to be too
broad this stakeholder group was therefore split into investors policymakers interest groups
market and chain parties and local energy partners there are now in total eight stakeholder
groups the adjustment of the stakeholder model was the result of the strategic reorientation

the overview below shows in general lines who the dialogue with stakeholders was
embedded however it is not an exhaustive summary the most important discussion points
are formulated according to material themes

measuring methods and data collection
where possible we derived the quantitative information in this report for enexiss systems
internal control measures apply for these systems the external reporting  accounting
department of finance is responsible  with the involvement of the business controllers  for
the collection and substantiation of nonfinancial data
ċċ the gri index is included in the paragraph other
ċċ the measuring method for our co2 emissions remained unchanged in 2016 however we do
   make use of a classification in scope 1 2 and 3 to make our results better comparable with
   other companies in our sector

the staff members in the organisation who are responsible for the various topics have
provided and substantiated the qualitative information we have complete confidence in the
general reliability of the reported information however we acknowledge that some of the
information could contain uncertainties that are inherent in the limitations of measuring
methods and the collection of data

management approach corporate social
responsibility csr
within enexis corporate social responsibility csr is integrated into the regular business
operations and objectives for instance the management steered on sustainability objectives
in 2016 for buurkracht and the reduction of co2 in connection with leased vehicles and
claimed kilometres in addition to aiming for a reliable affordable safe and sustainable grid
there is also attention within enexis for good employership and sustainable employability of
our employees

in the paragraph impact own operations an explanation has been included regarding the
manner in which the topic sustainability has been embedded the paragraph change capacity
of the organisation contains an explanation regarding sustainable employability in addition
an elaboration of the management approach with regard to each social theme based on the
guideline iso 26000 can be found in the csr principles on the enexis website this csr policy

in a sustainability agenda a mediumlong term plan that gives direction in terms of activities
and interimobjectives we stopped this plan at the end of 2016 and a status update and
reflection was held on this plan we will focus on our realigned strategy in 2017 and the
accompanying objectives whereby we aim to form an example in sustainability and accelerate
the energy transition

on reporting on this in more detail in the coming years

   mv grid



enexis has a connection obligation for the distribution of electricity everybody is connected
to the electricity grid there is also a connection obligation for gas there is an exception for
lowvolume users in unprofitable areas and areas with a heating grid

fines
no significant fines were received at the departments legal and general affairs jaz
and other relevant departments in 2016 with regard to the services provided by enexis
noncompliance with the eact and the gact environmental laws or laws and regulations
regarding the delivery and use of products and services

co2 footprint
our co2 footprint is mainly determined by our grid losses we consider it important to
reduce our grid losses and to increase our sustainability and we aim to reduce our
co2 footprint in the coming years by doing this we try to reduce other grid losses by
working together in the sector and in the chain the objective of our sustainable mobility
policy is reducing and greening of the mobility of employees you will find an explanation
about this in the paragraph impact of the own business operations

we present our footprint in this annual report in accordance with the international
greenhouse gas ghg protocol divided over three scopes scope 1 and 2 are always
mandatory for reporting this year we are explicitly reporting scope 3 other indirect
emissions with our co2 footprint we have compensated part of our chain emissions resulting


                                                                                               enexis  annual report 2016               161

                                                                                                                b161   f163




other   facts and figures



from enexis activities in the past year we reported the chain emissions waste and grid
components separately therefore we have calculated our co2 footprint for 2015 as a
comparison our total footprint 2015 increased including these components from 83528 tons
to 121077 tons of co2 new in the footprint for scope 3 is the use of data centres at kpn in
the category ict the chain emission was calculated by kpn at enexiss request in the coming
year we will try and report more components that fall under scope 3

all greenhouse gases are reported in co2 equivalents besides co2 methane and sf6
emissions are also reported the conversion factors into co2 equivalents are derived from
the ipcc fourth assessment report we have obtained the emission factors from the source
wwwco2emissiefactorennl

scope 1 direct emissions of our own activities including the emission of our company
vehicles and the energy consumption of our buildings
sustainability aspects were included in the accommodation policy for instance we want our
new offices to be built sustainably and to be energy neutral on balance we opened our
sustainably renovated interregional office in zwolle and the sustainable distribution centre in
veldhoven in 2016

scope 2 indirect emissions of activities own operations including the emissions that
occur when generating electricity leakage and grid losses
energy is always lost in the distribution of electricity for example due to electric
resistance we are working on technical improvements in our grids every year in order
to reduce emissions

enexis operates in accordance with the trias energetica principle for the energy consumption
this means as much use as possible is made of sustainable energy the negative environmental
effects of our emissions are compensated and as a result enexis is net emission neutral
in 2016 we have
ċċ greened 65 of the leakage losses via guarantees of origin of dutch wind and 935 via
   guarantees of origin of scandinavian hydroelectricity power stations
ċċ used 100 green energy from dutch biomass for the electricity supply in our buildings
ċċ compensated remaining emissions with the purchase of gold standard certificates

in 2023 we aim to ensure that more than 40 of our grid losses are generated sustainably
with sustainable energy additionally generated in the netherlands

scope 3 other indirect emissions including the emissions of transport outsourced
production and waste processing
we also feel responsible for the emissions in the chain such as in connection with the
production of cables and pipelines and the processing of waste we started making an
inventory of part of our chain emissions in 2016 in this inventory we make use of data
regarding the co2 emissions of our chain partners such as our it supplier the co2 emissions
in connection with ict 713 tons was completely reduced as kpn makes use of 100 green
electricity generated in the netherlands

other   facts and figures



there are no sector models for the calculation of chain emissions resulting from the
production of machinery and equipment by suppliers and from the processing of company
waste by the waste processor enexis makes use of the suez model for co2 from waste for
this that was developed by ce delft

we aim to report the chain emissions in more detail in 2017
