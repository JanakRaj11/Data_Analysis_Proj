                          what we have achieved in structural reforms so far
                          since launching our 2012 mediumterm business plan 1 we have carried out a largescale program
                          of structural reforms and reform initiatives which continue today to give some background as to




                                                                                                                                                                                                                              value creation through our business
                          why such reforms were needed we must look back to the 1990s until then mhi group had continued
                          to grow thanks to domestic demand driven by the growth of the japanese economy however
                          with the collapse of the bubble economy japans economy slipped into a prolonged phase of slow
                          growth and as a consequence our own growth dropped off in response we attempted to find
                          breakthrough solutions but through the first decade of the new millennium we were unable to
                          implement radical measures to turn around businesses with worsening earnings and languishing
                          domestic investment
                             as the domestic market for our products reached maturity and demand dropped off mhi group
                          had to shift its sights to overseas markets in an unprecedented way to return to a positive growth
                          trajectory as expected we faced a completely different level of competition in overseas markets




                                                                                                                                                                                                                              corporate governance
                          compared to the japanese market the risks were greater as well and for that reason it became
                          imperative that we undertake reforms in our management policies business execution practices
                          and business administration processes we also needed to rethink our corporate culture itself
                          clearly companies that have a strong presence in the face of global competition are those that
                          benefit from scale merits as they skillfully manage their risks

    two overriding targets scale expansion and profitability enhancement specifically we consolidated
    what had been separate business headquarters and regional offices to a structure consisting only
    of business headquarters furthermore we reorganized the business headquarters into larger
    business domains this restructuring move gave us greater freedom in using our management
