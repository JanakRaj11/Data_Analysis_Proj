preserving the planet

responsible operations
reducing our companywide carbon footprint
while our ultimate goal is to be climateneutral our ﬁrst priority is to reduce our total greenhouse gas
ghg emissions by lowering the energy intensity of our operations xerox is ﬁnding success with the
following approaches


     shifts toward energyefﬁcient technologies such as emulsion aggregation ea toner which is
     estimated to generate 28 percent fewer ghg emissions in the manufacturing process than
     conventional toner
     process improvements including using digital multifunction systems in our workplaces instead of
     standalone printers copiers fax machines and scanners
     energy management and equipment upgrades such as utilizing outdoor pipes to cool process water
     in winter months rather than powered industrial chillers and replacing outdated heating and
     cooling systems with energyefﬁcient and digitally controlled models
     use of renewable energy sources to power our facilities our uk facilities are entirely powered by
     green energy or to offset energy use our webster new york wilsonville oregon and dallas
     texas facilities in the united states voluntarily use renewable energy or credits to offset a portion
     of electricity consumption
     efﬁciencypromoting initiatives including purchasing energyefﬁcient lighting and vehicles reducing
     packaging sizes mileage tracking and route efﬁciencies

energy goal 2020
in 2003 we made a public commitment to reduce ghg emissions  our carbon footprint  by joining
the us epa climate leaders program and launching an internal program known as energy challenge
2012


this 10year initiative set a goal to reduce ghg emissions across all company operations by 10 percent
by 2012 we met this target six years ahead of schedule so we set a new target of 25 percent
reduction by 2012 from a 2002 baseline at the conclusion of the program we successfully cut
emissions by 42 percent  thats 210000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents co2e  and reduced
energy consumption by 31 percent


our new corporatewide goal is to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by 2020 from a 2012
baseline in 2015 we reduced energy consumption by 12 percent and cut emissions by 20 percent 
thats 65000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents co2e


excludes data centers numbers energy challenge 2012 included ﬂeet and facilities for the technology business and
services where colocated energy goal 2020 encompasses all parts of our business



energy consumption




energy and ghg emissions totals are associated with fuel consumption by companyowned ﬂeet and natural
gaselectricity consumption in facilities vendor invoices from utility and fuel providers are the preferred source of data
when unavailable estimations have been used


in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol and to make annual data comparable we adjust the energy and
emissions data each year as a result of the opening and closing of facilities and more appropriate emission factors that
are available




                                                                                                                               35137

greenhouse gas inventory
in keeping with the international guidelines of the greenhouse gas protocol developed by the world
resources institute and the world business council for sustainable development we track the six major
ghgs carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o hydroﬂuorocarbons hfcs
perﬂuorocarbons pfcs and sulfur hexaﬂuoride sf6 we express our carbon footprint in terms of
carbon dioxide equivalents co2e


energy sources account for more than 99 percent of our ghg emissions our ghg inventory includes
direct emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels primarily natural gas and indirect emissions from
purchased electricity and steam at our manufacturing sites ofﬁces and warehouses the inventory also
includes the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuels in our service and sales vehicle ﬂeet


in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol inventory adjustments are completed each year as a
result of the opening and closing of facilities and changes to the vehicle ﬂeet as reﬂected in energy
consumption and ghg emission charts we have expanded our ghg tracking to include scope 3
emissions from employee business travel product transport employee commute and waste generated in
operations


in 2015 xerox ghg emissions totaled 261071 metric tons of co2e about 57 percent were indirect
emissions from purchased electricity and steam the remaining 43 percent were direct emissions from
the combustion of natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel xeroxowned or leased facilities such as
manufacturing sites ofﬁces and warehouses are associated with 54 percent of our direct ghg
emissions the remaining 46 percent are direct emissions from our service and sales vehicle ﬂeet and
other mobile sources

energy and ghg emissions totals are associated with fuel consumption by companyowned ﬂeet and natural
gaselectricity consumption in facilities vendor invoices from utility and fuel providers are the preferred source of data
when unavailable estimations have been used


in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol and to make annual data comparable we adjust the energy and
emissions data each year as a result of the opening and closing of facilities and more appropriate emission factors that
are available


the assessment of scope 3 emissions poses many challenges due to the large number of variables the
difﬁculty in collecting data from suppliers and increasing uncertainty in the data as the sources become
further removed from the company we have begun calculating scope 3 emissions according to the wri
scope 3 accounting standard we will use the information to prioritize our ghg emission reduction
opportunities and to integrate consideration of carbon impact into sourcing and internal decision
making


our scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 ghg emissions have been veriﬁed by a third party

climate change risks and opportunities
xerox has examined the regulatory physical and commercial risks and opportunities associated with
climate change across our value chain


we assess and manage our carbon risk by maintaining both a robust ghg emissions inventory and a
mature regulatory tracking function that provides the necessary information to stay abreast of
developing regulation we do not consider our company to be subject to unique risks due to changing
weather patterns rising temperatures and sea levels but we recognize that our business could be
impacted by more frequent disruptions as a result of severe weather in locations where we operate we
may also need to invoke our business continuity and resumption plans to aid customers who are
impacted by business disruptions due to severe weather were experienced in working with customers
to ensure continuity of critical applications by prioritizing business needs and developing customer
speciﬁc preparedness plans where appropriate our business resumption plans include communication
with employees and customers management of employee health and safety issues business continuity
and resumption processes and interaction with government organizations


we recognize that the increasing costs of energy and concerns around energy security are issues that
affect both our operations and those of our customers our commitment to reduce energy use in our
operations was driven in part by cost savings and we recognized that helping our customers to reduce
energy costs through more efﬁcient document solutions could increase our revenues


our immediate shortterm focus is reducing energy consumption in our own operations as we make
progress toward achieving our corporate goal of 20 percent reduction by 2020 we strive to provide
sustainable document management technology solutions to our customers to reduce the energy and
environmental impacts of their business


to meet our commitment for reducing energy use and protecting the climate our longterm more
than threeyear strategy is to continue to invest in technologies that reduce the carbon footprint of our
operations and develop technology solutions that help our customers to reduce the energy and
environmental impacts of their business our ultimate aim is to be carbonneutral


we invest in innovation market leadership and sound management practices that deliver measurable
beneﬁts to the environment our customers and society and that also increase shareholder value we
recognize the importance of creative partnerships with suppliers customers and other stakeholders to
achieve these beneﬁts and maximize their value being smart with product innovation is an important
part of sector leadership


we are well positioned for current and potential future regulation by our investment in a robust ghg
emission inventory we are currently gathering scope 3 emissions data and other key metrics to assess
climate change risk in the supply chain




                                                                                                             38137

preserving clean air and water


air emissions
xerox has signiﬁcantly reduced manufacturing air emissions over the past 20 years continuous
improvement remains a priority


most of our air emissions originate from the production of imaging supplies such as toner
photoreceptor drums and belts and fuser rolls approximately 22 tonnes of volatile organic process air
emissions voc and nonvoc were released to the atmosphere from these production activities in
2015 emission reductions over time have primarily come from process modiﬁcation lower production
volumes of legacy products coated using organic solvents and production declines attributable to
longerlife components


volatile organic process air emissions




20132014 emissions have been revised in this report to reﬂect the inclusion of brazilian photoreceptor emissions which
are now quantiﬁed on the basis of annual monitoring and relatively small amounts of byproduct emissions that were
better quantiﬁed in 2015


a subset of these volatile organic process emissions is deﬁned by the us environmental protection
agency epa as hazardous air pollutants hap in 2015 xerox reported worldwide air emissions of
approximately 5 metric tons of hap under national toxic chemical release regulations including the
united states toxics release inventory tri program methylene chloride methyl isobutyl ketone
mibk 13butadiene and styrene represent virtually all of these hap emissions




                                                                                                                           39137

ozonedepleting substances
xerox policy prohibits the use of ozonedepleting substances ods as ingredients in products spare
parts accessories and packaging ozonedepleting substances are used as refrigerants in facility and
vehicle air conditioning systems and various foodequipmentcooling systems although ods may be
released during the normal operation and failure of these systems the total amount released is not
signiﬁcant from a companywide perspective elimination of ods as refrigerant is managed consistent
with government phaseout dates


toxic chemical releases
the release of materials used in our worldwide operations is evaluated annually and reported to
government agencies under national toxic chemical release reporting regulations such as the us toxics
release inventory the canadian national pollutant release inventory and the european pollutant
release and transfer register releases for reporting year 2015 were 14 percent lower than 2014 levels
and 75 percent lower than 2007 levels in 2015 reportable releases and transfers decreased primarily
due to decreases in the amount of organic solvent used in production manufacturing processes




                                                                                                           40137

reportable toxic chemical releases and transfers




in 2011 operations with reportable toxic chemical releases to the air land or water  in amounts of
greater than one metric ton  established goals targets and objectives related to chemical releases
progress against these goals as of yearend 2015 is summarized below


     an initiative to reclaim spent methyl isobutyl ketone mibk continued to exceed expectations in
     the fourth full year of implementation recovered solvent was qualiﬁed for use as a cleaning
     solvent for the ﬂuid delivery systems used in us fuser roll coating operations as a result the
     amount of virgin mibk purchased in 2015 for use in the manufacturing operation has been
     reduced by 36 percent from the 2010 baseline on a normalized perpart basis
     the amount of methylene chloride used to manufacture xerox photoreceptor belts was reduced by
     more than 62 percent from the 2010 baseline greatly exceeding target this dramatic reduction
     was primarily due to volume declines of legacy products and process modiﬁcations that reduced
     the amount of methylene chloride used for batch cleaning of production equipment
     emissions of 13butadiene from us toner resin manufacturing operations slightly exceeded the
     normalized perbatch target in 2015 primarily due to an accidental 14pound release that
     occurred during the year lowemission hose connectors were installed to offset increases in
     transfer losses caused by a more frequent delivery schedule

spills and accidental releases
our goal is to prevent all environmental releases of regulated materials to air soil and water we have
greatly reduced the frequency of spills and accidental releases though we have not yet reached our
target of eliminating these events


in 2015 our north american operations identiﬁed four reportable accidental spillsreleases three events
occurred at our monroe county new york location two of the three were contained and did not reach
the environment one of the events went to a containment system with minimal impact to the



                                                                                                            41137

environment the fourth event occurred at our oklahoma city oklahoma location it was an accidental
release to air that occurred after a maintenance activity corrective measures for all spills and releases
were put in place to minimize the potential for these types of incidents to occur in the future


water consumption and treatment
as part of our commitment to conserve resources we monitor water consumption across our
manufacturing distribution and rd facilities worldwide water consumed by xerox operations is
sourced from local municipal suppliers who withdraw water from the ground lakes rivers or other
surface waters


our current goal is to reduce water consumption by 35 percent by 2020 against a 2010 baseline
water consumption in 2015 was down 38 percent against the 2020 goal


in 2015 a major contributor to reduced water consumption was manufacturing consolidation activities


a pilot program was initiated at our plant in wilsonville oregon to evaluate the use of reverse osmosis
reject water for a secondary purpose the water will be utilized to supply cooling towers at the site
currently this water is sent to the sanitary sewer and ultimately to the publically owned treatment
works projections indicate approximate water savings of up to ﬁve percent of purchased water per year


the water discharges at manufacturing sites are monitored to validate compliance with local sanitary
sewer discharge limits wastewater from manufacturing processes is treated as necessary before being
discharged into local sanitary sewers we utilize best practices to prevent unwanted pollutants from
entering waterways via surface contamination and runoff extensive sampling of wastewater
discharged to both sanitary and storm sewers ensures that discharged water meets our strict
requirements

nonhazardous solid waste
we have had major waste reduction efforts in place for many years we reuse boxes pallets and
containers for parts delivery we recapture toner that is outside the acceptable size range during
manufacturing recycle returned equipment and reuse totes for recycling scrap metal and paper


we have an aspirational goal to drive our reuserecycle rate to 100 by 2020 at our technology
facilities compared to a baseline year of 2009 additionally xerox has committed to developing a
process to collect and track solid waste data at all of our services facilities


our global manufacturing operations and all facilities in monroe county new york generated 47100
metric tons of nonhazardous solid waste in 2015 up slightly from 44000 metric tons in 2014 process
waste consists primarily of paper wood pallets waste toner plastics and packaging waste such as
corrugated cardboard equipment manufacturing waste includes scrap metal waste batteries and lamps
miscellaneous trash and nonusable endoflife equipment and parts that our customers return to xerox
for processing and remanufacturing this waste made up about 71 percent of the nonhazardous solid
waste managed by xerox operations in 2015 xerox is able to reuse or recycle over 98 of the waste
generated from our customer returns


in 2015 we managed 94 percent of nonhazardous solid waste beneﬁcially up from 93 percent in 2014
the increased reuserecycle rate can be attributed to an increase in our manufacturing operations using
energy from waste technology for nonrecyclables in 2015 additionally in 2015 our equipment resellers
were able to return a number of products to the marketplace for resale that resulted in a signiﬁcant
reduction of all nonhazardous waste please note that the reuserecycle rate has been revised from
previous years to more accurately represent nonhazardous waste management methods

environmental remediation and compliance
in 1985 we began a voluntary assessment program that identiﬁed 68 of our worksites requiring
remediation we worked closely with the appropriate federal state and local agencies to initiate prompt
and appropriate measures to ensure the protection of employees neighbors and the environment


today only two of the original 68 sites still require active remedial or control measures we have
removed or greatly reduced the source areas of contamination and have remediated these properties for
reuse or redevelopment our remedial focus is now shifting to establishing the completion of required
post remediation compliance monitoring at sites no longer subject to active remediation so the
regulatory process for managing these sites can ofﬁcially be terminated


in addition to using conventional techniques for groundwater recovery and treatment and soil
excavation we have a history of developing innovative remedial technologies to enhance our remedial
efforts these included techniques that improve and accelerate the recovery of contaminants such as
highvacuum 2phase extraction and enhanced bedrock fracturing we also employ technologies where
contaminants are converted to lessharmful substances through enhanced natural biodegradation and
chemical oxidation


compliance reporting
we require our various operations and subsidiaries worldwide to report allegations of regulatory
violations to our ehss group for tracking evaluation and corrective action where appropriate in 2015
ﬁve instances resulted in a notice of violation two were administrative due to late ﬁling of reports
three others involved exceeding wastewater discharge limits one of which resulted in a penalty all
issues have been abated and closed out with the relevant authorities and weve established appropriate
controls to ensure ongoing compliance

reducing energy use through our products and technology
     energy star
     more than 10 years before the inception of the us environmental protection agency epa
     energy star ofﬁce equipment program xerox introduced the ﬁrst imaging product with an
     automatic powerdown mode since joining with the epa as a charter partner in 1993 we continue
     to introduce copier printer fax and multifunction products that have earned energy star  status
     even as the certiﬁcation criteria have grown more stringent

     in 2015 100 percent of all our new eligible product introductions achieved energy star  this
     continued success in cutting the power consumption of our laserbased printing products has been
     achieved by adjustments in the fuser design changes to the properties of the toner more efﬁcient
     electronic controls and the workings of the xerographic system as a whole

     the energy star program introduces progressively more stringent requirements over time with
     the most recent revision having gone into effect january 1 2014 while the new standard was
     challenging to meet our goal remains to have 100 percent of new product introductions achieve
     this label

     multifunction devices
     our multifunction systems further reduce the amount of energy required to copy print fax and
     scan by combining the functions of multiple products into one machine the annual energy savings
     of replacing several individual energy starqualiﬁed copiers fax machines and printers with one
     xerox energy starqualiﬁed workcentre multifunction system is up to onehalf energy savings
     would be substantially higher if a multifunction system replaces individual products that have not
     earned the energy star rating

     connectkey is a software solution that enables information to be moved to and from the cloud
     without the security risks that commonly exist cloud computing is an alternative to large data
     centers and is being recognized worldwide as less energy intensive than data centers while
     generating fewer greenhouse gas emissions in addition xerox connectkey and cisco energywise
     enable energy management by allowing for control management and reporting of a devices
     power consumption and the setting of power states and timeout intervals

deinkability
in recent years deinkability has become an area of increasing concern particularly among our graphic
communications customers ensuring that prints produced with our equipment and materials can be
responsibly managed at the end of their useful life is an important consideration in our product
development process when appropriate independent testing conﬁrms that these prints pose no unique
challenges to the recycling stream while the deinkability of xerographic prints has long been
demonstrated a key milestone for a new technology came in 2010 when the cipress printer achieved a
good deinkability rating from ingede the international association of the deinking industry

standard  88p311 our commercial equipment is designed and tested extensively to be shipped
without requiring any packaging we strive to eliminate or reduce packaging wherever feasible which
conserves natural resources and decreases fuel use for distribution a sustainability win for business and
the environment


we also offer the xerox automated packaging solution this system uses the latest in document
technology to print ﬁnish and cut customized folding cartons in short runs by creating packaging
quickly and costeffectively this solution enhances materials efﬁciencies as well as decreasing
obsolescence through the creation of customized boxes and containers automated packaging reduces
ﬁnancial and environmental costs associated with warehousing storage and disposal an advantage for
focused marketing campaigns and rapidly changing competitive markets


a few examples that illustrate our commitment to sustainability in this area


developer housing assembly  converting to use of molded pulp
for many years our principal supplier shipped housing assemblies to us packed in foam we moved
production to the us and redesigned the packaging to allow us to take advantage of readily recyclable
molded pulp solutions


the expanded polystyrene endcaps weighing 68 grams each and measuring 5 inches in length 65
inches in width and 6 inches in height per side were replaced with molded pulp endcaps the result was
a decrease in our material footprint large enough to increase the amount of product per unit load from
77 units per pallet to 144 an increase of 87 percent this eliminated 4800 kilograms 10575 lbs and
8559 cubic feet of foam annually reducing costs and also conserving natural resources


workcentre 7120 customer replaceable units crus  reducing our footprint
as with our developer housing assemblies we redesigned packaging provided to us by a large supplier of
color workcentre 7120 crus by removing polystyrene endcaps and reducing the size of the package
the result was a reduction of 4725 kilograms 10417 lbs or 27756 cubic feet of polystyrene waste
annually and a 27 percent increase of product per unit load


xerox replacement cartridges xrc  reducing solid waste
for xrc products xerox packaging engineers replaced hot wire expanded polystyrene endcaps with
inﬂatable air bags upon receipt of the package the air bags are easily deﬂated producing far less solid
waste by mass and cubic volume compared to polystyrene creating an environmentally preferable
alternative


materials
we have made a longterm commitment to eliminate the use of persistent bioaccumulative and toxic
materials throughout our supply chain by applying strict internal standards and by tightly managing




                                                                                                             52137

chemicals in our supply chain our supplier requirements are periodically updated as regulations change
and new information becomes available all new product designs refer to these requirements and
suppliers are expected to verify their compliance with them learn more at wwwxeroxcomenvironment


toxicologists conduct a comprehensive assessment of new materials in our products to ensure
conformance with applicable global registration hazard communication and waste handling and
disposal requirements as a result of our stringent requirements xerox toners and printing products are
noncarcinogenic and nonmutagenic in addition these products do not cause adverse developmental
or reproductive effects pose a toxicity hazard to humans or aquatic species cause a permanent adverse
impact to the skin eyes or respiratory system or have the potential to generate federally regulated
hazardous waste we were the ﬁrst in our industry to evaluate the health effects of toner and did so for
over 30 years


our requirements for minimizing toxic materials govern our product design and materials selection we
have reengineered or eliminated processes to dramatically reduce the use of toxins and heavy metals
and have made substantial progress in eliminating the use of mercury mercurycontaining lamps that
scan images and backlight user displays are being phased out as alternatives become available


our safety and supplier processes enable us to meet global regulations governing chemical use since
2007 xeroxs newly launched products have been designed to meet the european unions restriction of
hazardous substances rohs requirements in all markets however where regulations allow some
products may contain parts with small amounts of rohs substances in order to avoid premature
disposal of existing parts that continue to have usable life similar types of legislation continue to be
implemented in many other market regions through our proactive regulatory tracking process we
expect to be fully compliant with all aspects of these regulations as the provisions become effective and
applicable


in 2015 xerox was informed by two suppliers that certain units of several product families shipped in
the second half of 2014 and in 2015 may not comply with the european unions rohs recast directive
the concern was limited to small plastic parts in some of the affected units containing a small amount
of cadmium which exceeded permitted limits and a small capacitor in other units containing a small
amount of lead also slightly in excess of limits xerox stopped shipment of the affected units within our
control and inventory was reworked with compliant parts affected product already placed at customer
locations is being reworked on a next service call basis for the cadmium containing plastic parts while
the lead in the capacitor is being addressed at machine endoflife there is no customer or employee
exposure or risk in either instance in accordance with applicable regulations xerox selfreported these
nonconformities to the relevant authorities who assessed no penalties


thirdparty supplies sold by xerox
xerox sells imaging supplies through its distribution network that are manufactured by other companies
for use in other oem printers manufacturing processes combine patented and patent pending
technology environmental management principles and proven waste prevention manufacturing and
recycling processes we thoroughly review these supplies to ensure compliance with appropriate
regulatory requirements in addition we also assess against our own stringent standards the results of
these reviews ultimately determine which products carry the xerox brand information is provided on
safety data sheets sds which have been recently updated to meet the requirements of the globally
harmonized system of classiﬁcation and labeling of chemicals ghs as implemented through
regulations in our various markets

endoflife management
our aim is to design products packaging and supplies that make efﬁcient use of resources minimize
waste reuse material where feasible and recycle what cant be reused to meet this commitment we
developed several programs xeroxs green world alliance gwa initiative provides a collection and
reuserecycling program for spent imaging supplies xeroxs product takeback and recycling program
manages equipment at endoflife and we invest in technologies that reduce the creation of waste our
solid ink imaging process utilizes compact cartridgefree solid ink sticks with no plastic housings or
casings thereby reducing printrelated waste by up to 90 percent compared with comparable color laser
products for laserbased products materials innovation has extended the life of critical replaceable
components by up to 50 percent


our approach to managing products at endoflife translates into signiﬁcant environmental and ﬁnancial
beneﬁts globally our combined returns programs equipment resale or remanufacture in conjunction
with parts and consumables reuse and recycling prevented nearly 47500 metric tons of waste from
entering landﬁlls in 2015


consumables takeback and recycling
xeroxs green world alliance gwa initiative provides a collection and reuserecycling program for
spent imaging supplies gwa is central to our commitment to wastefree products


currently more than 35 countries participate in the xerox green world alliance each has its own gwa
country website that describes the processes available to the customer or the appropriate points of
contact for more information worldwide our customers returned over 21 million cartridges toner
containers and other used supply items in 2015 equating to 4400 metric tons


returned products are sorted and items suitable for remanufacturing are cleaned inspected and then
remanufactured remanufactured consumables containing an average 90 percent reusedrecycled parts
are built and tested to the same performance speciﬁcations as new products items that are not
suitable for remanufacturing are recycled or recovered through energy from waste recycled waste toner
and toner reclaimed from manufacturing that qualiﬁes for reuse may account for 25 percent of the
weight of new toner without compromising toner functionality reusing wastereclaimed toner saves
several million dollars in raw material costs each year of the toner that cant be reclaimed 75 percent
is recycled by our consumables recycling partner while the remaining volume is utilized as energy by
waste facilities to generate steam and electricity




                                                                                                            54137

equipment and parts takeback and recycling
in the early 1990s we pioneered the practice of converting endoflife electronic equipment into
products and parts that contain reused parts while meeting newproduct speciﬁcations for quality and
performance we have developed a comprehensive process for taking back endoflife products and have
established a remanufacture parts reuse and recycling program that fully supports our wastefree
initiatives


we design our machines with high durability and reuse capability in order to facilitate multiple product
lifecycles during the active phase of a product all returned equipment and spare parts are evaluated
for reuse opportunities throughout the supply chain finally all parts and equipment that are not
destined for reuse have speciﬁc guidelines which enables easy and consistent recycling


xerox enables reuse according to the following principles


     reuse of complete end item this requires the least reprocessing transportation and energy usage
     remanufacturing or conversion into a newergeneration product or part product families are
     designed with a high level of commonality to enable maximum reuse in this manner this allows
     us to remanufacture to as new performance speciﬁcations while reusing 70 to 90 percent of the
     machine components by weight without degradation of quality or performance
     used equipment equipment returns are evaluated for potential reuse based on the condition and
     market demands equipment may be put through an extended maintenanceveriﬁcation process to
     return it to a high standard and then be redeployed nearly 65 percent of machines returned in
     the us are given new life by being sold as used or sent for remanufacturing
     reuse of major modules subcomponents and parts for spares or manufacturing many of our
     machines that have outlived their useful lives are stripped of usable parts and components prior to
     the scrapreclaim process used spare parts returned from the ﬁeld are also included in this reuse
                                                                                                           55137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report

     stream xerox has been continually increasing the number of components that are reused in
     upstream and downstream processes after the original machine has been designated for recycling
     material recycling after the processes noted above have been followed any remaining portion of a
     machine is stripped of any recyclable material eg plastics copper wire and material requiring
     special disposal services such as printed wiring boards batteries and lamps the remainder of the
     machine is then sent to an industrial reclaim facility


changes in volumes of waste diverted from landﬁlls is due in part to increases in product and reuse
opportunities changes in product mix and a move to lighterweight machines as well as growth of
regulatorydriven local recycling schemes for example the transition to digital equipment and lighter
weight parts has reduced the weight of both ofﬁce and production equipment by as much as 50 percent
over the last 10 years the decline also includes a decrease in the number of ofﬁce machines returned
for remanufacturing in europe due to participation in eu member state waste electrical and electronic
equipment weee programs in geographies where xerox exercises direct control over the endoflife
management of equipment return rates are high for example approximately 60 percent of all us
equipment installs are ultimately returned to xerox for endoflife disposition a ﬁgure that rises to 100
percent for leased equipment


in 2015 9400 metric tons of equipmentparts related waste was diverted from landﬁlls to recycling at
our us reverse logistics center globally that volume rises to 43000 metric tons




                                                                                                             56137

restated in 2016 to reﬂect the current method used to estimate waste that is beneﬁcially managed


ewaste
while xerox has long been committed to responsible endoflife management of equipment the
proliferation of ewaste regulations has created a need for multiple programs in different countries and
even states the subtle differences in requirements among these regulations pose challenges from a
process consistency and efﬁciency standpoint for example with the implementation of the european
unions waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive we continue to operate our
european takeback program to enable equipment remanufacturing and parts reuse we also participate
as needed in european member states individual collection and recycling programs


in the us xerox recently partnered with a large electronics recycler to ensure that our customers have
a means to have their old imaging devices processed in a responsible manner the program is consistent
with the requirements deﬁned in the various manufacturer takeback initiatives


we carefully manage suppliers who provide recycling and waste disposal services a waste vendor
approval process assesses the safety and environmental practices as well as compliance history of each
vendor where appropriate we require these companies to document the ﬁnal disposition of materials
sent to their facilities including electronic scrap xerox does not allow its vendors to send electronic
scrap to developing nations for processing we strive to work with only those recyclers who have
implemented voluntary programs that are certiﬁed by accredited organizations the programs are the
us epas responsible recycling r2 standard for electronics recyclers or the basel action networks e
stewards standards in addition in 2014 xeroxs two us equipment processing facilities achieved r2
certiﬁcation



                                                                                                            57137

paper
we recognize our obligation to responsibly source paper and enable efﬁcient paper use our strategy
begins upstream with the ﬁber source and continues on to processing and manufacturing through use
and endoflife we utilize a multipronged approach through partnerships with our customers and
suppliers the nature conservancy and other stakeholders including nongovernment organizations
ngos government agencies and academia our longterm goal is to support a sustainable paper cycle
and minimize environmental impact while meeting our customers exacting business needs


in 2013 domtar signed an agreement with xerox for the acquisition of the xerox paper and media
products business in united states and canada this deal gives domtar exclusive rights for the
marketing and distribution of xerox brand paper and print media read more about domtar and
sustainability the same year xeroxs paper business in western europe was sold to antalis read more
about antaliss sustainability charter xerox maintains the paper business in its developing market
operations


we apply stringent paper sourcing guidelines for companies that provide paper to xerox for resale the
requirements cover all aspects of papermaking from forest management to production of ﬁnished
goods we supply papers that comply with sustainable forest management standards including the
forest stewardship council fsc and programme for the endorsement of forest certiﬁcation pefc
fsccertiﬁed papers use raw materials from an fsccertiﬁed source controlled wood sources or post
consumer reclaimed sources


we offer papers ranging from 80 to 100 percent postconsumer recycled content our recycled papers
use postconsumer waste andor recycled ﬁber in place of new pulp recycled products are required to
meet the same strict performance speciﬁcations as virgin products and are designed for optimal
performance in our equipment


our partnership with the nature conservancy tnc
since 2006 xerox and the nature conservancy have partnered to conserve and protect globally
important forests this work is supported through xerox foundation grants of over 2 million in 2015
our partnership expanded to include volunteers from xerox and tnc working together in conservation
efforts our partnership builds on the commitment of xerox to sustainability throughout its operations
and corporate leadership on the world stage


during the third term of the partnership in 2015 xerox supported the conservancys efforts to


     develop and test a broadly applicable forest carbon methodology for improved forest management
     that would allow landowners to achieve forest certiﬁcation and serve as a platform for potential
     carbon beneﬁts
     strengthen a key tool for identifying priority habitats  the high conservation value hcv
     approach  building consistency across projects disseminating standards and training assessors
     through global and regional hcv networks
     promote responsible forestry through the implementation of forest management standards by
     working with xerox suppliers and other land managers at two sites in north america central
     western new york and across the canadian boreal forest including a focused project in northwest
     ontario

these initiatives have improved forest conservation helping to develop a sustainable paper cycle and
advance sound forest management practices through market incentives landowner investment and
resource networks most importantly our work has and will continue to stem the tide of forest loss and
degradation a contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions

environmental leadership
as innovators who introduced twosided copying in 1970 and as one of the ﬁrst employers to allow
employees to work from home saving fuel and reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions xerox has
operated at the forefront of environmental sustainability our accomplishments span from being the ﬁrst
to make available ofﬁce equipment with an energysaving mode to playing a key role in developing the
innovative transportation solutions of today and tomorrow


in 2015 xerox was one of the ﬁrst organizations to join the road to paris initiative a collaborative
effort of cdp formerly the carbon disclosure project and the we mean business coalition in a similar
initiative supported by the white house xerox signed the american business act on climate pledge
along with dozens of the nations largest companies we committed to further ghg reductions and
energy reductions in our operations globally  an additional 20 percent by 2020 from our 2012
baseline we also committed to continuing to provide products and services to enable our customers to
realize ghg reductions in their workplaces and communities we also committed to investing in clean
energy for our facilities


assuming a lead role in sustainability requires a focused effort on aspects that will drive the greatest
value to our stakeholders and company we utilize materiality assessments to prioritize this effort in
our most recent assessments we reafﬁrmed that sustainable products and services are a material aspect
for xerox providing value for our company and our stakeholders as an example of one effort to
advance sustainable products we teamed with the university of michigan and other companies to
create mcity  a 32acre simulated urban environment to enable mobility developers to test the
capabilities of connected and automated vehicles and systems in another effort geared for the ofﬁce
we developed digital alternatives and the print awareness tool digital alternatives helps organizations
transition from paperbased tasks to streamlined digital workﬂows increasing the efﬁciency of routine
document processes the xerox print awareness tool provides endusers with graphical displays of their
print usage as well as ecotips to enhance sustainability awareness and choices

and work

communityfocused projects each year in 2015 the xerox foundation invested over 13 million in the

     elementary schools to teach science to inquiring young minds and to ignite interest in science as a
     career

     people across xerox  from the csuite to the factory ﬂoor  volunteer their time to help make
     our world a better place whether by giving their time to a corporate board or by rolling up their
     sleeves and packing boxes for a holiday food and gift drive

organizations where someone from xerox was personally involved

recent voe was administered in october and november of 2015 we received results from 61 countries
in 20 languages sixtysix thousand employees from every division every job function and every job level
shared their thoughts and knowledge




the objectives of the voe were to assess the strength of the workgroupmanager relationship and
provide insight into the things that are working well and highlight opportunities for improvement using
the surveys feedback and insights helps us strengthen the communication channel between employees
and xerox create a better experience with our clients and customers and enable an effective and
motivating work environment where we all can thrive

     risks and personal job satisfaction

employee safety
xerox is committed to maintaining a safe work environment for our people we strive toward a goal of
zero workplace injuries continually decreasing the frequency and severity of injuries every year in 2015
within our global technology operations the total recordable injury tri rate decreased by 7 and day
away from work case dafw rate decreased by 6 from 2014 levels in addition across all of our us
operations the dafw frequency rate decreased by 7 which is reﬂective of success in preventing the
more serious injuries we did experience one work related fatality in 2015 due to a motor vehicle
accident on a public road overall these improvements have continued since 2012 and are a result of
the increased safety awareness and communications to our employees and focused safety management
processes within our management teams

we continued to be successful in integrating many corporate safety management processes into our
services organization including injury recordkeeping workplace inspections ﬁre and life safety
ergonomics and emergency preparedness this integration has established common objectives and
standardized the management processes for key employee safety disciplines


we have in place a robust worldwide incident reporting process this in combination with workplace
safety inspections and hazard analysis focuses our safety improvement efforts where we can have the
most impact on preventing incidents and where populations are most at risk employee safety
communications take a variety of forms given the great diversity in our operations and workplaces a
number of methods are used to keep employee safety awareness high including site speciﬁc hazard
management off the job safety information and unique safety concerns that may be endemic to a
speciﬁc geography


safe facilities
in order to ensure ﬁre and life safety attributes are in place in the buildings we own and lease all real
estate transactions are reviewed by the environment health safety and sustainability ehss
organization prior to occupying xerox ﬁre safety and life safety requirements have been established
regardless of location in the world size of facility or occupancy classiﬁcation the focus of the safety
review is ﬁre and incident prevention early detection suppression occupant notiﬁcation and prompt
emergency response these reviews are linked with the implementation of building speciﬁc emergency
preparedness planning and drills


audit program
a wellestablished internal audit program measures our success in implementing corporate standards
allows us to share best practices and helps us validate regulatory compliance audits at major
operations are conducted on a rolling average of once every three to ﬁve years or sooner based on
performance the frequency and the focus of the audits are based on the type of operations and the
inherent risks associated with the operations in 2012 we added our services operations to this audit
schedule


xerox audit teams evaluate operations against our internal standards external regulations and industry
guidelines beginning in 2010 the teams also evaluated management system performance with the
assistance of the local managers and support staff action plans are developed and deﬁciencies
corrected senior management pays particular attention to situations with the potential to pose a
signiﬁcant risk of environmental damage serious injury to employees or regulatory noncompliance in
2015 we met our goal of resolution of these issues within 90 days and continued to demonstrate that
the audit program has become an important mechanism for identifying and correcting performance
gaps




                                                                                                             81137

establishing an audit process for our services sites
33 countries  215 locations  130 international  85 us 25




adding services to the mix
our services operations are located in approximately 500 sites worldwide initially ehss was engaged
in audits of a limited number of facilities between 2010 and 2012 in 2013 ehss set out to complete
audits of all 130 international services locations and worked with various value chain partners including
global real estate and facilities human resources and local operations management to address any
issues that were identiﬁed


in 2014 and 2015 audits were completed at 85 us locations for a total audit count of 215 in order
to establish a consistent level of ehss performance worldwide a common set of facility requirements
was developed that applies across all geographies taking into account existing life safety and building
codes as well as speciﬁc regulatory requirements that may apply in different parts of the world


the onsite review of these locations provided signiﬁcant insight into the variety of business operations
facility andor management issues and best practices that could be used to improve overall
performance outside of the us due to the large variation in local regulations the audits identiﬁed a
number of sites requiring some sort of physical upgrade modiﬁcation or intervention to meet safety and
environmental requirements corrective actions for all of these locations have been completed


consistent application of accepted life safety and building codes within all 50 us states means fewer
physical issues were identiﬁed however some operational management process deﬁciencies were
identiﬁed and are currently being addressed


now in the control phase the services operations audit project will include ongoing assessment onsite
spot checks and continued outreach site operations and facility management will be required to
complete an annual selfassessment and provide supporting documentation as evidence of ongoing
compliance in addition processes are in place to ensure that acquisitions are thoroughly evaluated to
ensure that new facilities meet appropriate standards


                                                                                                             82137

emergency preparedness
because emergencies and disasters often strike without warning xerox has implemented an emergency
preparedness and response program to help protect the safety of our employees the surrounding
communities and the environment


to prepare for emergencies xerox facilities worldwide have implemented sitespeciﬁc emergency
preparedness plans to assist with the development and execution of appropriate actions in response to
local emergencies our plans account for common emergencies such as responding to ﬁres for weather
related emergencies such as tornadoes and hurricanes and for more locationspeciﬁc emergencies such
as responding to earthquakes and radiological emergencies we also include resources and procedures
for ﬁrst aid medical response in the event of an injury or illness to an employee in our facilities in our
more complex and higher hazard operations we have medical emergency response teams merts
these mert employees are provided with training and the equipment necessary to respond quickly and
stabilize the medical emergency until more advanced medical support arrives


shelterinplace procedures already in place in our technology sites are being rolled out to our services
sites to protect our employees from emergency situations that occur outside of our facilities


in addition to emergency action plans that are established at the local operations level there are
preparedness plans at the corporate level including major incidents crisis management and pandemic
preparedness these plans have been designed with a central corporate strategy that utilizes an incident
command structure incident response managers are responsible for localregional tactical and
emergency response coordinating efforts at their respective locations with the corporate crisis
management team and addressing local business operations issues response coordination and
integration are part of the planning process


all preparedness plans are regularly tested for effectiveness through management reviews corporate
audits and annual drills any discrepancies are noted and corrective actions are implemented following
an emergency business resumption plans are put into action to ensure business operations are quickly
restored after an incident


motor vehicle safety
motor vehicle safety is a key component of our safety initiatives we have a company car program that
speciﬁes motor vehicle safety requirements for our drivers as well as accident prevention and reporting
processes employee driving records are reviewed on a regular basis and we provide remedial motor
vehicle safety training to improve awareness and competency motor vehicle accidents are tracked by
frequency and type and are reported to the management team


we also participate in ﬂeet safety benchmark forums to keep up to date on the latest motor vehicle
safety practices and technologies and to share xeroxs best practices with our peers


the use of cell phones in any company vehicle is restricted texting is forbidden while the vehicle is
moving employees who need to use their phones in the car are instructed to ﬁnd a safe place to stop


a comprehensive safety review is conducted on any vehicle model prior to it being accepted as part of
the xerox ﬂeet we review the safety ratings and crash test results of candidate vehicles and require
safety features such as daytime running lights and safety barriers between the drivers seat and storage
areas




                                                                                                              83137

ergonomics
because musculoskeletal disorders represent a signiﬁcant portion of our workrelated injuries we work to
minimize the risk factors as a job is designed we study exposure to ergonomic hazards and raise
awareness with employees so they can make improvements to their workstations


from manufacturing operations to ofﬁce work we continue to study the causes and potential remedies
for workplace injuries the following provides some brief highlights


     manufacturing operations workstation evaluations are conducted in xerox facilities worldwide for
     ergonomic hazards based upon risk proﬁle and injury experience ergonomic enhancements such as
     tilt tables lifts and hoists make it easier for employees to maneuver parts and equipment during
     assembly
     machine service xerox customer service engineers cses exposure to ergonomic hazards has
     been studied the ﬁndings have helped us select tools and develop procedures to mitigate risk of
     musculoskeletal disorders throughout the equipment design process evaluations are done to
     assess risks for our cses the best time to make a modiﬁcation is when a product is still in the
     design or early test phases
     ofﬁce ergonomics our largest employee population is ofﬁcebased raising awareness and helping
     employees make effective workstation changes is critical to minimizing risk for this population we
     created computerbased training on ergonomics principles and practices this method of delivery
     enables employees to go through needed training programs at a time that minimizes business
     interruptions for employees that require additional ergonomic technical assistance due to
     workplace injuries or medical accommodations we have partnered with a thirdparty consultant to
     conduct more detailed ergonomic assessments by leveraging this consultant we are able to better
     support a larger geographic area we also continue to focus on ways to unify the ergonomics
     program across all sectors of business


asset protection and fire safety
the xerox asset protection and fire safety program provides ﬁresafe workplaces and limits the
potential for losses to xerox equipment and property from ﬁre explosion and natural hazards such as
windstorms snowloading collapse and ﬂoods the program includes periodic inspections management
reviews of ﬁndings and mitigation planning our philosophy is to maintain our highervalued locations
at a highly protected risk standard in addition locations are reviewed for conformance to xerox
standards and recognized ﬁre and life safety standards we continue to demonstrate strong loss control
performance and beneﬁt from favorable insurance rates and premiums


contractor safety process
the goal of the contractor safety program is to ensure contracted work conforms to all applicable
regulations and xerox environmental health and safety requirements contractors are qualiﬁed to the
safety and health requirements prior to beginning work at a xerox location contractors are required to
submit a job safety plan and workers on us xerox sites attend an orientation session incidents and
injuries are tracked both as feedback and to measure program effectiveness although ﬁrst established
at our rochester new york operations this model has been applied successfully to many of our larger
locations


xerox also functions as a contractor for many xerox client accounts we have in place internal safety
standards and establish safety plans deliver speciﬁc employee training and maintain management
oversight to ensure operations meet both xerox and client requirements




                                                                                                            84137

workplace health management
our workplace health programs include processes for emergency medical response the characterization
of employee ﬁtness for duty illness prevention preemployment drug testing and health and wellness
promotion


programs are in place for conducting medical exams in connection with safetysensitive work and drug
testing and immunizations based upon speciﬁc work operations and client accounts ehss and
corporate risk management partner on managing accommodations and post injury or disability return
to work processes


preventing and monitoring workplace exposures
to protect employees from unsafe exposure to chemicals noise and radiation xerox applies exposure
limits to worldwide manufacturing research and technology service operations based upon the
threshold limit values tlv recommended by the american conference of governmental industrial
hygienists these reﬂect the best advice of a widely respected committee of international experts
however in jurisdictions where government regulations are more stringent xerox meets those regulatory
requirements for some materials  including toners and certain solvents and metals  xerox has
established exposure limits that are more stringent than the tlv or existing regulations and standards


using the xerox exposure assessment process industrial hygiene and safety professionals monitor
assess and report workplace exposures effective process design engineering controls safe job
procedures and personal protective equipment are used to control exposures and protect employee
health medical surveillance programs are in place to monitor the health of employees working in
operations with speciﬁc jobs and hazards eg high noise organic solvents results of those medical
exams are reviewed to ensure no adverse health effects


of the workplace exposures monitored in 2015 approximately 99 percent were within xerox limits all
were within regulatory limits or were controlled through the proper use of personal protective equipment
where engineering controls were not possible


environment health and safety project reviews
we continually make modiﬁcations to work processes and operations to improve efﬁciency and
effectiveness to ensure these changes meet xerox safety standards and follow our risk management
philosophy projects are reviewed by technical safety and environmental professionals the scope of the
project is deﬁned potential safety and environmental impacts are characterized and control
requirements are established before the project is initiated the process serves to inform the engineering
and management teams about safety requirements and ensures all project designs have controls
integrated into work plans the process ensures environmental health and safety requirements are
understood and implemented at the beginning of the project




                                                                                                             85137

more than twodozen technology platforms to drive our business these platforms support more than
100 customer offerings such as the merge parking platform mobile analytics platform citysight 
maven outbreak management software and the xerox program integrity validator today
approximately 40 percent of our patent ﬁlings are in support of our services offerings


customer dreaming sessions
in the words of sophie vandebroek xerox chief technology ofﬁcer and president of the xerox
innovation group something is only an innovation if it makes a difference to our clients or to the
world so the question is how do you know what delights your customers in our case we ask them


at xerox we view our customers as partners in innovation our researchers observe customers and their
clients directly in their work environments and employ ethnographic methods to identify needs and pain
points last year we conducted nearly 200 customer events with more than 2500 participants more
than half of those interactions were dreaming sessions where researchers and customers get together
to explore the future of the customers business and identify the key issues


from those deep dives spring ideas that develop into business opportunities for example were working
on ways to make it easier to harness data from images scientists and engineers from our four global
research centers are applying advanced image processing sophisticated algorithms and predictive

analytics to a range of industries including transportation and healthcare


the merge parking management system deployed in downtown los angeles is one example of a
solution built on xerox innovation this ﬁrstofitskind system gathers and analyzes data from smart
meters offstreet parking lots and more than 6000 onstreet parking sensors to provide a complete
picture of parking demand motorists use their smartphones and vehicle navigation systems to obtain
realtime information on parking rates and available parking spaces and to make payments in
addition smartpricing algorithms adjust parking rates based on demand this demandbased pricing
helps eliminate congestion by offering incentives to drivers to use a different mode of transportation or
park farther away


xerox is developing an easytouse transit solution called xerox seamless which will provide a new
disruptive model for public transport mobile payments operators would simply install near field
communication nfc tags provided by xerox on their transport network the tags use a patented
method developed by xerox research and development teams based in grenoble and valence france
to secure the encrypted transactions and transmit them even without network connectivity

chemicals and noise as a result current products have achieved chemical emission levels that are well
below global regulatory requirements  often at or near the detection limit of our measurement
equipment  and are considered to have a negligible impact on customers work environments we
publish emissions data on each products safety data sheet


toner study
in 2013 we concluded a comprehensive investigation that lasted more than three decades on the
health risks of inhaling xerographic toner the studies included assessments of the health of current
employees and an assessment of the causes of death for people who worked for the company between

cybersecurity
cyber attacks pose a threat to our customers our employees and our partners  in short our very
business thats why were always on the alert working to stop hackers who would deface our website
or gain access to sensitive information we have comprehensive plans to deal with sophisticated threats
such as organized cyber criminals cyberespionage groups and even statesponsored intrusion


our cybersecurity strategy has ﬁve major components


datacentric protection
we use data segregation encryption and datalossprevention technologies to ensure safe and secure
processing and sharing of critical information in addition all data is classiﬁed according to its
sensitivity this data classiﬁcation process enables us to understand the relative importance of securing
each dataset and to make an informed business decision about the level and allocation of resources
required


standardsbased management
by following industrystandard cybersecurity guidelines we ensure our processes are repeatable
predictable and easily understandable


of the numerous cybersecurity control frameworks we chose to implement both iso 27000 and the
national institute of standards  technology cybersecurity framework


     iso 27000 information security management system  this international standard deﬁnes
     requirements for establishing implementing maintaining and continually improving an
     information security management system we incorporate iso 27000 as a normal part of our
     business processes independent auditors have certiﬁed many of our systems and data centers as
     iso 27000compliant
     national institute of standards  technology cybersecurity framework  created through
     collaboration between industry and government this framework protects networks and
     infrastructure the prioritized ﬂexible and scalable approach helps us manage cybersecurityrelated
     risk in a costeffective manner while this framework is relatively new to xerox it has already
     proven useful to predict detect disrupt or deter respond and recover valuable data

capability maturity assessments performed by independent parties and benchmarking with other
companies ﬁnd our implementation to be sound relevant and aligned with industry standards


continuous assessment
we utilize a combination of evidencebased assessments vulnerability scanning and penetration tests to
validate that our data protection is effective and to ensure controls are operating properly on an
ongoing basis


cybersecurity incident response
we have emergency response procedures in place throughout our business if we were to identify an
attempted cybersecurity attack we would take the following actions


     identify whom to notify internally

                                                                                                            95137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report

     establish a multidiscipline virtual response team
     implement monitoring protocols and egress prevention
     estimate the extent of the compromise
     coordinate with legal counsel and insurance carriers
     if necessary notify legal authorities

these steps provide a general framework business units have detailed plans tailored to their needs we
perform tests to assess our operational and managerial readiness on a regular basis


cyber risk management
recent highproﬁle breaches in the media demonstrate that any organization can suffer a cyber attack
when this occurs there may be costly consequences  such as regulatory ﬁnes or purchasing identity
theft monitoring for affected parties many companies invest in errors  omissions or cyber liability
insurance to mitigate this risk


many insurance carriers and underwriters assess the level of risk when determining insurance rates
xerox as well as other companies has received reduced premiums andor more favorable policy limits by
implementing effective cybersecurity management


cybersecurity is not solely the responsibility of the it department by collaborating across our company
we effectively manage risk reduce the likelihood and limit the impact of exposure and enable quick
recovery from any attack on our infrastructure networks and systems




                                                                                                            96137

union and the far east learn more about our efforts to meet section 508 accessibility requirements


today we are focused on increased mobility with the anywhere alwayson enterprise were enabling
enterprises to manage a complex infrastructure as employees are bringing their own devices to work
and demanding the same seamless secure ability to ﬁnd use and print business documents xerox

anticorruption
xerox operates an active and comprehensive antibribery and anticorruption program that complies
with all related laws and regulations we have developed a global compliance program supported by
policy and training to ensure zero tolerance for the giving or offering of a bribe of any amount or value
including socalled facilitation payments the program also includes risk assessment of thirdparty
intermediaries followed by the application of appropriate due diligence training and certiﬁcation prior
to engagement we are committed to enhancing the program continually


banknote anticounterfeiting
the risk of banknote counterfeiting has increased with the quality of digital imaging tools and color
printing technology in response we have joined other companies the us secret service and the
central bank counterfeit deterrence group a consortium of 32 central banks and note printing
authorities to assess threats to currency and support the use of anticounterfeiting technologies
technology to deter the use of digital equipment for counterfeiting banknotes is being standardized
xerox sales and service employees are trained to respond to inquiries about our anticounterfeiting
efforts


black market supplies
every year the global imaging industry  and the customers who use its products and services  suffer
the loss of millions of dollars due to counterfeiting or theft of supplies we continually remind our
customers that counterfeit supplies can result in poor equipment performance low supply yields inferior
print quality toner leakage increased failure rates and equipment downtime  all of which can cost
time and money to avoid this risk we advise our customers to purchase solely from xerox authorized
resellers we work closely with our procurement department to call attention to blending of supplies
 the mixing of counterfeit with original materials to achieve lower pricing and make detection of
counterfeit items more difﬁcult


theft of customer supplies represents an increasingly costly problem for xerox and its customers it is
difﬁcult to prevent because webbased sales channels make it easy to purchase stolen products and to
sell them once they are stolen we continue to invest in technology and resources to bring the problem
to the attention of customers and to identify their obligation to maintain the security of supplies
contracted and purchases through engagement and support of our customers and local law
enforcement agencies we also provide tracing of stolen goods to identify and close the sources of theft


                                                                                                              103137

our senior managers play a leadership role in various organizations such as the business roundtable
and the us chamber of commerce these organizations develop and promote public policies that are
considered important to our public policy interests and operations


while we prefer to make political expenditures directly rather than through professional organizations
and associations xerox like all major corporations is a member of various 501c organizations that
may engage in political activities while we may not necessarily agree with every position taken by each
organization to which we contribute we determine that the intended use of a contribution is consistent
with our mission and core values before making a contribution to any such group we inquire and make
a reasonable effort to obtain from those associations the portion of the dues or payments that are used
for lobbying expenditures or political contributions to the extent it is reported to us we disclose the
nondeductible portion of our contributions annually

  percent the reductions are the result of improved energy efﬁciency new technologies
  and improved energy management practices

   note the 2012 baseline has been restated in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol
  inventory adjustments are completed each year as a result of the opening and closing of
  facilities and the use of more appropriate emission factors to make data and performance trends
  between years more comparable
