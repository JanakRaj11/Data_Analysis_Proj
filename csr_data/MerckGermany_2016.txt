despite our efforts at accident prevention weve had four fatal workplace accidents over the last two years in
2015 one employee died in a car accident in the usa and in germany one employee suffered a fatal accident
involving a fork lift in 2014 an employee died in venezuela in a traffic accident and in pakistan an employee
suffered a fatal incident doing maintenance work on a scissor lift


both merck employees as well as contractors have been included in the calculation of these indicators


through the ltir we record workrelated accidents that involve at least one day of missed work a work
related accident is an injury that results from the type of work in the course of doing said work and that has
no internal cause cumulative trauma workrelated accidents are considered relevant if they occur on the
premises on business trips during goods transport as a result of external influences eg natural disasters
or due to criminal acts involving personal injury commuting accidents and accidents during company sporting
activities are not included firstaid incidents are generally not included in the ltir since these usually do not
result in more than one day of missed work


by 2020 we intend to sustainably lower the ltir to 15 the aim is to permanently stabilize or outperform
this challenging number which we achieved for the first time in 2015


for the merck kgaa sites in darmstadt and gernsheim about 19 of the employees of the merck group we
only report workrelated illnesses if these have been diagnosed and verified by a physician in the reporting
period no cases of workinduced illness were recorded


we have defined the ltir as a key indicator for the merck group therefore we do not publish any other
indicators such as workplace accidents lost days or days of absence the ltir is not broken down by gender
as this differentiation is not relevant to our strategic planning

regular feedback and employee performance evaluations are essential to a systematic development process
our globally uniform performance and talent management process requires annual feedback meetings and
performance assessments for all employees rated global grade 10 and up in our position grading system
apart from evaluating employee performance this helps us to identify individual development opportunities
the performance and talent management process is coordinated via the hr suite it system


when it comes to applying this process our individual subsidiaries can decide for themselves whether to
include employees rated below global grade 10 in germany all permanent employees have been
participating in the performance and talent management process since 2013 in 2015 around
36017 employees worldwide were involved in the process

  have been calculated based on the current corporate structure of the reporting year and retroactively adjusted for
  acquisitions eg az group in 2014 or divestments of parts of companies or for changes in emission factors portfolio
  adjusted

the increase in biogenic carbon emissions was caused by the biomass powerplants that were commissioned in
goa india and jaffrey new hampshire usa at the end of 2014


our response to the carbon disclosure project contains a detailed description of our calculation methods we
have included the following gases in our calculation of direct and indirect co 2eq emissions

in shipping finished goods from our production sites to the local warehouses of our subsidiaries we have been
working to reduce the use of air shipping in favor of sea freight this change aims to both reduce costs as well
as lower transportrelated co2 emissions

renewable energies account for a higher share of electricity generation at production sites in switzerland with
nuclear energy taking the lead in france based on an estimated global energy efficiency of 37 for the
conversion and distribution of generated electricity this results in a primary energy consumption of 1260
gwh for 2015 based on an estimated global energy efficiency of 85 for heatsteamcold this results in a
primary energy consumption of 98 gwh for 2015 this yields a total primary energy consumption of 1358
gwh for 2015 the calculation is based on factors stated in the handbuch für betriebliches
energiemanagement  systematisch energiekosten senken manual for energy management in practice 
systematically reducing energy costs published by dena 122012

the amount of nonhazardous waste disposed decreased in 2015 because there was less landfill needing
disposal


the increase in nonhazardous waste recycled can be attributed to the sharp rise in landfill construction
waste and demolition waste landfill construction waste and demolition waste accounted for 47 of total
waste in 2014 and 53 of total waste in 2015

in 2015 the significant increase in spending on the erbitux  china patient assistance program which falls

to make improvements within the community are classified as community investment


initiatives that are predominantly aimed at companyrelevant factors such as image or personnel recruitment
are classified as commercial initiatives in the community charitable activities covers any other projects
that benefit a charitable organization but cannot be listed under either of the other two motivation categories
due to missing data or their narrow scope
