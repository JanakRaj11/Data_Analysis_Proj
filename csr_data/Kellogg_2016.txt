                 responsible sourcing
we believe that responsible sourcing is good for people good for our company good
for the environment and good for the local economies where our ingredients are grown
as leaders in this area kellogg is committed to responsibly sourcing the ingredients
that go into our foods to enhance the sustainability of the ingredients themselves and
to improve the livelihoods of farmers including smallholders and women

for example kellogg has been committed to the                pledge to ensure the traceability of our palm oil supplies
responsible sourcing of palm oil since 2009 and we have      to mills and plantations with action plans to close any
taken numerous steps since that time to ensure that our       gaps by the end of 2015 we are proud of our progress
palm oil supplies are environmentally appropriate socially   having achieved 92 percent traceability to mills and
beneficial and economically viable in 2015 we published     we continue to work with our suppliers to build action
an updated responsible palm oil policy that included a        plans to achieve plantationlevel traceability
