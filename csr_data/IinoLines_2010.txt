fiscal 2009 earnings                                             based on our current mediumterm management plan we

a decline in seaborne trade and an increase in newbuild          strategic priority and to ensure a stable operational
supply along with yen appreciation and rising fuel prices      foundation over the medium to long term we pushed

question 1                                                       reconstruction with completion scheduled for the end of

                                                                 there is actually a reason we combine shipping with real
the iino groups core businesses are shipping and
                                                                 estate operations in shipping our bottom line is impacted
real estate what makes these businesses unique                 by fluctuations in various macroeconomic factors such as
                                                                 freight rates foreign exchange rates bunker fuel oil prices

answer 1
                                                                 and interest rates in contrast rents in the real estate
                                                                 market fluctuate slowly over the medium to long term rents
                                                                 are relatively stable rarely swinging wildly over short
at the end of march 31 2010 95 of the 116 ships
                                                                 periods
operated by the iino group were tankers that transport
                                                                 so by combining shipping which has growth potential but
liquids the iino group also transports natural gas
                                                                 also many variable factors with real estate which
propane butane and other gases which are actually
                                                                 generates stable revenues we are able to secure stable
transported in liquid form by tankers
                                                                 earnings for the iino group as a whole
one way in which our shipping business is unique is that
its fleet primarily consists of tankers a large percentage of
which are chemical tankers
chemical tankers transport more than just chemical
                                                                 question 2
products they can transport almost anything as long as it       in fiscal 2009 both revenues and profits declined
is liquid at ordinary temperatures so they transport oils      significantly from the previous fiscal year what is
such as palm oil and lubricants and cargoes like sulfuric
                                                                 your outlook for fiscal 2010 also what sort of
acid which melts ship tanks at low concentrations
in addition to tankers we have bulk carriers which             progress are you making toward meeting your
transport such cargo as soybeans and other grains               mediumterm management plans targets
fertilizers steel coal for power generation and woodchips
for paper manufacturing all of these cargoes are referred
to as dry bulk meaning they can be put into a ships hold
unpackaged
                                                                 answer 2
so another unique feature of the iino groups shipping           the decline in both revenues and profits in fiscal 2009 was
business is that it transports a wide variety of cargo          largely due to the drop in freight rates due to the global
in the real estate business we focus primarily on leasing       economic slump triggered by lehman brothers collapse
office space all of our buildings are located in central        we were particularly affected by the decline in dry bulk
tokyo we have five buildings currently in operation            freight rates the drop in freight rates in the chemical
excluding the iino building which is under                      tanker division and the decline in transport volume

we were also negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign                                earnings are based on fiscal 2009 profits and take into
exchange rates and bunker fuel oil prices                                                 account changes in foreign exchange rates and bunker
nonetheless we remained profitable by countering the                                      fuel oil prices in the real estate business we expect

question 3                                                       question 4
you regard safety as a key management priority what             in recent years companies have faced pressure from
is your specific approach to securing safety and what            society to address environmental issues what are
are you doing in that regard                                    your thoughts about protecting the environment and
                                                                 what actions are you taking

answer 3
during normal times people pay little attention to
                                                                 answer 4
safety japan is one of the safer countries in the world        business activities invariably impact the environment in
so japanese people tend view safety as a given                  some way and the iino group is no exception
but a momentary lapse in safety can have enormous                the operation of ships by our shipping business consumes
repercussions in the shipping business accidents               vast amounts of fossil fuel emitting co 2 sox and nox
may not only damage cargoes and ships but destroy                into the atmosphere causing global warming and air
the environment and peoples lives which are                    pollution an oil spill if one were to occur would pollute the
irreplaceable the same is true in the real estate business     ocean also it has been pointed out that ballast water
problems with electricity gas and infrastructure such as      which is used to stabilize ships adversely impacts
internet connections can impact tenants immensely there        biodiversity for details refer to pages 1316 of this
is also no guarantee that accidents and other                    report
contingencies will not occur at the iino groups rental office   in the real estate business the iino groups leased office
buildings which are located in central tokyo and in which       buildings consume considerable electricity for lighting air
many people congregate                                          conditioning and so on offices also use reams of paper
therefore we must remain constantly aware of safety and         and generate waste
actively work to ensure it accordingly our management          as a member of society we have a responsibility to reduce
principles state first and foremost that securing safety        our environmental impact by as much as possible this is
is the foundation of our business operations and               not a singular objective however it must be balanced
we work to instill safety awareness in our employees and         against operational efficiency and the quality of services
everyone else associated with the iino group                    provided to customers we remain mindful of these issues
we also have organizational frameworks in place                 while engaging in a range of initiatives at the iino group
as detailed later in this report we maintain a safety and       in the shipping business for example we have installed
environmental committee which meets regularly to discuss        equipment to reduce bunker fuel consumption and are
issues related to safety and the environment and we have        working to eradicate oil spills we hope to help prevent air
separate risk management frameworks for normal times             pollution ocean pollution and global warming through
and emergencies                                                 these efforts in the real estate business we are reducing
we also set detailed safetyrelated targets and strive to        energy consumption by installing energysaving equipment
improve every year in the shipping business for example       and carefully turning off lights in common areas and we
we set numerical targets with respect to preventing              use environmentally friendly building materials the iino
collisions and equipment failures and annually draw up           building scheduled for completion at the end of june
specific action plans to achieve them in the real estate        2011 incorporates various environmental design features
business also we set safetyrelated targets and continue to     we set annual numerical targets for our environmental
take action every year toward achieving them for details      measures as we do for safety we believe that taking
refer to pages 3536 and page 39 of this report                specific action toward achieving targets steadily yields
the entire group works together every year to achieve            results year after year
greater levels of safety through these efforts

question 5                                                    we also transport various other cargoes that directly and
                                                              indirectly affect peoples lives such as woodchips for

but you are involved with society and individuals both        few people know this but a sizeable share of cargo traded
directly and indirectly what are some specific               internationally is transported by ship a total of 973 million
examples of this also what kind of company do you           tons of cargo was traded between japan and other
                                                              countries in 2008 and of that 997 by weight was
want to be viewed as by society
                                                              transported by ship japan depends largely on other
                                                              countries for supplies of natural resources and food so

answer 5                                                      marine shipping plays an extremely important role
                                                              we will continue to reliably fulfill our role as a supporting
                                                              pillar of the japanese economy and society through both
first the iino groups real estate business is deeply        shipping and real estate
connected with society and individuals by leasing offices
we provide people who work in them with comfortable
places to do business and iino hall in the old iino
building hosted many events including classical music
concerts and traditional arts performances the iino hall
will be back with a new look in the new iino building we
plan to add a conference center for meetings so we hope
that even more people visit and spend some productively
creative time at the iino building
our shipping business is actually deeply connected with
society also the petroleum liquefied gas coal and other
natural resources that the iino group transports are
essential to modern lifestyles and economic
activity transporting petrochemical
products is the iino groups forte of those
products ethylene glycol meg for
instance is used to make pet bottles

special feature 1




designing a building admired
for the next century and beyond
the iino group is currently rebuilding the iino building in tokyos uchisaiwaicho with completion scheduled for the end of
june 2011 the new building will be a largescale structure with 27 aboveground and 4 basement floors housing offices a
commercial zone and a multipurpose hall the new building will replace the old iino building completed in 1960 iino group
employees involved in the rebuilding project have shared a common aspiration that of creating a new building that will be as
admired as the old iino building for the next century and beyond this section looks at the subject of those aspirations the
new iino building

                 an urban oasis linked to hibiya park
connecting people in the heart of tokyo

uchisaiwaicho where the iino building stands is an important
district of central tokyo near publicsector offices in adjacent
kasumigaseki and major office districts in adjacent marunouchi
and otemachi the old iino building thrived together with the
uchisaiwaicho district for nearly half a century until being
closed in 2008 we hope to enjoy the ongoing admiration of
people and the community at large to achieve that goal the
iino group focused on connections as the rebuilding projects
fundamental design theme
the iino building is located near five train stations making it
accessible via twelve railway lines harnessing this
convenience will make it possible to connect people with each
other we are also carrying on the old iino buildings legacy of
connections with the community through this approach we
aim to build good relationships with people and the community

connecting people and nature with
greenery

people today place more importance on harmony with
nature than in times past in planning the new building
we devised ways of connecting people and nature the
site faces hibiya park across kokkaidori street our
design integrates the building site with the park and its
many trees visitors approaching the building entrance
from the park will encounter iino forest a garden with
several dozen planted trees a verdant oasis in the heart
of the capital the building exterior will be clad in
rockville white american granite a white granite with
black graining that imparts warmth and a pristine look
beyond the forest visitors arrive at the expansive
entrance lobby enveloped in white marble the lobby
connects to the offices iino hall and commercial
facilities
the interior also will convey a natural feel iino hall on
the fourth floor will feature a large entrance foyer as well
as a foyer and rooftop garden terrace facing hibiya
park from the rooftop garden people will have close
views of the park and iino forest and feel as though
they are enveloped by nature lush greenery will imbue
the local surrounds with a relaxed tranquil atmosphere
and serve as an emergency response base in the event
of a disaster

people think of this problem as the need to value animal life   hardshell clams which are used in clam chowder are
and to save pandas and other endangered species these          rising which is driving away native species conversely
are noble efforts but only one part of the problem for         reports indicate that highly reproductive wakame

shellfish from which humans benefit are all                   competing out local seaweeds ballast water is the likely
interconnected protecting animals is not the only thing we    cause of these problems we must prevent and reduce the
need to take a comprehensive view of and approach to            damage done by inflows of nonnative species as much as
connections between organisms and the value that those          possible
connection provide
at cop 10 we plan to discuss ways of protecting
biodiversity of coastlines oceans and inland rivers in
japan the debate about protecting biodiversity has not
progressed as far as in european countries and interest in
protecting marine ecosystems is lower than for landbased
ecosystems shipping companies coexist with the ocean
so they must be proactive in protecting oceanic
biodiversity
hisasue mr kimura at a time when little was being done to
protect biodiversity you pioneered an npo to protect the
oceans many people have expressed support for these
efforts having formerly run a marine survey company you                                   rapana venosa sea snail eggs

kohsaka mr kimura is very realistic it is almost impossible   rules on ballast water the us requires all ships to
to fix ecosystems once they have been destroyed getting         exchange ballast water 200 nautical miles offshore north
rid of nonnative species is extremely costly and               pacific seas are rough in winter which makes exchanging
unexpected consequences often emerge when we meddle              ballast water extremely dangerous when exchanging
with natural organisms so an effective means of                 ballast water the center of gravity shifts and we risk
safeguarding biodiversity while protecting ecosystems is         damage to the ship from the force of water banging around
for shipping companies to tackle the ballast water problem       in the tank in australia port expansions have not kept
as part of their normal operations                              pace with increased shipping traffic stemming from the
                                                                 resources boom ships sometimes only have around 15
the iino groups ballast water initiatives                       hours to load cargo upon entering port ballast water must
                                                                 be discharged while cargo is loaded this is very labor
hisasue mr yamahiro is a former ship captain and now in        intensive countries are generally tightening rules at
charge of vessel operations for the iino groups ships most     present so we are studying and responding to
people are unfamiliar with the ballast water problem could      developments in that regard
you explain it                                                  hisasue iino lines will of course comply with each
yamahiro ships have always needed to adjust their center        countrys rules is that right
of gravity and screw submergence depth because cargo is          yamahiro we are working voluntarily to not only comply
always being loaded and unloaded in the 19th century all       with laws but to protect the oceans we actively attach
ships began using ballast water to keep their screws             purifiers to our ships however we face a difficult problem
submerged around 30 years ago oil tankers out of japan         in terms of operations ships have a life of about 20 years
bound for oil producing countries would take seawater into       but once built they are difficult to retrofit we are also
their oil tanks and separate the oil from the seawater upon      constantly subject to shipping rate competition moreover
discharge dumping the seawater into the ocean but              we cannot tell which world ports our groups ships will be
ocean pollution became a problem so these days all ships        heading for so we have to comply with the most stringent
have tanks exclusively for ballast water however               rules but we dont know what form rules will take we
organisms carried in ballast water may be destroying             currently have a keen eye on purification equipment
marine ecosystems to address this issue the imo                development and directions taken by the ballast water
international maritime organization has added rules            management convention
concerning ballast water with countries beginning to ratify
the ballast water management convention iino lines is           the need for strong ties between
preparing for tougher regulations refer to sidebar on           shipping companies and society
page 16
hisasue what problems does that raise                          kohsaka countries worldwide are working to create a set
yamahiro there are two problems the first relates to           of unified rules for biodiversity problems in place of
preparing for the convention rules as a group we have          disparate regulations and calls are increasing for the
studied methods of purifying ballast water to comply with        creation of globally unified rules for ballast water so rules
the rules one way of doing this is to use chemicals to          are likely to become tougher an early response seems
purge anything living in the water but this has the potential   crucial
to pollute the ocean so you need to use equipment to            kimura ballast water regulations are designed to protect
purify ballast water but we havent found a satisfactory        ecosystems so we welcome them is there a way for you to

take advantage of these regulations rather than viewing                             growth of nonnative species we would like you to not only
them negatively                                                                    work on the ballast water problem but also cooperate with
yamahiro japanese land is rich in water resources the                             stakeholders on a variety of initiatives
idea of transporting drinking water to the middle east in                           kimura our npo has teamed up with companies to clean
ballast tanks has been discussed in the shipping industry                          coastal areas and carry out other projects but i dont think
another idea was to use ballast tanks as aquariums to                               weve done much work with shipping companies so far we
transport japanese fish overseas but the difficulty of                             both benefit from the ocean so we should be able to
maintaining a hygienic environment within ballast tanks                             collaborate in a variety of ways ecosystem destruction in
makes such ideas impractical finding a solution to the                             tokyo bay and japanese seas is the result of multiple
ballast water issue is likely to take some time                                    problems with shipping activity being one of the causes at
hisasue going forward we hope to strengthen ties with                             the same time shipping is a worthwhile enterprise that
societal stakeholders and contribute to society and solve                           underpins modern life together we should consider ways
problems through our core operations including with                                of sustaining both shipping industry development and
respect to the ballast water problem we want to hear from                          environmental protection and foster new joint initiatives
academics and ngos about what they think iino lines can                             shipping companies networks connect japan with other
do                                                                                 countries and different regions of japan via sea so it
kohsaka i think that the workings of shipping companies                           would be quite productive if you could provide
daytoday operations are fairly opaque to the general                              opportunities for people to connect and for the exchange of
public unlike upstream producers and downstream                                    ideas with npos and researchers
retailers who deal directly with consumers shipping is a                           hisasue the shipping industry and iino lines should
midstream industry it nevertheless plays an important role                         deepen societal ties and think more deeply about the
and impacts society through ballast water for example id                         benefits provided by the ocean we will give serious
like to see shipping companies disseminating information                           consideration to your views as we work to protect the
listening to public opinion and strengthening ties with                            oceanic environment

message from the former president



the iino group has always viewed safety as an               continue to work as one to meet your expectations and
important management issue to us the word safety        we look forward to your continued support
implies two ideals
one is the desire to avoid ever being the cause of a        in conclusion i would like to express my gratitude to
major accident for example if crude oil carried by our    everyone from outside the iino group who contributed
oil tankers or hazardous materials transported by our       to this report and to all of its readers
chemical tankers were to leak into the ocean it would
dramatically impact the natural environment
the second is the desire to avoid being caught up in
dangerous situations the iino groups vessels still risk
encountering piracy on the waters they travel
moreover some of our vessels may encounter
unavoidable situations even if the most careful
precautions are taken they could be nudged or worse
by another vessel while anchored for example we
must always exercise caution and never forget to
prepare for danger nevertheless some situations are
unpredictable and unavoidable even with such
precautions i pray that our entire fleet never
encounters such situations and always enjoys safe
voyages
looking back my life in the shipping business began
with a small company immediately after the
consolidation of japans shipping industry and i grew
in step with the companys subsequent growth in
retrospect shipping industry consolidation also brought
home the importance of standing on your own two feet
and widespread concern for safety which combined to
give rise to a corporate culture that values longterm
stability and independence perhaps this background is
why iino has long been regarded as having sound
management
our culture is also manifest in our unique corporate
strategy comprising a tenacious investment strategy
focused on longterm results and investment in the real
estate business as a source of stable earnings one
pertinent example is our chemical tanker division
which was launched in 1979 and is currently one of our
mainstay areas after more than twenty difficult years
the division finally began yielding tangible earnings
upon the turn of the millennium this kind of
entrepreneurial spirit within the company has been
handed down through the years culminating in the iino
                                                                                 executive adviser
group as it exists today looking ahead we hope to
                                                                                 former president
continue to provide services that are safe reliable and
                                                                                 katsuyuki sugimoto
convenient and create new value
in my role as executive adviser i will support the new
company president and work to ensure the iino groups
continued advancement the entire iino group will
