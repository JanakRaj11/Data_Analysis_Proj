sponda recognises this and pays particular attention to the energy efficiency of its properties and the carbon footprint
caused by energy consumption


the key aspects of the priority are

   the consumption of heat electricity and water in buildings
   property development
   increasing environmental awareness among clients and employees


why is this a priority

the european union has made a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020 the eu has a
further target of reducing emissions by 8095 per cent by 2050 in 2021 all new buildings must meet near zero energy standards


improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing emissions therefore plays a key role in achieving these aims sponda strives to reach
the eu targets through its own operations and through cooperation with clients energy efficiency is an important consideration in all of the
companys property development projects as well as renovation and maintenance operations


every day approximately 30000 people work in premises owned by sponda as tenant activity causes up to 60 per cent of the total energy
consumption of a building cooperation between the landlord and tenant is of crucial importance in reducing energy consumption sponda
encourages its clients to be energy efficient and to take environmental aspects into consideration in the use of properties the company also
provides guidance to its clients on energy efficiency and environmentally friendly building use


for spondas properties located in finland environmental monitoring includes the collection of information on energy and water consumption as
well as waste management volumes1 for office properties in russia the consumption of electricity and water are monitored there is a certain
degree of annual variability in spondas property holdings due to sales and purchases which affects the comparability of the annual environment
figures


environmentally responsible property development

at sponda new construction property renovation and the design of lowenergy office buildings are all subject to the companys design
guidelines which in many ways are more extensive than generally applied standards and regulations the design guidelines are reviewed and
updated annually they help the company develop adaptable and energy efficient properties that offer functional working environments


sponda pays particular attention to environmental requirements in its property development operations sponda applies for international
environmental classification an environmental certificate for all new buildings and major renovation projects


spondas energy efficiency programme is aimed at conserving energy

the energy efficient use of properties is supported particularly through spondas energy efficiency programme which is aimed at achieving
energy savings in cooperation with clients the properties included in the programme carry out an energy review to determine the energy
consumption of each property and to examine the technical systems relating to energy consumption based on these reviews adjustments and
repairs are made at the properties in line with their use requirements




                                                                                                                                                 11

                                                                                                            corporate responsibility report 2013

energysaving goals and measures for achieving them are set individually for each property in cooperation with the users developments are
then monitored in regular meetings with clients spondas partners ovenia oy and corbel oy are responsible for property maintenance
operations and for collecting and monitoring energy consumption data


the cost savings achieved through the energy efficiency programme are reinvested in the property the programme initially aims at energy
savings of 10 per cent by 2016 the longterm goal is to achieve a 20 per cent saving in energy consumption by 2020 spondas progress with
respect to the programme and its targets has thus far been on schedule


environmental information for employees

the environmental expertise of employees is improved with the help of wwfs green office programme environmental awareness is increased
through an annual green day event internal training events as well as green office tips published regularly on the company intranet and
spondas facebook page


spondas employees are encouraged to make ecological choices through a company car policy that supports lowemission options employees
are also provided with company bicycles as part of spondas green office environmental programme employees are also trained in economical
driving


1 energy consumption monitoring extends to all properties for which sponda is responsible for energy purchasing this applies to 85 per cent of all properties cooling is

monitored separately for those properties that use district cooling if cooling is performed locally by compressors it is included in electricity consumption




objectives and measures
objectives for 2013

the environmental load of spondas properties in finland

   the comparable consumption of electricity heating cooling and water will decline in properties in finland
   developing a metrics strategy in 2013
   renewable energy sources research project and implementation of an application in 2013
   the consumption figures of spondas head office electricity heating district cooling and water will be reduced


the energy consumption of spondas properties in russia

   energy consumption will decrease in three office properties in russia


the environmental classification of buildings

   environmental certification for one newly constructed building
   certification work will continue and preliminary analyses will be conducted for new projects



measures taken in 2013

new properties covered by spondas energy efficiency programme

at the end of 2013 spondas energy efficiency programme covered 109 2012 107 properties five properties divested during the year were
omitted from spondas energy efficiency programme a total of 24 real estate funds properties managed by sponda joined in their own energy
efficiency programme in 2013 and at the end of the year the programme covered 34 properties in total




                                                                                                                                                                              12

the properties covered by spondas energy efficiency programme continued to carry out reviews implement energy saving measures and
monitor consumption in accordance with propertyspecific action plans


in 2013 a metrics strategy was developed for spondas properties to support the monitoring of consumption the company aims to apply the
metrics specified by the strategy to its new construction projects and significant renovation projects


in 2013 sponda carried out the renewable energy sources research project with the aim of using geothermal heat exclusively for the energy
generation at one sponda property the plan is to start the demo project in 2014


energy consumption of spondas properties decreased

the energy consumption of the finnish properties owned by sponda decreased in 2013 by 26 per cent the measured heating energy
consumption of comparable properties was down by 79 per cent from the previous year however weatheradjusted heating energy
consumption was 22 per cent lower than the year before the total electricity consumption of comparable properties decreased by 34 per cent
water consumption declined by 47 per cent and cooling energy consumption increased by 171 per cent compared to the year 2012


in 2013 the carbon footprint caused by the total energy consumption of all of spondas properties in finland was 55 per cent lower than in the
previous year


sponda aims to reduce the energy consumption of its properties also in russia in 2013 the electricity consumption of spondas office properties
in russia decreased by 36 per cent and heating consumption decreased by 98 per cent from the year 2014 sponda monitors electricity and
water consumption of its office properties in russia


sponda also aims to actively reduce the energy consumption and other environmental loads of its head office in helsinki in 2013 head offices
electricity consumption increased by 08 per cent standardised heating consumption declined by 32 per cent and district cooling increased by
84 per cent the water consumption of the head office decreased by 198 per cent compared to the year 2011 the year 2012 water
consumption figure of the property is not comparable


sponda signed its first green lease agreement

sponda and nordea banks branch at kaivokatu 12 in helsinki signed a green lease agreement in 2013 under the new lease model sponda
agrees with the client on joint objectives and a compensation model to encourage the use of environmentally friendly solutions and the reduction
of energy consumption at the premises used by nordeas branch a further goal is to reduce the amount of waste generated at the property and
to increase the recovery rate of waste to 90 per cent


sponda encourages its customers to conserve energy also in its environmental partnership programme which aims to reduce the environmental
load caused by the use of buildings through joint efforts at the end of 2013 sponda had 20 environmental partnership agreements 15 at the
end of 2012 the number of agreements was thus increased in line with the objectives in 2013


the extranet service for customers provides guidance on energy efficient operations and waste sorting and also includes news on the progress
of the energy efficiency programme customers can also use the service to monitor the energy consumption of their property on a monthly basis


leed certification granted to the ruoholahden ankkuri office building

sponda obtained leed gold environmental certification for its ruoholahden ankkuri office building which was completed in spring 2013 the
building received an especially good score for its efficient use of energy talentum plc is the main tenant of the office building located at

     green lease
        the new green lease model involves
         sponda and the customer agreeing on
         joint objectives and a compensation
         model to encourage the use of
         environmentally friendly solutions and the
         reduction of energy consumption

        the objectives can include for example
         reducing the buildings energy
         consumption water consumption and
         waste volume as well as increasing the
         waste recovery rate

        under the green lease agreement
         savings and excesses in energy costs
         for instance are divided annually
         between the tenant and the landlord

        the ecoefficiency requirements written
         into the lease also provide guidelines for
         changes and investments in the
         premises




material efficiency
sponda aims to facilitate convenient sorting of waste at its properties and provide instructions on recycling to the users of
properties material efficiency is also pursued by reducing the amount of waste generated in construction and renovation
work


the key aspects of the priority are

   the sorting and recovery of property waste
   improving efficiency in material use also in purchasing
   producing services with fewer material inputs and lower environmental effects



why is this a priority

the finnish waste act which was amended in 2012 is aimed at reducing waste generation improving material efficiency and increasing waste
recovery the national waste plan sets an objective of recycling 50 per cent by weight of municipal waste by 2016 a further target is to reuse or
recycle at least 70 per cent of all construction and demolition waste by 2020 sponda complies with the waste act in the waste management of
its properties and aims to contribute to the overall effort to reach the goals of the national waste plan through its own operations in addition
spondas target is to increase the waste recovery rate at its properties



effective waste management and reducing the volume of waste

while the appropriate sorting of waste is the responsibility of the users of properties sponda aims to facilitate convenient sorting of waste at its
properties through its own operations and by ensuring that the necessary waste sorting facilities are in place the company is responsible for
postsorting waste management unless otherwise agreed with tenants sponda encourages and guides the users of properties to recycle and
sort waste and to reduce the total volume of waste sponda facilitates waste handling by ensuring that waste management rooms are set up as
effectively as possible


reducing the volume of waste generation is an integral aspect of material efficiency spondas construction and renovation projects take this
aspect into account by investing in flexible and adaptable spatial solutions in building design this reduces construction wastegenerating
alteration work during the use of the building




                                                                                                                                                    16

                                                                                        corporate responsibility report 2013

in the construction phase of new buildings and major renovation projects the company has adopted onsite waste management guidelines
according to the international leed and breeam certification systems in all construction and renovation projects and the daytoday
maintenance of the companys properties the aim is to minimise the volume of waste ending up at landfill sites




objectives and measures
objectives for 2013

   the waste recovery rate at spondas properties in finland will increase to  86
   more environmental partnerships will be formed and action plans will be actively implemented
   the volume of office waste at spondas head office will be reduced



measures taken in 2013

sponda has continued to improve waste recycling at its properties within the framework of its cooperation agreement with lassila  tikanoja
due to the cooperation the waste recovery rate at properties owned by sponda in finland exceeded 87 per cent at the end of the year 2013
2012 average 82 per cent spondas total waste volume in 2013 was 6796 tonnes 2012 5898 tonnes of which 955 tonnes 2012 1059
tonnes was mixed waste the volume of mixed waste will be further reduced by improving waste sorting



environmental partnership strengthens cooperation

in order to increase environmental awareness among its customers and strengthen its customer cooperation sponda has established an
environmental partnership programme with 20 customers the aim of these partnerships is to increase the energy efficiency of premises and the
waste recovery rate as well as to pay attention to the environmental effects of customers operations the content and objectives of the
cooperation are always agreed upon with the customer


in 2013 sponda signed five new environmental partnership agreements with its customers the aim is to increase the number of partners further
in 2014


wwf finland has been one of spondas key partners in promoting environmental responsibility since 2010 the aim of the cooperation is to
pursue environmentally friendly practices in spondas operations and promote environmental responsibility among the companys customers and
the entire real estate industry


spondas head office was granted a threeyear extension of its wwf green office certification in 2013 in recognition of the high extent to which
environmental aspects are taken into consideration in office work as a wwf partner sponda also encourages its customers to join the green
office network sponda supports its customers green office processes by helping their green office teams set their consumption goals and
reporting consumption data


in 2013 the amount of office waste generated at spondas head office increased to 121 tonnes 2012 1154 the increase is partly attributable
to paper waste generated by the disposal of archived materials in conjunction with internal relocations

property locations
sponda takes environmental considerations into account in deciding on the locations for its property investments the
companys properties are in key areas in major cities and in locations accessible by public transportation which helps
reduce the environmental impacts of the properties during their use

the key aspects of the priority are

   taking environmental aspects into account in making decisions on property investments
   focusing on properties located in cities accessible by public transportation
   concentrating on prime areas



why is this a priority

for sponda the central location of its properties is a key strategic choice the companys properties are in key areas in helsinki metropolitan
area and tampere within the existing urban structure and in locations with good public transport links this strategy supports spondas
commitment to environmental responsibility


location is also one of the criteria applied in the environmental certification of business properties the breeam and leed certification
processes take into account not only the energy consumption of the building but also factors such as public transport links and bicycle parking
facilities


spondas investment strategy is also financially sustainable and responsible the demand and rental levels for properties located in the central
areas of cities are more stable even in economically uncertain times approximately 80 per cent of spondas properties are located in these
areas the investment strategy also supports the comprehensive sustainability of spondas operations

some 7000 square metres of new or renovated retail space in the complex the shopping centres location across from railway station
accessible by all modes of public transport is excellent for both those who work in the citycenter building and its customers the multiyear
project carried out over several phases made the traditional retail block significantly more comfortable improved pedestrian access and boosted
the appeal of the surrounding area


sponda is prepared to commence the ratina shopping centre project in tamperes central business district in 2014 if the required preleasing
rate is achieved



longterm objectives

   increasing the share of shopping centres and office properties in the companys property portfolio




                                                                                                                                                 20

   developing the property portfolio by concentrating on prime areas and locations with good public transport links




enhancing the customer experience
sponda aims to develop interactive longterm partnerships with its customers spondas expertise allows it to offer
customers business premises that are precisely tailored to their needs


the key aspects of the priority are

   identifying customer needs and responding to them
   taking a more proactive approach to customer relationships
   creating the conditions for longterm partnerships



why is this a priority

in the property sector customer relationships are typically long term the process of finding the right business premises takes time and leases
are signed for periods of several years in customer relationships spondas goal is to achieve a longterm interactive partnership rather than a
unilateral lessortenant relationship this allows the customer to receive the maximum benefit from the expertise of spondas personnel and its
comprehensive portfolio of business premises


at the end of 2013 sponda had a total of 1984 customers and 3037 lease agreements the largest client sectors were the public sector retail
and banking



enhancing the customer experience in sponda

the key building blocks of the customer experience are functional and highquality business premises as well as skilled personnel who
understand customers needs customers expect the lessor to have comprehensive and indepth expertise in both the industry in general and the
property being leased good customer service provided via multiple channels is also essential


the customer experience often begins even before the actual customer relationship is established with this in mind spondas aim is to be easily
approachable via a variety of channels the customer experience does not end when the right business premises are found instead it develops
and strengthens throughout the customer relationship spondas process supporting the development of the customer experience is aimed at
identifying the best ways of working from the customers perspective


during the lessortenant relationship the emphasis is on property services the continuous development of the customer relationship and
maintaining active contact with the customer the aim of customer service operations is to allow the customer to focus on their own business
while sponda handles all propertyrelated services in cooperation with its property management partners



customers value spondas professional competence

sponda regularly surveys customer satisfaction through the different stages of the customer relationship in addition to carrying out inhouse
surveys sponda participates in customer satisfaction surveys conducted by kti property information ltd the kti survey is an annual
benchmark study involving a large number of industry participants in 2013 a total of 511 sponda customers participated in the benchmark
study their responses identified spondas strengths as professional competence expertise and image as a lessor sponda will use the results
of the study to further develop its ability to identify customer needs and improve the effectiveness of customer service


sponda will engage in further discussions on the issues highlighted in the study in customer meetings and strive to improve its operations based
on the survey results
