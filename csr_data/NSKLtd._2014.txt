         nizations to realize efficient and fair management under the supervision of the board
         of directors the corporate governance rules which are part of nsks inhouse
         regulations articulate the basic approach to and framework of corporate governance
         at the nsk group
               nsks efforts to strengthen corporate governance are based on the following
         four policies

         1 improve management flexibility by delegating more authority from the board of directors to
             operational organizations
         2 ensure the supervision of the operational organizations by the supervisory organizations by
             separating the former and the latter
         3 strengthen the supervision of the operational organizations by the supervisory organizations
             through close coordination between the former and the latter and
         4 increase management fairness by strengthening the compliance system

            the thing that surprised me about the course at the nsk manufacturing education and training
            center was the amount of time spent on lectures concerning people skills and teaching skills
            these two subjects were taught intensively for two hours a day over ten days even after mov
            ing on to the handson training i carried cards summarizing the main points of these peoplere
            lated topics i also repeatedly asked myself how i would teach new skills in ways that are easy
            to understand to my coworkers when i returned to my workplace
                  even for machining processes and equipment maintenance i repeated the basics and
            learned how to apply them i would definitely recommend the training center course especially
            to younger employees

    nsk micro precisions bearings helped me set the world record
    takahiko hasegawa president sorohamu co ltd aka taka yoyo champion
    i was working at setting a yoyo world record in the longest sleeper category in this event which measures how long a
    yoyo can spin on a single throw the bearing performance has a huge impact on the time recorded after trying various
    bearings i found that the nsk micro precision bearing suited me best working with the company on the development
    process i requested a lightweight bearing that rotated quickly and smoothly over the period of about a year and a half
    nsk prepared a series of prototypes each of which got more responsive and comfortable to use this hard development
    work finally paid off and in 2010 i managed to pull off a world record throw of 21 minutes and 21 seconds
         with nsk micro precision as my trusted partner i am ready to keep taking on new challenges

    there is growing concern around the world that an economic system based on mass production mass consumption
    and mass disposal will end up depleting a wide range of resources in the future against this backdrop companies are
    required to help build recyclingoriented societies by ensuring the efficient use of resources throughout the entire product
    lifecyclefrom the extraction of resources to product use to disposal additionally there is concern that the increase in
    worldwide demand for water will lead to the depletement of water resources in the future companies must therefore make

the nsk group is strengthening its initiatives to achieve the rigorous
goals it set for the effective utilization of resources recycling rate and
landfill disposal rate the group constantly pursues higher performance
on the 3rs it will also start working on reducing water usage per unit of
production
      manufacturing sites in japan have already achieved their goals
for zero emissions the elimination of landfill waste disposal with a
recycling rate close to 100 furthermore the group will make efforts to
reduce industrial waste per unit of production figure 1
