benefitting from internal efficiencies
and a more favorable business environment
the start of 2017 has confirmed the positive trends
seen in the second half of 2016 above all the return
to organic growth seen in the last two quarters in 2016
is continuing including the ongoing improvements we
have seen in brazil and a return of russian tourists in
selected markets we also continue to see a reduction
of currency volatility in emerging markets thanks to
the additional efficiencies we implemented over the
past 12 month our organization is ready to perform
backed by our solid strategy

positive fundamentals on the global economy and the
resilient growth in passenger numbers indicate a pos
itive overall business environment combined with our
focus on operational improvements and the already
signed additional space of 22000 m2 to be opened
in 2017 and beyond we expect a successful year for

     categories such as perfumes  cosmet
     ics food  confectionery wines  spirits
     watches  jewelry fashion  leather to

      shopping




in order to offer domestic passengers a
similar shopping experience like the one
offered to international travelers dufry
created a new retail concept a general
travel retail shop for domestic passen
gers which offers an assortment com
parable to a dutyfree shop

at our dufry shopping stores domestic
passengers are presented with the
same retail excellence they normally
find in international terminals with a
great variety of products from the most
prestigious brands combined with the
best customer service there are a num
ber of countries where domestic travel
ers account for the majority of passen
gers particularly in large countries such
as china the united states and brazil
thus offering additional potential to in
ternationalize this concept

the concept was first introduced in
brazil in a pilot at brasilia airport back
in 2014 given the successful launch we
expanded the concept to another 6 air
ports in brazil including galeão airport
in rio de janeiro and guarulhos airport
in são paulo as well as most recently in
viracopos and curitiba airports

e equity instruments
an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets
of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities equity instruments issued by the group
are recognized at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs repurchase of
dufrys own equity instruments is recognized and deducted directly in equity no
gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase sale issue or
cancellation of dufrys own equity instruments

f share capital
ordinary shares are classified as equity mandatory convertible notes are classified
as compound financial instruments see 23 g below

costs directly attributable to the issuance of shares or options are shown in the state
ment of changes in equity as transaction costs for equity instruments net of tax

when any subsidiary purchases dufry shares treasury shares the consideration
paid including any directly attributable expenses net of income taxes is deducted
from equity until the shares are cancelled assigned or sold where such ordinary
shares are subsequently sold any consideration received net of any direct trans
action expenses and income tax is included in equity

g compound financial instruments
compound financial instruments issued by dufry comprise convertible notes that
can be converted to share capital the number of shares to be issued is dependent
on the changes in their fair value

the liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognized initially
at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option
the equity component is recognized initially at the difference between the fair value
of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability
component and is represented in equity for the date of inception the directly attri
butable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in
proportion to their initial carrying amounts

subsequent to initial recognition the liability component of a compound financial
instrument is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method the
equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured except
on conversion or expiry

the liability component is classified as current liabilities unless dufry has an
unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the end of the
 reporting period

h leases
leases of property plant and equipment where the group as lessee has substan
tially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases finance
leases are capitalized at the leases inception at the fair value of the leased prop
erty or if lower the present value of the minimum lease payments the correspond
ing rental obligations net of finance charges are included in other shortterm and
longterm payables each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance
cost the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of
the liability for each period the property plant and equipment acquired under
finance leases is depreciated over the assets useful life or over the shorter of the
 assets useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the
 group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term

leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not
transferred to the group as lessee are classified as operating leases payments
made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are
charged to profit or loss on a straightline basis over the period of the lease

i linearization
in cases where fees for the concession are based on fixed or determinable amounts
of money the expenses paid are treated as operational leases for these operational
leases when the amounts are increasing or decreasing over the time dufry accrues
the difference between the amount paid and the respective straightline expenses
for the period calculated over the overall duration of the contract as linearization
in addition this line item includes the reduction in concession payments granted
based on an upfront payment done at the inception of two spanish contracts
madrid and barcelona as main airports acquired as part of the world duty free
 acquisition see note 61

j pension and other postemployment benefit obligations
the employees of the subsidiaries are eligible for retirement invalidity and death
benefits under local social security schemes prevailing in the countries concerned
and defined benefit or defined contribution plans provided through separate funds
insurance plans or unfunded arrangements the pension plans are either funded
through regular contributions made by the employer or the employee or unfunded

the cost of providing benefits under defined benefit plans is determined using the
projected unit credit method

remeasurements the effect of the asset ceiling excluding net interest and the
return on plan assets excluding net interest are recognized in the statement of
financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive
income in the period in which they occur remeasurements are not reclassified
 to profit or loss in subsequent periods

past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of
 the date of the plan amendment or curtailment and
 the date that dufry recognizes restructuring related costs




                                                                                          105

net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit
obligation asset dufry recognizes the following changes in the net defined bene
fit obligation in the income statement
 service costs comprising current service costs past service costs gains and
    losses on curtailments and nonroutine settlements under personnel expenses
 net interest expense or income under interest expenses or income

k sharebased payments
equity settled share based payments to employees and other third parties provid
ing services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at grant date
the fair value determined at grant date of the equitysettled sharebased payments
is expensed on a pro rata basis over the vesting period based on the estimated
number of equity instruments that will eventually vest at the end of each reporting
period dufry revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to
vest the impact of the revision of the original estimates if any is recognized in the
income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate

where the terms of an equity settled award are modified the minimum expense
recognized is the expense as if the terms had not been modified an additional
expense is recognized for any modification which increases the total fair value of
the sharebased payment arrangement or is otherwise beneficial to the holder of
the option as measured at the date of modification

l taxation
income tax expense represents the sum of the current income tax and deferred
tax where a different functional currency is used the position includes the changes
in deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities due to foreign exchange translation

income tax positions not relating to items recognized in the income statement are
recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehen
sive income or equity

current income tax
income tax receivables or payables are measured at the amount expected to be
recovered from or paid to the tax authorities the tax rates and tax laws used to
compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted at the
reporting date in the countries where dufry operates and generates taxable income

income tax relating to items recognized in other comprehensive income is recog
nized in the same statement

deferred tax
deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between
the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial report
ing purposes at the reporting date

deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except
 when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or
  an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at
  the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable
  profit or loss
 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in
  subsidiaries when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can
  be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse
  in the foreseeable future

deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences the
carry forward of unused tax credits or tax losses deferred tax assets are recog
nized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against
which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax
credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except
 when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference
   arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is
   not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither
   the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss
 in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in
   subsidiaries deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is
   probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future
   and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can
   be utilized

the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will
be available to allow the deferred tax asset to be utilized unrecognized deferred
tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent
that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax
asset to be recovered

deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected
to apply in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled based on
tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the
reporting date applicable for each respective company

m property plant and equipment
these are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in fair
value depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term the useful lives applied are
as follows
 real estate buildings 20 to 40 years
 leasehold improvements the shorter of the lease term or 10 years
 furniture and fixtures the shorter of the lease term or 5 years
 motor vehicles the shorter of the lease term or 5 years
 computer hardware the shorter of the lease term or 5 years

n intangible assets
these assets mainly comprise of concession rights and brands dufry considers
that these assets have indefinite useful lives when concession rights are granted
by one of the noncontrolling interests holder of the company or for brands when
the company considers to use the brand for the foreseeable future intangible
assets acquired separately are capitalized at cost and those from a business
combination are capitalized at fair value as at the date of acquisition following
initial recognition the cost model is applied to intangible assets the useful lives
of these intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite intangible
assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life intangible
assets with an indefinite useful life are reviewed annually to determine whether the
indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable if not any changes are made
on a prospective basis

o impairment of nonfinancial assets
intangible assets with indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are
tested annually for impairment assets that are subject to depreciation and amor
tization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recog
nized when the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value
less cost of disposal and its value in use for the purpose of assessing impairment
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable
cash inflows cash generating units

p noncurrent assets held for sale or for distribution to equity holders
of the parent and discontinued operations
dufry classifies investments as held for sale or for distribution to equity holders
of the parent if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale
or distribution rather than through continuing use dufry measures these at the
lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell or to distribute

assets and liabilities classified as held for sale or for distribution are presented
separately in the statement of financial position

a disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation if it is
 a major line of business or major geographical area
 part of a single coordinated plan for disposal or
 a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale

discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations
and are presented as a single amount as net earnings after tax from discontinued
operations in the consolidated statement of income

q associates
associates are all entities over which dufry has significant influence but not
control generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 20  of the voting
rights investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting under the equity method the investment is initially recognized at cost
the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the investors share
of the net earnings of the investee after the date of acquisition and decreased by
dividends declared dufrys investment in associates includes goodwill identified
on acquisition

consolidated financial statements
dufry annual report 2016




dufrys share of postacquisition net earnings is recognized in the income state
ment and its share of postacquisition movements in other comprehensive income
is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding
adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment when dufrys share of losses
in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate dufry does not
recognize further losses unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations
or made payments on behalf of the associate if the ownership interest in an asso
ciate is reduced but significant influence is retained only a proportionate share of
the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified
to net earnings where appropriate

dufry determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence
that the investment in the associate is impaired if this is the case dufry calculates
the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of
the associate and its carrying value and recognizes the amount adjacent to share
of result of associates in the income statement

profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between
dufry and its associate are recognized in the groups financial statements only to
the extent of unrelated investors interests in the associates unrealized losses are
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred accounting policies of associates have been changed where neces
sary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by dufry

dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognized in the
income statement

r inventories
inventories are valued at the lower of historical cost or net realizable value the
historical costs are determined using the fifo method historical cost includes all
expenses incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condi
tion this includes mainly import duties and transport cost purchase discounts
and rebates are deducted in determining the cost of inventories the net realizable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale inventory allowances are set up in
the case of slowmoving and obsolete stock expired items are fully written off

s trade and credit card receivables  trade payables
receivables and payables in respect of the sale  purchase of merchandise are
included in these positions

t cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand or current bank accounts as
well as shortterm deposits at banks with initial maturity below 91 days credit card
receivables with a maturity of up to 4 days are included as cash in transit short
term investments are included in this position if they are highly liquid readily
convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes
in value in 2016 there were no shortterm deposits due within 90 days 2015
chf 295 million

u provisions
provisions are recognized when the group has a present obligation legal or construc
tive as a result of a past event it is probable that dufry will be required to settle
the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation



                                                                                          109

consolidated financial statements
dufry annual report 2016




the amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate at the end of the report
ing period of the consideration required to settle the present obligation taking into
account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation when a provision
is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation its
carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows where the effect of the
time value of money is material

when some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected
to be recovered from a third party a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is
virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received and the amount of the
receivable can be measured reliably

contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination
contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination are initially measured at
fair value at the acquisition date at the end of subsequent reporting periods such
contingent liabilities are measured at the higher of the amount that would be rec
ognized in accordance with ias 37 provisions contingent liabilities and contingent
assets and the amount initially recognized less cumulative amortization recognized
in accordance with ias 18 revenue

onerous contracts
present obligations arising under onerous contracts are measured and recognized
as provisions an onerous contract is considered to exist if dufry has a contract
under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract
exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract

restructurings
a restructuring provision is recognized when dufry has developed a detailed formal
plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that
it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing
its main features to those affected by it the measurement of a restructuring pro
vision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring which
are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not
associated with the ongoing activities of the entity

v financial instruments
financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value transaction
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets
and financial liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value
through profit or loss fvtpl are deducted from or added to the fair value of the
financial assets or financial liabilities on initial recognition transaction costs directly
attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value
through profit or loss are recognized immediately in the income statement

trade and other accounts receivable
trade and other receivables including credit cards receivables other accounts
receivable cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method less any impairment

dufry annual report 2016




impairment of financial assets
financial assets other than those at fvtpl are assessed for indicators of impair
ment at the end of each reporting period financial assets are considered to be
impaired when there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events
that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset the estimated
future cash flows of the financial asset have been affected certain categories of
financial assets such as trade receivables are assessed for impairment individually
subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the
allowance accounts for these categories changes in the carrying amount of the
allowance account are recognized in the income statement in the lines selling
expenses or other operational result

derecognition of financial assets
dufry derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash
flows from the asset expire or when it transfers the financial asset and substan
tially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity if dufry
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
and continues to control the transferred as set dufry recognizes its retained
interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay if
dufry retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred
financial asset dufry continues to recognize the financial asset and also recog
nizes a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received

financial liabilities at fvtpl
these are stated at fair value with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement
recognized in the income statement the net gain or loss recognized in the consol
idated income statement incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability
and is included in the financial result in the income statement fair value is deter
mined in the manner described in note 37

other financial liabilities
other financial liabilities including borrowings are subsequently measured at
amortized cost using the effective interest method

derecognition of financial liabilities
dufry derecognizes financial liabilities only when the obligations are discharged
cancelled or expired the difference between the carrying amount of the financial
liability derecognized and the consideration paid or payable is recognized in the
consolidated income statement

offsetting of financial instruments
financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported
in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforce
able legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle
on a net basis to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously see
note 3810

w derivative financial instruments
dufry enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its expo
sure to interest rate or foreign exchange rate risks including foreign exchange
forward contracts interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps further details
of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 38




                                                                                         111

derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts
are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end
of each reporting period the resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income
statement unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument
in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on
the nature of the hedge relationship

embedded derivatives
derivatives embedded in nonderivative host contracts are treated as separate
derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of
the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at fvtpl

x hedge accounting
dufry designates certain hedging instruments which include derivatives and non
derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk as either fair value hedges cash flow
hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations hedges of foreign
exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges

at the inception of the hedge relationship the entity documents the relationship
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item along with its risk manage
ment objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions fur
thermore at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis dufry documents
whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values
or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk

hedge accounting is discontinued when dufry revokes the hedging relationship
when the hedging instrument expires or is sold terminated or exercised or when
it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting any gain or loss recognized in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time is recognized when
the underlying hedged item is ultimately derecognized in the income statement

cash flow hedges
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated
and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in the hedging and revaluation reserves the gain or loss relating to
the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement and is included in
the interest expenses  income line item

fairvalue hedges
when a hedging instrument is used to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value
changes in the fair value of the instrument are recognized in other comprehensive
income the derivative instrument used is interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate
risk on borrowings if the hedge relationship is discontinued the carrying amount
of the hedged item is adjusted with the accumulated amount referring to the hedge
relationship

hedges of net investments in foreign operations
hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash
flow hedges any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective
portion of the hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumu
lated under the heading of translation reserves the gain or loss relating to the
ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement and is
included in the foreign exchange gains  losses line item see notes 311 and 312

3       critical accounting judgments and key sources
         of estimation uncertainty

the preparation of dufrys financial statements requires management to make
judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of income
expenses assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the
reporting date

key sources of estimation uncertainty

the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation
include uncertainties at the reporting date which may have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial periods are discussed below

concession rights
concession rights acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value
as at the date of acquisition the useful lives of operating concessions are assessed
to be either finite or indefinite based on individual circumstances and are con
sidering extensions and renewals the useful lives of operating concessions are
reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life assessment for
those concessions continues to be sustainable dufry annually tests the operat
ing concessions with indefinite useful lives and assesses those with finite lives for
impairment indications the underlying calculation requires the use of estimates
the comments and assumptions used are disclosed in note 2012

onerous contracts
some of the longterm concession agreements described above include clauses
to prevent early termination such as obligations to fulfill guaranteed minimal pay
ments during the full term of the agreement the conditions for an onerous con
tract will be met when such a contract presents a nonprofitable outlook in this
event a provision based on the present value of the unavoidable future negative
cash flows expected by the management is established the unavoidable costs are
the lower of the costs of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from
failure to fulfil it further details are given in note 32

brands and goodwill
dufry tests these items annually for impairment the underlying calculation requires
the use of estimates the comments and assumptions used are disclosed in
note 201

income taxes
dufry is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions significant judgment is
required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes there are many
transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax assessment is uncertain
dufry recognizes liabilities for tax audit issues based on estimates of whether
additional taxes will be payable where the final tax outcome is different from the
amounts that were initially recorded such differences will impact the income tax
or deferred tax provisions in the period in which such assessment is made further
details are given in notes 15 and 22

dufry annual report 2016




deferred tax assets
deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses and deductible tempo
rary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available
against which the losses can be utilized management judgment is required to deter
mine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized based upon the
likely timing and level of future taxable profits further details are given in note 22

provisions
management makes assumptions in relation to the expected outcome and cash
outflows based on the development of each individual case further details are
given in note 32

sharebased payments
dufry measures the cost of equity settled transactions with employees by refer
ence to the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date estimating such
fair values require determining the most appropriate valuation model for a grant
of equity instruments which depends on the terms and conditions of the grant as
well as the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected
probability that the triggering clauses will be met the result will be the expected
quantity of shares to be assigned the assumptions and models used are disclosed
in note 28

pension and other postemployment benefit obligations
the cost of defined benefit pension plans is determined using actuarial valuations
the actuarial valuation involves assumptions about discount rates future salary and
pension increases as well as mortality rates due to the longterm nature of these
plans such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty further details are given
in note 33

purchase price allocation
the determination of the fair values of the identifiable assets especially the con
cession rights and the assumed liabilities especially the contingent liabilities rec
ognized as provisions resulting from business combinations is based on valuation
techniques such as the discounted cash flow model some of the inputs to this model
are partially based on assumptions and judgments and any changes thereof would
affect the reported values see note 6

consolidation of entities where dufry has control
but holding only minority voting rights
dufry considers controlling certain entities even when it holds less than the major
ity of the voting rights when it is exposed to or has the rights to variable returns from
the involvements with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the entity these indicators are evaluated at the time of first consoli

4       new and revised standards and interpretations issued
         but not yet adopted  effective

the standards and interpretations described below are expected to have an impact
on dufrys financial position performance and  or disclosures dufry intends to
adopt these standards when they become effective

disclosure initiative  amendments to ias 7 statement of cash flows
effective january 1 2017
requires additional disclosure of changes in liabilities arising from financing
activities

ias 12
income taxes effective january 1 2017
additional amendments have been issued by the iasb regarding ias 12 on the
recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses these amendments clar
ify how to account for deferred tax assets related to debt instruments measured
at fair value

ifrs 9
financial instruments effective january 1 2018
phase 1 classification and measurement  determines how financial assets and
financial liabilities are accounted for and measured on an ongoing basis
phase 2 impairment  a new single expected loss impairment model is introduced
that will require more timely recognition of expected credit losses
phase 3 hedge accounting  the new model aligns the accounting treatment with
risk management activities users of the financial statements will be provided with
better information about risk management and the effect of hedge accounting on
the financial statements

the adoption of the first phase of ifrs 9 will have an effect on the classification
and measurement of dufrys financial assets but will not impact the financial
liabilities phase 2 is not expected to have any significant impact on the financial
statements and phase 3 is expected to affect the disclosure requirements

ifrs 15
revenue from contracts with customers effective january 1 2018
ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers deals with revenue recognition and
establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial state
ments about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from an entitys contracts with customers revenue is recognized when a
customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the
use and obtain the benefits from the good or service

the standard replaces ias 18 revenue and ias 11 construction contracts and re
lated interpretations dufry has analyzed the impact of the standard however has
not identified any material changes to the current revenue recognition approach
as dufry does not have customer contracts dufry considered the following aspects

a sale of goods
dufrys retail sales are in cash or credit card and the revenue recognition occurs
when the assets are transferred to the customer

b advertising income
advertising income is recognized when the services have been rendered

ifrs 16
leases effective january 1 2019
lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make
lease payments and a rightofuse asset for the right to use the underlying asset
for the lease term the lease liability will be measured at present value of the lease
payments to be made over the lease term in other words lessees will appear to
become more assetrich but also more indebted to be considered as such a lease
agreement has to convey the right to control the use of an identified asset through
out the period of use so that the customer has the right to obtain substantially all
of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and direct the use
of the identified asset ie direct how and for what purpose the asset is used

the standard will mainly affect the accounting of

a concession agreements
dufry enters into concession agreements with operators of airports seaports
railway stations etc to operate retail shops usually these arrangements require
a variable compensation based on sales or other activity indicators with a minimum
threshold in those cases where at the inception of the agreement the minimum
amounts can be calculated reliably over the respective contractual terms dufry
will account for this part as a lease in accordance with ifrs 16

b rent agreements for office and warehouse buildings
these agreements will usually qualify as leases under ifrs 16 except if the dura
tion is shorter than 12 months

dufry is currently conducting a detailed survey and compliance analysis of relevant
agreements and expects material changes in its statement of financial position

amendments that are considered to be insignificant from a current point of view

sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate
or joint venture proposed amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28
effective date not yet defined by iasb
the gain or loss resulting from the sale to or contribution from an associate of
assets that constitute a business as defined in ifrs 3 is recognized in full the gain
 or loss resulting from the sale to or contribution from a subsidiary that does not
 constitute a business as defined in ifrs 3 ie not a group of assets conforming a
 business to an associate is recognized only to the extent of unrelated investors
 interests in the associate

annual improvements 2014  2016  issued december 2016
ias 28 investment in associates and joint ventures effective january 1 2018
clarification that the election to measure at fair value through profit or loss is
available on an investmentbyinvestment basis upon initial recognition

5         segment information

dufrys risks and returns are predominantly affected by the fact that dufry operates
in different countries therefore dufry presents the segment information as it does
internally to the group executive committee using geographical segments and
the distribution centers as an additional segment

as of january 1 2016 after the acquisitions of the nuance and world duty free
businesses dufry implemented the new management organization resulting in five
geographical divisions and one global distribution center segment

we refer to the annex most important subsidiaries for the assignment of these
to the respective segments

2013 key assumptions used for valueinuse calculations
the calculation of valueinuse is most sensitive to the following assumptions
 sales growth
 growth rate used to extrapolate
 gross margin and suppliers prices
 concession fee levels
 discount rates

sales growth
sales growth is based on statistics published by external experts such as air4cast
or aci airports council international to estimate the development of interna
tional passenger traffic per country where dufry is active for the budget year the
management also takes into consideration specific price inflation factors of the
country the cross currency effect and the expected potential changes to capture
clients penetration per business unit

for the period after 5 years dufry has used a growth rate of 20   30  2015
20   30  to extrapolate the cash flow projections

gross margins
the expected gross margins are based on average product assortment values
estimated by the management for the budget 2017 these values are maintained
 over the planning period or where specific actions are planned and have been
 increased or decreased by up to 1  over the 5 year planning horizon compared to
  the historical data the gross margin is also affected by suppliers prices estimates
  are obtained from global negotiations held with the main suppliers for the products
  and countries for which products are sourced as well as data relating to specific
  commodities during the months before the budget

concession fee levels
these assumptions regarding the concession fee evolution are important and
monitored in the specific market as well as the renewal conditions and competitor
 behavior where the cgus are active for the cgus subject to a valueinuse
 calculation the management expects the competitive position to remain stable
  over the budget period

discount rates
several factors affect the discount rates
 for the financial debt part the rate is based on the average interest of the past
   5 years of the respective tenyear government bond and is increased by the
   companys effective bank spread and adjusted by the effective blended tax rate
   and country risk of the respective cgu
 for the equity part a 5  equity risk premium is added to the base rate commented
   above and adjusted by the beta of dufrys peer group

the same methodology is used by the management to determine the discount rate
used in discounted cash flow dcf valuations which are a key instrument to assess
business potential of new or additional investment proposals




                                                                                           141

2014 brands
dufry presented its new brand strategy in october 2015 while at corporate level
the group is recognized under the name of dufry for retail purposes it is apply
ing a multibrand concept including among others brands like dufry hudson
world duty free nuance hellenic duty free regstaer colombian emeralds duty
free caribbean do brasil and interbaires the book values of these brand names
remain at fair value recognized at acquisition and are subject to annual impairment
testing with regard to the assessment of valueinuse dufry believes that no
reasonably possible change    1  in any of the below key assumptions would
 cause that the recoverable amount falls materially below the carrying value of the
 respective brand name

the recoverable amount is determined using the relief of royalty method that con
siders a steady cash flow income from the royalty income after tax on projected
sales for each brand the following table indicates the key assumptions used for
the valuation of the main brands

    from payables for non trade services chf 132 million and to other accounts receivable chf  04 million



management believes that its provisions are adequate based upon currently avail
able information however given the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities in
the areas described below actual costs may vary from the amounts provisioned

contingent liabilities

dufry as internationally operating company is exposed to contingent liabilities in
respect of legal and tax claims in the ordinary course of business it is not antici
pated that any material liabilities will arise from the contingent liabilities other than
provided for

in 2016 the contingent liabilities decreased by chf 107 million and relate to the
reversal of the provision for vat in argentina in 2015 restated the contingent
liabilities increased by chf 89 million based on findings in europe recognized during
 the due diligence and the integration process made for the acquisition of the world
 duty free group

ifrs 3 business combinations requires to reflect these liabilities with uncertain
amounts in the statement of financial position although the risk exposure for some
of these positions has been regarded as medium or low the identified risks include
a variety of potential liabilities from past periods mainly related to the import and
sale of merchandise by entities under common control or regarding contributions
owed based on the contractual situation of employees as the identified risks implied
in these contingent liabilities are subject to interpretations and uncertainties in
the respective regulations the management made an estimation of the fair value




                                                                                                                                      159

onerous contracts

concession agreements usually fix the fee for the locations as a percentage on net
sales some of these longterm concession agreements which dufry has entered
into include clauses to ensure a minimal concession fee during the full term of the
agreement however in certain circumstances the economic environment around
an activity deteriorates in such a way that it is highly unlikely that the operation
will become profitable during the remaining concession duration in such cases
dufry does impair the assets subject to amortization or depreciation and creates
a provision for onerous contracts this provision reflects the present value of the
unavoidable cost losses of meeting the contractual obligation at balance sheet
date an amount of chf 1574 2015 1713 million has been provided in relation to
operations in asia europe and australia

close down

the provision of chf 89 2015 420 million relates mainly to the closing of operations
in asia and europe

labor disputes

the provision of chf 38 2015 23 million relates mainly to claims presented by sales
staff based on disputes related to the termination of temporary labor contracts
in brazil

lawsuits and duties

these provisions of chf 333 2015 217 million cover uncertainties dependent on
the outcome of law suits in relation to taxes duties or other claims in india turkey
united kingdom brazil ecuador and italy two of dufrys dormant operation in india
still keep two open claims chf 132 million in relation with customs duties and the
other in relation with service taxes dufry expects that both cases wont be finally
judged in the next year

other

these provisions relate mainly to the restoration of leased shops to their original
condition the charge for the year includes a provision for the expenses expected
to be incurred in relation to the structural improvements and the integration of
support functions of the organization the utilization of the year is mainly related
to the restructuring program in spain and the united kingdom

december 31 2016 is currently projected as follows
                                                                                                  expected

331     switzerland

dufry operates two company sponsored pension funds in form of foundations in
switzerland that provide contributionbased cash balance retirement and risk
benefits to employees all pension plans in switzerland are governed by the federal
 law on occupational retirement survivors and disability pension plans bvg which
 stipulates that pension plans are to be managed by independent legally autono
 mous units pension plans are overseen by a regulator as well as by a state super
 visory body a pension plans most senior governing body board of trustees must
 be composed of equal numbers of employee and employer representatives the
 various insurance benefits are governed in regulations with the bvg specifying
 the minimum benefits that are to be provided the employer and employees pay
 contributions to the pension plan in case of an underfunding various measures
 can be taken such as the adjustment of the pension benefits by altering the actu
 arial assumptions or increasing future contributions the employer can also make
 additional restructuring contributions the bvg prescribes how the employer and
 the employee have to jointly fund potential restructurings

these risks consist of demographic risks primarily life expectancy and financial
risks such as the discount rate future increases in salaries  wages and the return
on plan assets these risks are regularly assessed by the board of trustees in
addition two annual actuarial reports are submitted one in accordance with the
 requirements of the bvg the other in accordance with ifrs requirements

the investment strategy is defined in form of a longterm target asset currency
and riskstructure investment policy which takes into account requirements from
bvg and aim to obtain a high longterm return on plan assets the board of
trustees is responsible for the investment of the assets reviewing the investment
 portfolio as often as necessary  especially in the case of significant changes in
 the expectations of market developments and at least once a year when review
 ing the investment portfolio it takes into account the limitations set in the strategy
 the board of trustees delegates the implementation of the investment policy  in
 accordance with the investment strategy as well as various principles and objectives
  to an investment committee which consists of two members of the board of
 trustees they supervise the entire investment process the plan assets are managed
 by several external specialized and independent asset managers in accordance
 with the investment strategy whereby the investments in properties are directly
 managed by the fund

under swiss pension law dufry cannot recover any surplus from the pension funds
because those belong to the foundations

the pension funds currently invest in a diverse portfolio of asset classes including
equities bonds property and commodities but do not currently use any more
explicit assetliability matching strategy instruments such as annuity purchase
 products or longevity swaps

there have been the following changes made to the swiss retirement benefit
arrangements in the periods covered by these financial statements
 in october 2015 dufry informed their employees about the planned transfer of
   the pkw into the pvn as of january 1 2016 combined with this transfer the
   foundation board of the nuance group pension plan decided to change some
   of the plan benefits as from january 1 2016 resulting in a plan change for all
   pension plan members the plan change resulted in a past service credit of
   chf 33 million which has been recognized in the 2015 pension expenses

36      commitments and contingencies

guarantee commitments

some longterm concession agreements which dufry has entered into include
obligations to fulfill minimal fee payments during the full term of the agreement

or a financial institution during the years 2016 or 2015 no party has exercised their
right to call upon such guarantees all accrued but still unpaid concession fees
are presented as liabilities in the balance sheet


37      fair value measurement

fair value of financial instruments carried at amortized cost

except as detailed in table quantitative disclosures fair value measurement hier
archy for assets below dufry considers that the carrying amounts of financial
assets and financial liabilities recognized in the financial statements approximate
 their fair values

the following tables provide the fair value measurement hierarchy of dufrys assets
and liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value
grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable
 level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted
   in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
 level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted
   prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either
   directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices
 level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that
   include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market
   data unobservable inputs

the sensitivity analysis includes all monetary assets and liabilities irrespective of
whether the positions are third party or intercompany dufry has considered some
intercompany longterm loans as net investment in foreign operations consequently
the related exchange differences are presented in other comprehensive income
and thereafter as translation reserve in equity and dufry has entered into cross
currency swaps to reduce the currency exposure

the foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign
exchange rate exposure of dufry entities at december 31 of the respective year
the values and risk disclosed here are the hedged and not hedged positions

 of the interest rate of all interest bearing financial positions

if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher whereas all other variables were
held constant dufrys net earnings for the year 2016 would decrease by chf 432
2015 decrease by 332 million

obligations resulting in financial loss to dufry

nized credit  debit cards dufry has policies in place to ensure that other sales are
only made to customers with an appropriate credit history or that the credit risk

             the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful live is tested annually for impairment the
             company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful live in the fourth
             quarter of 2016 and determined that there was no impairment key assumptions relating to the impairment test are
             disclosed in note 201 to the consolidated financial statements in determining the value in use of cash generating units
             and intangible assets with indefinite useful live the company must apply judgment in estimating  amongst other
             factors  future sales and margins longterm growth rates and discount rates due to the significance of the carrying
             values for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and the judgment involved in performing the impairment test
             this matter was considered significant to our audit

             our audit response
             our procedures included amongst other an assessment of the companys internal controls over its annual impairment
             test and key assumptions applied we also evaluated managements allocation of reporting units we involved valuation
             specialists to assist in examining the companys valuation model and analyzing the underlying key assumptions including
             future sales expected margins longterm growth rates and discount rates wacc we assessed the historical accuracy
             of the companys estimates and considered its ability to produce accurate longterm forecasts our work moreover
             included an evaluation of the sensitivity in the valuation resulting from changes to the key assumptions applied and
             a comparison of these assumptions to corroborating information including industry reports and statistics published
             by external experts to estimate the rate of future passenger growth

             concession contracts  onerous contracts
             area of focus
             capitalized concession rights amounting to chf 3822 million represent 39  of the balance sheet total as at
             31 december 2016 the useful life of virtually all concession rights are assessed to be finite concession rights acquired
             separately are capitalized at cost and those acquired in a business acquisition are capitalized at fair value as at the date
             of acquisition and are subject to impairment considerations as outlined in note 3 to the consolidated financial state
             ments in many instances concession agreements include a concession payment which is defined as a certain percent
             age on net sales some of these longterm concession agreements which dufry has entered into include clauses to
             ensure a minimal concession fee during the full term of the agreement minimal annual guarantees mag under certain
             circumstances the economic environment around an activity may deteriorate in such a way that it is unlikely that the
             operation will become profitable during the remaining concession duration in such cases dufry impairs tangible and
             intangible assets and creates if still needed a provision for onerous contracts the fair value calculation of concession
             rights as well as the determination of provision for onerous contracts comprise significant judgment of management

             our audit response
             in the course of our audit we assessed whether valid concession contracts are on hand and evaluated the concession
             fees including minimal annual guarantees we assessed managements process to identify potential impairments for
             capitalized concession rights in addition we focused on entities reporting negative cash flows in order to identify
             p otential impairment needs and potential onerous contracts in connection with the acquisition of wdf group we
              assessed the accounting treatment of acquired concession rights

             triggers various taxation obligations including corporation tax and employment related taxes the crossborder n        ature
             of the groups sale of goods also creates complexities associated with international transfer pricing application of
             taxation legislation to the groups affairs is inherently complex highly specialized and requires judgement to be exercised
             in relation to estimating tax exposures and quantifying provisions andor contingent liabilities as at 31 december 2016

             a deferred tax asset of chf 130 million we refer to note 22 of the financial statements this area was important to our
             audit due to the amount of the tax losses as well as the judgment involved in managements assessment of the likelihood
             and magnitude of creating future taxable profits to offset the tax losses this assessment requires the management
             board to make assumptions to be used in the forecasts of future taxable profits including expectations for future sales
             and margin developments and overall market and economic conditions

             our audit response

             authorities and the evaluation of tax exposures in addition in respect of deferred tax assets we assessed managements
              assumptions to determine the probability that deferred tax assets recognized in the statement of financial position
              will be recovered through taxable income in future years and available tax planning strategies we included tax spe
              cialists to evaluate the assumptions used to determine tax positions during our procedures we also used managements
              budgets and forecasts in addition where considered relevant we evaluated the historical accuracy of managements
              assumptions
