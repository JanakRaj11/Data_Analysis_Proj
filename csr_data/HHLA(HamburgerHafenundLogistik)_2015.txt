                                      cessful year the company succeeded in improving its revenue
                                      and operating result significantly in the 2014 financial year group
                                      revenue rose by more than 5 percent to  12 billion while the
                                      operating result ebit improved by 10 percent to  169 million
                                      we therefore exceeded our forecasts

                                      the operating environment was difficult however global economic
                                      growth was restrained and the trend in world trade also proved
                                      weaker than in the previous year both political and economic crises
                                      hampered throughput developments in markets of relevance to us

                                      extent on top of this the delay in dredging the river elbe which
                                      is urgently needed is having an increasingly serious impact on the

                                      was partly due to falling volumes in trade with russia caused largely

                                      put a new berth into operation this also sends out a clear signal

                                    whether the truck can be processed promptly depends
                                    partly on the traffic situation if the vehicles which transport
                                    containers to or from the terminal all arrive at the same time
                                    instead of being spread over the course of 24 hours the

                                     container with the aid of computers  rather than manually
                                     before the truck even arrives this saves time for both the
                                     terminals and the drivers the latter can be sure that their
                                     designated container really is ready for them the timely

                                     truck drivers will book a slot for each trip with the terminal
                                     they will thus know exactly when they need to be at the

                                   joint ventures ias 31 interests in joint ventures and sic 13 jointly controlled entities the new standard provides
                                   accounting guidance for companies which exercise joint control over a joint venture or joint operation the previous
                                   option of pro rata consolidation for joint ventures has been eliminated partners in a joint venture must henceforth use
                                   the equity method these amendments had no substantial impact on hhlas consolidated financial statements the
                                   figures for the previous year have been restated accordingly
ifrs 12 disclosure of interests    according to the ifrs 12 standard published in may 2011 companies must disclose details which enable users of
in other entities                  financial statements to assess the type of risks and financial consequences entailed in the companys interests in

associates and joint ventures      to be made of the equity method this explicitly includes joint ventures the regulations on material influence remained
amended in 2011                  unchanged now if an associate becomes a joint venture or vice versa it is still reported using the equity method and
                                   no revaluation is conducted this amendment had no impact on hhlas consolidated financial statements
