    1 a word from our ceo




    to our readers

    in the less than seven years since kbc was founded we have managed to become one of the
    most successful bancassurers in europe our bancassurance concept a success on our ﬁrst home
    market in belgium has also gradually been transposed to our second home market in central and
    eastern europe where we are currently already one of the largest ﬁnancial services group central
    and eastern europe is proving to be an important engine of growth for our group and we expect
    it to continue to help drive growth in the years ahead

    now that we have joined the ranks of the eurozones top ﬁnancial groups in terms of market
    capitalization it behoves us to enhance our transparency on all matters beyond our ﬁnancial
    performance a company after all is not just a compilation of facts and ﬁgures besides our im
    pressive ﬁnancial achievements we feel we have other reasons to be proud of our group kbc is
    a company with a rich history a clear vision for the future and a set of values that are an integral
    part of our corporate culture our employees are committed to the company which has found
    the wherewithal to grow and ﬂourish from within thanks to its faith in the capabilities of its own
    people despite our international scale we have always made a point of leaving the local roots
    intact to a large degree on our home markets respecting the individuality of each entity within
    the overall value framework of the group

    indeed this is the ﬁrst time that kbc is reporting on its performance with respect to corporate
    social responsibility csr the initial focus is on our ﬁrst home market belgium later editions
    will extend coverage to our central and eastern european operations sustainable and socially
    responsible business essentially entails planning and conducting ones business not only with
    a view to making a proﬁt but also with an eye to the economic social ecological and cultural
    impact of that business in both the short and the long term in light of this ethical behaviour and
    integrity are increasingly seen as key components of sound business practice public opinion and
    ever stricter legislation and regulation are obliging companies to pursue policies that pay proper
    attention to the various nonﬁnancial aspects of business this is not to suggest that csr was not
    previously practiced in one form or another within kbc in fact over the years kbc has played a
    pioneering role in many instances with respect to csr initiatives our mission statement reﬂects
    our commitment to our stakeholders and our principles for socially responsible business outlines
    our basic policy in this regard1 our pursuit of a socially responsible business policy is additionally

evidenced in our inhouse guidelines and codes of conduct in the many projects we sponsor and
the aid we provide through our group companies and in our product offering

however the exponential growth in importance of csr during the last few years within the
ﬁnancial arena and the continued expansion of our organization beyond belgiums borders has
meant that it is no longer sufﬁcient to subscribe to csr principles or guidelines without demon
strating what we have achieved in practice not only will this report enable us to adopt a more
proactive dialogue with our various stakeholders it will also help us to better identify our goals
for the future in light of the socalled triple bottom line or triplep concept  people planet

5 risk management at kbc

vision
risks are inherent in every business to help create lasting value for shareholders customers em
ployees and other stakeholders risks must be effectively managed so that both the expense they
entail and the relevant charge against capital are controlled

the businesses of banking and insurance are exposed to a number of typical risks credit risk
market risk and liquidity risk are the main types of risk affecting the banking business while
the insurance business has to contend primarily with investment risk and a variety of technical
risks on top of this both the bank and the insurance activities are exposed to operational risks
controlling all these risks is one of the most crucial tasks of group management

principles
at kbc value and risk management is based on the following fundamental principles
 value risk and capital management are inextricably linked to one another every companys aim
  is to create value to achieve this aim decisions are taken and activities developed even though
  there is no certainty as to where they will lead to ensure its own continuity a company must have
  adequate capital to be able to deal with any unforeseen consequences of adverse developments
 risk management should be approached from a comprehensive enterprisewide angle taking
  into account all the risks a company is exposed to and all the activities it engages in
 primary responsibility for value and risk management lies with line management while a sepa
  rate value and risk management directorate  operating independently of line management
   performs an advisory supporting and supervisory role
 every material banking and insurance subsidiary is required to adhere to the same risk govern
  ance model as the parent company
 the groups banking businesses have set up a market risk committee a credit risk committee
  an operational risk committee and an assetliability management committee alco
  while the insurance businesses have set up an insurance risk committee an operational risk
  committee and an alco

risk governance model
the value and risk management governance model which has been in place since 2004 seeks to
deﬁne the responsibilities and tasks of various bodies and persons within the organization with a
view to ensuring the sound management of value creation and all the associated risks to which
the banking and insurance businesses are exposed kbcs risk governance model is organized in
three tiers
 overarching company and risk committees the board of directors audit committee
  executive committee group alco insurance alco and bank alco these committees

       concentrate on global risk management and on monitoring value creation and capital ad
       equacy for the entire group
      specialized risk committees these committees concentrate on developing a groupwide frame
       work for one particular type of risk and monitoring the associated risk management process
      line management and activityspeciﬁc committees line management has primary responsibility
       for value and risk management the value and risk management directorate measures risks
       economic capital and value creation for all relevant business entities and reports its ﬁndings
       directly to line management and the relevant activityspeciﬁc committees
      the compliance division and internal audit departments see p 22

18   chief financial ofﬁcerchief risk ofﬁcer
     strong centralized risk management is set up at kbc group level under the direction of the
     group chief financial ofﬁcer and chief risk ofﬁcer cfocro although the cfocro is not a
     member of the kbc group nv executive committee he has a standing invitation to attend all of
     its meetings for those items on the agenda that are within his functional expertise he periodi
     cally informs the board of directors of the overall risk proﬁle and risk management of kbc group
     and seeks approval for the overall risk appetite

     board of directors and the audit committee
     the board of directors and the audit committee have an important role to play in value creation
     and risk governance regular reporting to the audit committee ensures that there is an ample
     ﬂow of information to the relevant members of the board of directors over the course of the
     year moreover through the involvement of the entire board in the annual round of approvals of
     risktolerance limits the board is able to take informed decisions on the degree of risk it ﬁnds ac
     ceptable for kbc and on the adequacy of the risk management structure

     executive committee and the assetliability management committees alcos
     the executive committee is responsible for the implementation of the value and risk manage
     ment strategy and outlines the structure and makes the necessary resources available to allow
     the risk management tasks to be carried out the cfocro is entrusted with the speciﬁc task of
     supervising risk management and the internal control structure

     to make certain that the insurers investment decisions are not inspired by information available
     in the bank that is not in the public domain and vice versa the group alco is split into three
     committees a group alco a bank alco and an insurance alco the latter two manage the
     alm positions of the bank and the insurer respectively besides supervising concentration risk
     managing groupwide credit risks at portfolio level and monitoring preparations for implement
     ing the basel ii and solvency ii guidelines the group alco is responsible for establishing mirror
     portfolios and developing capital management

1 employee satisfaction

employee satisfaction is an ongoing concern and regular surveys are carried out twice a year in
belgium to measure it based on the results of these surveys selective measures are taken where
necessary employee satisfaction towards kbc as employer remains at very high levels the results
of surveys conducted in 2004 for kbc bankasset managementholding company were as fol
lows 36 of the employees were very to extremely satisﬁed 58 were satisﬁed 5 were not
very satisﬁed and 1 dissatisﬁed this is a clear improvement when compared with 2002 data

 12 these ﬁgures are based on the number of staff at kbc belgiums main entities kbc bank kbc insurance kbc holding company
representing roughly 80 of kbc in belgium cf p 7 and include kbc belgiums staff working abroad

     the percentage of satisﬁed to extremely satisﬁed employees rose in two years from 91 to 94
     the sharpest rise was in the verytoextremelysatisﬁed category 30 to 36 the results have
     been communicated extensively via kbcs inhouse magazine and explained to the employee
     representatives13

     in addition to surveys other measures have been put into place to enable employees to voice
     their opinions andor concerns kbcs inhouse magazine regularly features articles on employ
     ees in particular departments or branches whilst the companys intranet includes an interactive
     online forum and suggestion box moreover employees may discuss personal problems conﬁ
     dentially with their personnel adviser or a member of the compliance division if the problem is
28   related to ﬁnancial ethics professional psychologists are also available for consultation within the
     medical service for particular problems arising from undesirable behaviour by members of staff
     including violence bullying and sexual harassment

     employee absenteeism may be construed as another indicator of employee satisfaction
     according to the table above employee absenteeism at kbc in belgium fell between 2003 and
     2004 moreover absenteeism due to sickness is not only in a downtrend but  at 271  was
     also very low in 2004

     a number of projects have been set up in belgium in recent years with a view to allowing em
     ployees to strike a better balance between their professional and private lives with incentives to
     lessen the stress of commuter travel these projects have included the introduction of ﬂextime
     and gliding schedules in the head ofﬁce buildings the reimbursement of expenses for regular
     commuter travel based on public transportation fares and for bicycle commuters a carpooling
     database hometeleworking schemes for certain departments and the provision of childcare
     during the holidays indeed according to a survey on workrelated stress conducted by a univer
     sity study group at various belgian banks in 2002 kbc employees saw their jobs as demanding
     but they were also aware that they have a say in the job content and can ensure that their skills
     are being put to good use this aspect was clearly more conspicuous at kbc than at other banks
     the survey additionally revealed that there are fewer stressrelated complaints at kbc than at
     other banks kbc employees therefore have less of a chance of burnout and are less prone to
     taking sick leave than employees at other banks

     in autumn 2004 kbc launched an internal staff insurance and pensions campaign for all its
     employees in belgium with a view to making them aware of the wide range of staff insurance
     products and the favourable pension plan on offer an extensive information round was also
     organized concerning a number of adjustments to the pay and promotion policy from 2005
     onwards designed to make this policy even more objective and transparent

     13 the preliminary results of the latest survey conducted during 2005 showed a further rise in overall employee satisfaction probably
     partly inﬂuenced by the positive mood regarding the economic climate

2 stafﬁng levels and remuneration policy

stafﬁng levels
in 2004 the total number of employees in the group fell by approximately 8 to 46 554 full
time equivalents ftes15 if the reduction in the stafﬁng level resulting from the sale of certain
kredyt bank poland subsidiaries is not taken into account the decline came to slightly less than
4 the reduction in the workforce at kbc belgium over the past few years due in part to the
implementation of the merger has been achieved through natural attrition an increase in part
time work easier transfers to other group companies various job openings at kbc insurance
were ﬁlled by kbc bank staff and a strict limit on external recruitment gradually however
external recruitment is getting under way again to replace staff leaving the internal labour                                29
market was also reopened in early 2005 with vacancies being advertised inhouse ﬁrst so as to
give employees the opportunity to further their careers or take up new challenges as part of the
integration of the bank and the insurers human resources functions the respective recruitment
and selection services of kbc bank and kbc insurance have been brought under one manage
ment thereby enhancing kbcs proﬁle in the labour market

remuneration policy
kbc operates an equal pay policy for men and women with the same job content and job grade
both in terms of basic monthly salary and as regards bonuses and other fringe beneﬁts each pay
scale increase is communicated in writing or electronically to all employees of the division in ques
tion this reﬂects the banks commitment to maximum openness and objectivity with regard to
pay and promotion

nonmanagement staff members receive a certain salary scale based on job content and per
formance the remuneration ﬁxed and variable is strictly stipulated for each pay scale and
increases only with age this means that men and women always receive identical salaries within
their pay scale and based on their age as well as identical fringe beneﬁts and identical bonuses in
the event of identical performance

transfer to a structurally higher pay scale requires an objective pay scale review which looks only
at the competences of the candidate not at their gender ethnic origin etc



3 equal treatment and nondiscrimination

it is basic kbc policy to treat all members of staff equally for instance in its staff regulations
and its selection and promotion policy and performance appraisal systems kbc does not make
any distinction whatsoever on the grounds of sex religion ethnic background or sexual orienta
tion etc its mission statement makes it clear that kbc will not tolerate any undesirable behaviour
whatsoever kbc has also drawn up and communicated a procedure via the intranet to preclude
or do away with all forms of violence bullying and sexual harassment at work
15 see table in appendix ib on p 58
16 covers kbc bankasset managementholding companyinsurance including branch network but excluding independent insurance
agencies rougly 80 of kbc in belgium p 7
17 excludes new recruits on a temporary contract
18 these numbers appear to be high but include employees who transferred to other kbc group companies

     women employees
     the percentage of women in management functions has been a continual area of attention for
     kbc the promotion of women to management posts is related to the number of highly qualiﬁed
     female applicants and the resultant appointments these numbers have improved considerably in
     recent years and women now account for approximately 50 of appointments at graduate or
     university level the number of qualiﬁed women joining the bank has been at consistently high
     levels in recent years and this has resulted in a continuous increase in the number of women in
     management functions

     within kbc  where we operate a policy of the right person in the right place a number of
30   female managers and directors are currently studying ways of increasing the number of female
     employees rising to more senior positions within the company

     to facilitate a healthy worklife balance kbc has implemented a large number of initiatives
     including parttime working providing childcare facilities during holidays ﬂexible working hours
     local working measures to resolve mobility problems subsidising public transport bicycle grants
     etc these measures are also open to employees in middlemanagement posts according to the
     traditional role patterns in belgium it is mainly women who make use of these services though
     an increasing number of men are also doing so these measures promote participation  including
     by women  in the employment process and enable them to combine jobs carrying a higher level
     of responsibility with their family life

     to make female employees of the bank aware of this issue kbc issued a special edition of its
     inhouse magazine dedicated to women staff members on 8 march 2005 commemorating the
     international womens day in which female employees were free to give their opinions on the
     banks policy on women

     the table and bar chart above shows that women are in the overwhelming majority amongst the

     entered the workforce in recent years

nondiscrimination
discrimination in all forms is tightly regulated in belgium by a whole body of laws and regula
tions they are designed to protect all ethnic groups and their scope also covers discrimination on
the grounds of nationality age religion sexual orientation disability and present or future health
conditions as an important player on the belgian market kbc group complies strictly with the
antidiscrimination legislation in force

in the code of conduct for kbc group employees cf wwwkbccom kbc explicitly endorses the
vlaams manifest van het bedrijfsleven tegen sociale uitsluiting van migranten flemish trade
and industry manifesto against the social exclusion of migrants drawn up by the vev
the flemish employers federation which clearly reﬂects its intention to take up the challenge of                 31
preventing and combating the social exclusion of migrants and promoting their economic and
social integration

kbc group is also a signatory to the ondernemers tegen racisme en voor diversiteit flemish
entrepreneurs against racism and for diversity charter kbc condemns and forbids any
form of discrimination in the recruitment and promotion process throughout all its entities world
wide

in addition cera one of kbc groups core shareholders is a cooperative enterprise whose ob
ject includes supporting social and community projects as well as initiatives designed to encour
age social equality see wwwcerabe

finally it should be mentioned that kbc is opposed to any form of child labour or forced la
bour both of which are prohibited by law in belgium



4 social dialogue

in belgium both positive and negative freedom of association are guaranteed by the act of
24 may 1921 this is much broader in scope than the international labour organisation ilo
conventions 87 and 9820 ratiﬁed by belgium which guarantee positive freedom of association
only the right to collective bargaining is enshrined in belgiums collective agreements and joint
committees act of 5 december 1968 this law stipulates that employee representative organiza
tions alone are authorized to take part in such actions

at kbc every employee may become a member of one of the employee unions or submit
hisher candidacy via such an organization for a mandate in the ofﬁcial consultative bodies the
employee unions at kbc have access to more facilities than is legally required eg number of
mandates in consultative bodies setting up of a european works council even before the imple
mentation of a european directive in this regard etc kbcs desire to maintain social dialogue is
illustrated by the fact that the trade unions are viewed as true social partners and are continually
involved  both formally and informally  in kbcs operations additionally kbc helped to set up
consultative bodies for junior and senior management employees based on the notion of partici
pative management

the trade unions represent all employees at the consultative forums employees can elect their
representatives at the social elections which take place every four years the latest round took
place in may 2004 following convocations from kbc and the trade unions to appoint representa

20 ilo 87 freedom of association and protection of the right to organize convention ratiﬁed on 23 october 1951
ilo 98 right to organize and collective bargaining convention ratiﬁed on 10 december 1953

     tives to the works councils and the occupational health and safety committees 90 of the kbc
     staff cast their vote in the social elections which is a high rate of participation for belgium and
     further evidence of the constructive nature of social dialogue at kbc

     additionally in 2004 kbc worked very closely with the unions holding talks with the works
     councils the health and safety committees union representatives the european works council
     and other consultative bodies in belgium a collective labour agreement providing for an increase
     in purchasing power by means of a oneoff gross premium was concluded in 2004 in both the
     banking and the insurance sectors a number of collective labour agreements caos were con
     cluded speciﬁcally for kbc bank and the kbc holding company in the same year with regard to
32   such matters as an ageaware personnel policy and support and guidance measures for employ
     ees involved in orbay the joint venture between kbc and rabobank nederland for the process
     ing of securities transactions the standard employment regulations were also amended and
     updated in the insurance business and a cao was concluded with a view to standardizing closing
     days and replacement days for public holidays within the kbc group entities in belgium



     5 talent development and knowledge management

     kbcs vision on training is based on the fundamental belief that everyone has talents that appro
     priate remuneration should be paid for these talents and that opportunities should be provided
     for their further development talent development is not however just a matter of taking courses
     but starts with the individual employee and developmental needs and possibilities are therefore a
     standard element in the feedback and job performance interviews with line managers

     kbc offers a differentiated range of developmental possibilities taking account of an individuals
     various skills various types of training tools are available classical individual study learning on
     the job etc across the entire banking and insurance spectrum and employees may consult and
     sign up for courses via an inhouse online catalogue depending on the envisaged goal kbc
     arranges courses for inclass training individual study or elearning while employees may also
     opt for nonworkrelated evening courses free of charge speciﬁc training programmes for new
     employees and particular job categories are also provided as well

     in 2004 a number of the bank and the insurers training departments in belgium were trans
     ferred to the holding company so that the scope of their activities now encompasses several
     belgian group entities the career screening systems of kbc bank and kbc insurance in belgium
     have been brought into line with one another with a view to establishing a groupwide career
     policy employees competencies are identiﬁed by means of career surveys this in turn enables
     customized career development plans to be drawn up and facilitates the exchange of compe
     tencies within the group on an objective basis

     further improvements were made to the efﬁciency of human resources management and training
     for example through the introduction of a new sap software package system analysis and program
     development for training administration the farreaching integration of commercial and skills train
     ing in a single kbc skills centre the consolidation of commercial training projects at cluster level
     and the already noted integration of training activities at the bank and the insurance company new
     instruments have also been introduced for identifying and managing knowledge while the range of
     ﬂexible forms of learning such as elearning and onthejob learning has been extended by way of
     support for independent insurance agents and their staff an intensive training programme has been
     set up for new agents in speciﬁc areas eg ﬁnancial management as well

attention has also been devoted to expanding the training programme to kbc entities outside of
belgium with customized projects being set up in a number of central european group compa
nies moreover talent management is increasingly being handled at international level an ex
ample of this type of management is the intensive twiceyearly kbc academy programme for
promising young high potentials throughout the groups network worldwide the ﬁrst session of
which was held in spring 2005

6 health and safety

kbc has a sizeable prevention department covering all group entities in belgium its main
focus is on the prevention of occupational accidents the prevention department is divided into
several areas of expertise including a medical service with certiﬁed doctors and nurses spread
across various locations in belgium for employee use professional psychologists advisers in
ergonomics and hygienesanitation all professionals are encouraged to keep up to date in their
ﬁeld via internal or external courses kbc also operates a prevention policy via regional commit
tees where employer and employee representatives meet on a monthly basis in order to pursue
preventive policy with a view among other things to avoiding accidents at work

two indicators used by kbcs prevention department with regard to occupational accidents is the
frequency22 and severity 23 of accidents at work including commuting tofrom work reported
on an annual basis these statistics enable kbc to compare its performance with that of the rest
of the belgian services sector

     in 2004 kbc recorded a frequency of 43 occupational accidents and a severity of 006 a clear
     decline from the year before and much lower than the average for the belgian services sector in
     2003 2376 and 054 respectively

34   in the event that a workrelated accident nonetheless occurs kbc has taken out insurance which
     also covers accidents occurring on the way to and from work this insurance covers the medi
     cal costs and guarantees a substantial net income which approaches the employees normal in
     come moreover kbc also provides assistance in the case of other nonworkrelated accidents
     or hospital admissions eg payment of hospitalization expenses via an insurance policy guaran
     teed income repatriation from abroad income topup in the event of longterm incapacity for
     work etc in the event of death  whether or not due to a workrelated accident  there are also
     a number of ﬁnancial assistance schemes for the next of kin a lifelong annuity for the spouse
     and minor children etc

     employees are also offered the option of enrolling in a pension plan via
     1 one funded by the employer which ensures that employees receive a substantial amount on
         retirement based on their length of service and their income from the bank during the preced
         ing ﬁve years this capital sum can be converted to a lifelong annuity
     2 one funded by the employee involving taxfriendly investment with a guaranteed minimum
         return

     kbc additionally provides health andor accident insurance for employees for example
     1 free hospitalization insurance which covers all costs of a hospital admission from three
         months before until six months after admission including medication doctors fees etc both
         before and afterwards
     2 accident insurance which also covers accidents on the way to work
     3 a guaranteed income in the event of incapacity for work which approaches the normal net
         income from employment
     4 personal assistance whilst abroad free medical care repatriation help searching for missing
         persons etc
     5 medical service with company doctors and nurses periodic medical checks facilities for cer

environmental stewardship
                                                                                                   37


      clearly a ﬁnancial group has less of a direct impact on the environment
      than for example an industrial concern but even so its impact is not negligi
      ble when it comes to such matters as energy consumption and mobility for
      instance there are signiﬁcant ways in which the environmental impact can
      be mitigated




growing concerns worldwide about climate change and the impact of greenhouse gases have
induced various efforts at corporate level to implement measures to tackle these issues kbc has
certainly not ignored the trend towards reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emis
sions and focusing on recycling waste products to help lessen the environmental impact indeed
over the years kbc has been closely associated with environmental concerns via its direct link
with argus an independent belgian organization providing information and knowhow on all
matters related to the environment see boxed text on p 44 and in 2003 kbc published its
environmental policy statement which summarizes its commitment to the environment from
both the operational and product aspects see boxed text on p 38
in keeping with the kbc environmental policy statement a multidisciplinary task force was
set up at the end of 2004 at kbc in belgium with responsibility for drawing up an overarching
environmental policy concerning kbcs direct environmental impact and focusing particularly
on energy waste and mobility members of the task force include representatives from various
belgian group entities including the facilities management personnel and it departments the
task force has formulated uniform environmental indicators and targets for energy conservation
and carbon dioxide emissions including that resulting from business travel among other things

1 recent achievements

                 kbcs head ofﬁce in brussels was awarded the ecodynamic company
                 label for the 20032006 period by the brussels institute for management of the
                 environment cf wwwibgebimbe this is the ﬁrst step in kbcs commitment
                 to move towards meeting the requirements in implementing the iso 14001
                 standard for environmental management systems

     kbcs environmental policy statement
     kbcs environmental policy statement is in line with its overall mission statement which true
     to the stakeholder model covers kbcs role within the communities it serves

     in keeping with this mission statement kbc observes certain principles with regard to its op
     erations and their impact on the environment and in each of its activities such as lending and
38   investment devotes all due consideration to environmental policy and ecological risks

     kbc is aware of the fact that it has a clear direct impact on the environment and that even in
     a serviceproviding and informationprocessing enterprise the rational use of natural resources
     can signiﬁcantly reduce this impact

     compliance with environmental legislation is naturally the very least that can be done but
     kbc also in so far as is economically feasible applies the highest possible technical standards
     and sets its own objectives for reducinglimiting its impact on the environment

     the indirect environmental impact which it generates via its customers through the sale of
     its products and services is however greater than its own direct impact consequently it
     will have an eye to the inﬂuence on the environment of companies and projects it ﬁnances
     through the advice and service it provides it will endeavour to preventatively limit the environ
     mental effects its customers may cause kbc will be assisted in this by argus an independent
     organization kbc has funded for more than thirty years and which has built up considerable
     knowhow in the area of environmental advice and policy

     scope
     operations
     kbc will ensure that its use of resources is as ecologically sound and as rational as possible
     and will pay particular attention its use of water and energy its consumption of products the
     prevention and processing of waste transportation and employeemobility the point of de
     parture here will be full compliance with the relevant laws and implementation of environmen
     tal performance systems inspired by ecomanagement and audit scheme emas legislation
     kbc endorses sustainable building principles and in providing accommodation for its work
     force takes account of such factors as the possible environmental impact as well as of em
     ployee comfort and efﬁciency
     kbc encourages its suppliers to adopt a similar approach

     customer service
     for creditgranting purposes risk analyses conducted on the borrower always take account of
     environmental risks partly because they could potentially have an adverse impact on the bor
     rowers activities and consequently on his repayment capacity and collateral
     accordingly wherever possible the bank checks whether the borrower complies with envi
     ronmental legislation and to this end devotes the requisite attention to environmental issues in
     training its personnel
     by organizing seminars on environmental performance for companies whether in collabora
     tion with argus or external partners it helps its business customers to control their environ

mental risks argus also provides ﬁrstline information on environmental problems to kbc
branches or directly to individual companies
via kbc asset management kbc also offers a range of sustainable investment funds suitable
for the entire range of risk proﬁles an inhouse research unit conducts sustainability screening
on a number of countries and companies and much of this involves examining various envi
ronmental aspects the outcome of this screening is made public
in the ﬁeld of insurance kbc puts its environmental policy into practice by devoting attention     39
to environmental aspects of policies creating speciﬁc environmental insurance and seeking to
prevent environmental incidents being caused by the persons it insures

objectives and responsibilities
environmental performance systems
kbc seeks to continuously apply its environmental policy and consequently plans to develop
and implement in stages an environmental management system that will entail analysing the
main environmental effects setting and updating targets and formulating implementing and
following up action plans with a view to enhancing kbcs environmental performance on a
continuous basis
any potentially adverse effects on the environment will be detected proactively and as quickly
as possible so that they can be avoided or minimized
each year environmental targets and corresponding environmental programmes are formu
latedreviewed by divisions whose activities have a direct environmental impact

follow up and audit
to facilitate the achievement of the objectives appropriate procedures and systems have
been developed and put in place performance with regard to meeting the annual objectives
is reported and monitored via the balanced score cards of those directorates that have direct
environmental responsibilities

internal reports
only through the active participation of employees is sustainable development possible
to facilitate the achievement of the companys objectives a broad platform has been es
tablished which encompasses all those concerned either directly facility management and
personnel or indirectly all group companies users employees this platform is used to
provide information solicit cooperation and provide an opportunity for dialogue with a view
to obtaining fresh input

external reports
kbc devotes a speciﬁc section in its annual report to its environmental performance it ensures
that correct information is provided to all stakeholders including information on its environ
mental impact and conservation efforts

     moreover in 2004 and again in 2005 kbc signed the west flanders environmental charter
     for all of its 179 branches in that province the charter is an initiative of gom westvlaanderen
                                      the west flanders regional development authority bvqi a cer
                                      tiﬁcation agency and charter zuidwestvlaanderen and brings
                                      together companies which voluntarily subscribe to environmental
                                      principles and objectives endorsement of this charter implies not
                                      only that kbc is complying with the environmental legislation in
                                      force but that kbc also seeks to continually improve its environ
                                      mental performance and to take action on a number of environ
                                      mental issues each year an evaluation commission carries out an
40   audit of each of the charter signatories to check their progress on the environmental front cf
     httpwwwgomwvlbenedmilieumcharterhtm

     in the area of procurement kbc has introduced a sustainability clause in its contracts with
     thirdparty suppliers and contract work pertaining to property thereby ensuring the use of
     environmentallyfriendly products

     kbc has been actively managing various projects in its belgian operations for rational energy
     consumption the purchase of green power the selective collection of hazardous waste and
     the reduction of paper consumption kbc succeeded for example in cutting the quantity of
     printed advertising material by 50 in 2004 in the ﬁnal quarter of 2004 kbc bank launched its
     waste management project the initial stage of this project will focus on identifying and inven
     torying all waste produced with a view to optimizing the entire waste process and harnessing
     hitherto unexploited synergy waste management efforts are not however conﬁned to belgium
     in the czech republic for example kbc group is already pursuing a selective waste manage
     ment policy in all its bank ofﬁces and branches in addition it has installed a system to measure
     the consumption of electricity in larger buildings and modern lowenergy technology is gradu
     ally being introduced

     based on the environmental policy statement kbc has developed a policy which focuses on
     maximizing customer friendliness and at the same time minimizing the burden of business travel
     on the environment kbc encourages its staff to opt for alternative commuter arrangements such
     as carpooling public transport and bicycle to that end a comprehensive uptodate carpool
     ing database has been developed to ensure a good match between carpoolers and place of
     domicile commuters using public transport are reimbursed for their periodic subscriptions and
     separate bicycle stalls and locker roomsshowers have been built for bicycle users kbc has also
     piloted a system of localized work stations as part of an effort to reduce commuting distance to
     ofﬁce locations moreover to cut back on excessive business travel video conferencing facilities
     have been set up in the head ofﬁces

     the table on p 41 is based on that provided in vfu indicators 2005 internal environmental

     indicator 1 internal energy consumption and
     indicator 6a greenhouse gas emissions
     indicator 1 covers the overall amount of energy used within kbcs buildings not included is the
     fuel consumption for business travel which is covered by indicator 2a business travel
     electricity consumption indicator 1a is broken down according to the suppliers used by kbc
     electrabel and nuon the latter provides green power  100 carbonneutral as well as con
     ventional grey power
     the dedicated choice of renewable energy has a positive effect on greenhouse gas emissions
     ghg indicator 6a

42   as most kbc buildings are new any major efforts to improve the power systems would be dif
     ﬁcult because the present installations are already performing as they should be
     most of the gains to be made have already been reaped ie good housekeeping actions have
     already been implemented under the current operational conditions present comfort levels
     business hours etc the overall energy consumption will continue to be at the same level

     kbc pursues a deliberate strategy of optimizing employee productivity and satisfaction by provid
     ing an optimal inhouse comfort level for employees and visitors alike any clear improvement in
     kbcs energy performance will be impossible without affecting this inhouse comfort level which
     maywill have repercussions on job satisfaction and productivity

     indicator 2 total business travel
     this indicator covers business trips undertaken by the companys employees travel undertaken by
     clients and suppliers are not included

     road travel is deﬁned as business trips undertaken in leased business or private cars document
     ed by kilometre

     indicator 3 total paper consumption
     total paper consumption is deﬁned as the amount of paper ordered by the various group entities

     the following categories make up the largest share of paper used
      ofﬁce paper multifunctional paper for copying and printing
      letterheadpreprinted forms
      envelopes
      continuous paper forms account statements for clients etc
      marketing material and publications internal and external

     indicator 3a concerns recycled paper this includes only paper which is 100 recycled post
     consumer waste

     indicators 3b and 3c both represent newﬁbretype paper here the issue which is environmen
     tally relevant is whether the paper is still bleached using elementary chlorine indicator 3c or
     whether a more ecologically friendly technology is employed indicator 3b kbc bans the use of
     chlorinebleached paper and purchases ecftcf paper with 18 fsc ﬁbres




     most paper types and volumes are purchased centrally the data available covers kbc group in
     belgium including the tied but independent commercial agencies of kbc insurance and centea

as a result the number of ftes covered here is higher when compared to other indicators

paper consumption at kbc is low on account of a successful campaign to reduce paper use in 3
years paper consumption declined by 30 eg due to the consistent use of doublesided print
ers and copiers

indicator 4 total water consumption
kbcs water supply constitutes mainly drinking water some local branches use rain water for the
purpose of toilet ﬂushing and irrigation of external areas
reliable data is available for water supply at kbcs main administrative buildings no data is avail
able regarding the use of rain water                                                                   43
estimating the water volume used based on ﬁnancial data is impossible because of signiﬁcant
differences between the prices charged in the various regionscities covered for this reason only
data based on meter readings are taken into consideration

indicator 5 waste
the waste indicator covers the total amount of waste produced by kbc the following
waste categories are included in indicator 5
 papercardboard
 residual wastedomestictype waste
 specialhazardous waste
 electronic scrap

the following waste categories are not included

 waste from construction and building remodelling

separate collection of paper and cardboard is common practice in belgium toners and car
tridges are also collected for recycling municipal waste and some toxicdangerous waste ﬂows are
incinerated only a small amount can be disposed of in landﬁlls
most obsolete ict hardware is channelled for use in schools and other social projects

aspiring to be a good neighbour
kbcs approach towards community engagement focuses on helping to alleviate poverty and
social disadvantage in this regard in belgium kbc supports initiatives for community building
selfhelp groups involved in the restoration of the urban social fabric and the integration of the
disadvantaged and immigrants by means of cooperation with local community centres and other
social associations such actions are not intentionally aimed at raising kbcs visibility or ﬁnancial
preeminence these projects which are designed to promote social integration are targeted
particularly at the poorer neighbourhoods in which kbc is signiﬁcantly present in brussels and
antwerp

kbc takes a longterm proactive approach with regard to smallscale schemes which are
frequently managed on a volunteer basis by social workers for example at kbcs head ofﬁce
in brussels collaborative efforts have been set up with neighbourhood organizations such as
bonnevie a community centre to lower the threshold between the company and the surround
ing environment and raise staff awareness about the neighbourhood

in antwerp kbc has been a patron of rataplan since its inception rataplan is a notforproﬁt
association involved in restoring the romazaal a protected art deco hall and promoting cultural
events in the heart of an ethnically mixed backward neighbourhood as a way to revive the com
munity
what is the rationale behind these efforts kbc wants to demonstrate its concern towards the
community in which it operates by actively taking part in improving the area via open dialogue
and nurturing awareness and a feeling of responsibility in its employees including in new re
cruits

social sponsorship
with respect to social sponsorship in belgium kbc has set its eyes on health care with an
emphasis on the prevention aspect noncommercial imagebuilding campaigns have been de
signed in this regard the projects selected such as levenslijn a charity that organizes fundrais

     ing campaigns for various healthcarerelated issues and kom op tegen kanker the anticancer
     campaign not only reﬂect kbcs community commitment but also put into practice the slogan
     putting people ﬁrst

     kbc entered into a multiyear contract with levenslijn on the theme of road travel ie increasing
     road safety for children and providing relief for child trafﬁc victims kbc has heightened public
     awareness in this area by helping to sell socalled levenslijn stars at its bank branches

     as for kom op tegen kanker kbc has supported this yearly fundraising campaign since its
     launch kbc is actively involved throughout the campaign starting from the opening show and

     assisting children hospitalized for a long period in communicating with their parents and class
     mates and de sleutel helping children to become assertive and selfconﬁdent as a ﬁrst step
     towards drug prevention

     prevention  safety awareness
     kbc handles the theme of prevention from the insurance perspective as a societywide project
     prevention campaigns related to asset protection and consumer health care illustrate kbcs
     willingness to be accountable to society to that end kbc collaborates with solid respectable
     partners who contribute effectively to social wellbeing

     a key theme that kbc promotes as a ﬁrstclass insurer is road and travel safety kbc supports
     various initiatives with regard to raising awareness for road safety such as the vab flemish
     automobile association autohappening the trafﬁc academy organized by the gezinsbond
     flemish league of families bicycle helmet campaigns and the zeb zebra initiative road safety
     teaching aids for children on top of this kbc sponsors the annual veilig en milieuvriendelijk
     naar school campaign commute safely to school using environmentally friendly means at 400
     elementary schools throughout flanders in close cooperation with parents teachers and the
     police in future kbc plans to focus more on road safety in collaboration with the vab by tak
     ing a more structured approach to driving classes and driving simulators with particular regard
     towards elderly motorists

     another theme concerns ﬁre and burn prevention in 2005 kbc is actively backing the ﬁre
     and burnprevention awareness week moreover kbc is a ﬁnancial sponsor of the belgische
     brandwondenstichting belgian burn foundation and supports the national burns camps vaca

     furthermore in a conscious effort to enhance safety on the belgian coast in the warmer months
     kbc has ﬁnanced socalled orientation poles on the beaches as well as armbands to help lost
     children ﬁnd their parents again

     volunteerism at kbc
     volunteerism is both healthy and vital in sustaining the society recent ﬁgures in flanders
     belgium show that one out of ﬁve flemings is actively involved in some kind of volunteer work
     to demonstrate its dedication to the values underlying volunteerism kbc has developed a criti
     cally acclaimed insurance policy which speciﬁcally covers volunteer workers

     on the other hand kbc also encourages voluntary work amongst its employees kbc expresses

its appreciation for and provides further incentives to employees involved in charitable deeds via
the solidarity fund aandacht voor anderen show attention to others employees who devote
their free time to organizations dedicated to care for the handicapped childcare home assist
ance thirdworld initiatives immigrant integration or neighbourhood improvement schemes are

thirty projects were supported in this way including the duikschool handi divers wet wheels a
diving school for the physically disabled and met lege handen a working group for parents who

appendix ii kbcs principles for socially responsible business

kbc aims through its activities to contribute to the economic social and ecological advancement
of the communities it serves accordingly it conducts its activities in compliance with both the
letter and the spirit of prevailing laws and regulations it also takes account of changing societal
norms norms which generally foreshadow subsequent legislation
for kbc a primary concern is to meet the needs and safeguard the interests of its customers
its shareholders its employees and the communities in which it operates in its dealings with
these stakeholders kbc observes principles of fairness reasonableness openness transparency
and discretion whilst ensuring privacy these principles are incorporated into a speciﬁc code of
conduct which governs all kbcs activities but especially its lending and asset management busi      59
nesses as well as its human resources and facility management projects
kbc bank has a social responsibility to meet its customers borrowing requirements at reason
able marketconform rates of interest which compensate it for the credit risk it takes and other
lendingrelated expenses before granting any credit kbc will conduct a preliminary analysis
not only of the associated purely ﬁnancial and economic aspects of the credit but also of the
relevant social and ecological aspects this analysis makes it possible among other things to
offer customers the credits and credit products that are best suited to their needs and ﬁnancial
resources
recommendations and decisions for asset management purposes are always formulated solely
with the customer in mind and in keeping with a general investment strategy that is based on a
thorough analysis of all available macroeconomic sectoral and company information as well as
the risk proﬁle of the customer concerned andor of the relevant investment products the cus
tomers risk proﬁle is determined with all due care in consultation with the customer and is ad
justed where necessary to take account of his or her changing ﬁnancial social and philosophical
position to ensure it can satisfy the broadest possible range of investment preferences the bank
develops investment products with diverse risk proﬁles and features including those that reﬂect
sustainable and ethical investment principles to support its investment policy in this regard kbc
asset management has set up its own research team to screen the sustainability of the policies
pursued by various companies and countries with a view to investing in government bonds kbc
asset management is assisted in this endeavour by an external advisory board the results of this
ethical screening are used by kbc asset management not only in the management of its ethical
funds but are to produce a semiannual publication available at httpwwwkbcambesustaina
bleinvestment

where insurance is concerned kbc will wherever the competitive room to manoeuvre allows
apply appropriate techniques to counter the moral hazard dilemma ie a tendency of persons
to exhibit riskier behaviour once insurance is taken out kbc will ensure that its products encour
age socially desirable or acceptable behaviour where risktaking is concerned

kbc is aware that in many cases particularly in the event of sickness disability or death money
cannot compensate for pain and suffering consequently it feels that it has a social duty to try
and preclude such pain and suffering where possible by means of an accidentprevention policy
in addition where needed kbc furnishes personal and professional assistance to accident vic
tims guiding them in their search for the best way to return to mental andor physical health

kbc will make an effort to include in certain products an explicit element of solidarity which
should make it possible to provide some measure of insurance for risks which would not normally
be insurable kbc is a ﬁrm believer in the principle that segmentation should not lead to discrimi
nation ie it should never lead to large groups of prospective policyholders being shut out on

     the basis of criteria they have no control over

     in its dealings with personnel kbc pursues an equal opportunity policy and resolutely avoids any
     form of discrimination the recruitment selection promotion and remuneration of its employees
     occurs on the basis of each individuals merits such as his or her knowledge and skill develop
     ment potential added value and the responsibilities he or she shoulders
     kbc aims to forge a lasting working relationship with its employees one characterized by balance
     between the individuals professional commitment which contributes to the companys capabili
     ties and his or her personal development in the broadest sense of the word

60   to achieve this aim
      kbc offers a competitive pay package providing employees with a fair pay for their work and
       their contribution to the companys results
      kbc seeks to be a caring employer even when problems arise
      kbc endeavours to enable employees to balance their professional and private lives and conse
       quently takes the requisite initiatives with regard to ﬂexible working arrangements employee
       mobility and social schemes
      kbc provides sound career guidance and topquality training so that employees are given
       adequate opportunities to further their careers and develop their skills
      kbc provides its employees with an attractive working environment and the necessary resourc
       es to be able to perform their job efﬁciently
      kbc seeks to employ people in its personnel department who provide prompt customer
       friendly and professional service

     kbc also aims to provide clear transparent information and considers good social dialogue as a
     basic building block in its corporate culture for this reason kbc promotes the efﬁcient and direct
     ﬂow of information throughout the organization via such tools as an intranet all this is intended
     to nurture and put into practice the values that kbc and its employees ﬁnd important these
     values are primarily openness and honesty in dealings with one another a mutual respect and
     collaboration on projects which is characterized by a spirit of helpfulness and professionalism

     kbc is aware that the rational use of natural resources  even for a serviceproviding informa
     tionprocessing enterprise  can help to alleviate the burden on the environment
     it will therefore ensure that its resources are as ecologically sound and used as rationally as possi
     ble whether this concerns water and energy use the consumption of products wasteprevention
     and processing or transportation
     kbc endorses sustainable building principles and in providing accommodation for its workforce
     takes account of any possible environmental impact this may have as well as of employee com
     fort and efﬁciency
     it will require its suppliers of products and services to adopt a similar approach based on full
     compliance with the relevant laws and the implementation of environmental conservation sys
     tems in keeping with the ecomanagement and audit scheme emas framework fairness will
     be a feature of all of kbcs dealings with its suppliers

     kbc makes a commitment to the communities in which it operates not only by funding social
     cultural or scientiﬁc initiatives but also by making competencies or facilities for instance avail
     able where needed in this way kbc aims not only to help enhance the prosperity of the com
     munities it serves but also to improve their wellbeing kbc encourages its employees to become
     socially involved

appendix iii equator principles

on 26 january 2004 kbc ofﬁcially adopted the equator principles a set of voluntary guidelines
developed to address environmental and social issues that may arise in ﬁnancing largescale
projects these guidelines are based on wellestablished ifc and world bank policies and guide
lines the adoption of the equator principles reinforces kbcs longstanding commitment to envi
ronmental and social responsibility in all its activities both domestically and internationally the
principles were launched by a number of banks in june 2003 today over 30 ﬁnancial institutions
have adopted the principles

applying the principles                                                                                                                         61
at kbc the equator principles apply equally to kbcs project ﬁnance business which is handled
by 40 professionals out of six centres dublin london brussels new york hong kong and
sydney and to the project ﬁnance units of its four main subsidiaries kh csob kredyt bank
and iib

by adopting these principles kbc seeks to ensure that the projects it ﬁnances are developed and
operated in a manner that is socially responsible and reﬂect sound environmental management
practices the focus is on transactions within the infrastructure energy power renewables and
oil  gas and telecommunication sectors as an equator bank kbc will not provide loans to
projects where the borrower will not or is unable to comply with kbcs environmental and social
policies and processes

kbc applies the equator principles to all of its project ﬁnance activities around the world that
entail transactions with a capital cost above 50 million usd in accordance with the parameters of
the equator principles the principles themselves do not need to be applied to transactions below
this threshold however kbc requires each loan ofﬁcer to analyse any such project with a high
level of social and environmental vigilance

kbc is usually involved in projectﬁnance transactions either as an arranging bank or as a mem
ber of a bank syndicate irrespective of the position of nonequator banks in the syndicate kbc
requires compliance with the principles kbc always sees to it that adherence to the equator
principles is included in any term sheet submitted to a borrower or project sponsor special atten
tion is also given to the loan documentation process in order to make sure that the appropriate
environmental and social clauses are incorporated when kbc appoints legal advisers we request
them to verify that the loan documentation requires the borrower to maintain compliance with
the environmental management plan emp and the reporting of any material breaches these are
standard terms and conditions for all our project ﬁnance transactions

implementation and training
today the equator principles are fully implemented at kbc speciﬁc equator principles procedures
have been developed and incorporated in the credit procedural manual to be applied to any
project exceeding 50 million usd it should be noted that such projects are initially categorized by
the project ﬁnance ofﬁcer as either a b or c and is then reviewed by the credit department38
the ﬁnal decision on the project category is taken by the credit committee moreover when kbc
works with an independent technical adviser we ensure that the scope of the advisers tasks

38 category a projects with signiﬁcant adverse environmental and social impacts which are sensitive diverse or unprecedented
   category b projects with less adverse environmental and social impacts which are sitespeciﬁc reversible and susceptible to mitigation
   category c projects with little or no environmental impact

     includes the requirement to provide us with expert assessment on environmental andor social
     considerations regarding the project including feedback with respect to the potential environ
     mental or social impacts the environmental management plan and overall compliance of the
     project with the equator principles the reasons for categorization are documented during this
     process in accordance with the parameters of the principles kbc always requires an environmen
     tal impact assessment to be drawn up for projects classiﬁed as a or b

     kbc has appointed a senior manager within the project finance department as coordinator
     responsible for all equator bank matters during the course of 2004 all project ﬁnance ofﬁcers
     were trained on how to apply the equator principles furthermore a wider group of executives
62   including credit ofﬁcers and relationship managers were briefed on the principles

     projects in 2004
     the table below provides the number and share of the transactions which were approved
     and concluded by kbc after adoption of the principles ie the period between february and
     december 2004

      2004 feb to dec                       number of transactions       as  of 2004 projectﬁnance
                                                                                         lending volume
      category a                                                      1                              3
      category b                                                      9                             65
      category c                                                      6                             32

     in the above table the a category project represents one transaction in the oil  gas sector the
     b category projects comprise projects in the energy mainly power plants and infrastructure
     sectors mainly toll roads in europe the c category projects represent the ﬁnancing of wind
     farms and projects within the infrastructure sector involving light construction works if the reﬁ
     nancings of existing assets involving no expansion or construction  which kbc categorizes as c
      were included in the above statistics the number of c projects would rise to 16
     the aggregate development cost of the above projects is approximately 13 billion euros exclud
     ing reﬁnancings

     although a number of transactions were rejected in 2004 none of these was primarily due to
     environmental or social concerns any transaction that does not meet or cannot be made to
     comply with the equator principles is turned down without ﬁrst being submitted for approval to
     the credit committee

     last but not least the environmental and social standards were improved in at least one project
     through the adoption of the equator principles
