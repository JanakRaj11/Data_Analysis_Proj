the group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes

the parent company operates defined benefit pension schemes covering 465 current employees and 151 pensioners the corresponding
figures for the group are 1431 and 240 respectively the schemes provide the right to defined future benefits

the new afp scheme is a defined benefit multientity scheme the companies covered by the lonho agreement have an actual financial
liability as a result of the agreement on the new afp scheme however there is insufficient information to facilitate inclusion of the liability
in the annual financial statements consequently no liability has been recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the new afp scheme

the parent company operates a pension scheme for 11 employees and 3 pensioners that is financed from the companys operations
