sega has been the cause for involving people in many
different movements due to our various amusement
machines in recent years we have produced a number of
different products that utilize networking this has created
new forms of play such as matches between stores and play
linked to mobile devices we have also been developing
machines and building business models that emphasize
investment efficiency for the amusement center operator
one of these is the game border break airburst
hereafter referred to as border break an online
competitive game that can handle up to 10 players on each of
two sides two years after going on sale this game is still
consistently popular and there always seems to be a line of
waiting players one notable feature is that the results of past
matches can be stored on a dedicated ic card so players can
be matched against online opponents at the same level
we talked with a development producer and a cabinet
designer about the dedication they have put into development
and about the attractions of a game that is packed with
various kinds of appeal including the introduction of a system
of timebased charges which is unusual in arcade games




the fun and the new value we wanted to provide through border break
  the appeal of an online competitive game that all our customers
  can take active part in and feel they have their own roles in
we gave border break diverse kinds of appeal for instance by enabling people to find users at their own level to play
against online and making it possible to customize parts to make original characters what we wanted them to enjoy
most of all was the fun of playing in teams against each other it is disappointing to lose when you play one against one
still if you played in a game of 1000 people against 1000 people you could lose sight of your own sense of
significance this is where playing two teams of 10 people against each other is so appealing because you can feel that
your own actions have made a difference when you win and it is the teams responsibility when you lose
there is another aspect apart from the unique appeal of the game itself we hoped that the arcade location would give
our customers something that being the individual roles people take on when they play in a team against another team
up to now games were the domain of those with skill but with border break players can have their own roles
and have fun doing something in areas they are good at everybody can enjoy it both people who are good at
games and those who are not either way we wanted people to have a stage in the game center on which they
could play their own roles that is where we find the appeal of team playing in an online game and i think this
is the way to go in new games which we were not able to do with the previous technology
this is what all of us on the development staff were dedicated to
accomplishing and it is a real joy to think that
this communicated to our customers and that
a lot of people are enjoying the game

                                                    the points that we were very particular about when designing the cabinet and that we gave consideration to were the level
                                                    of comfort and the durability of the controller one of the pleasures of this game is making the robot do whatever we wish
                                                       performing that kind of operation comfortably is made possible partly by the cabinet and the controller that is why if
                                                         these parts were to break or malfunction easily not only would they spoil the customers enjoyment but they would

                                                            durability tests we identified areas of wear through the tests and made repeated improvements to the parts and

 the club sega akihabara shinkan opened in february 2010 and we have been building the shop on the concept of providing
 entertainment for a wide range of customers even for the akihabara district where there are many core video game fans here we
 welcome everyone men and women alike from junior and senior high school students to foreign tourists
 we have set up special areas with air hockey print club ufo catcher and other such machines that can easily be played by
 groups and that are popular with women we also added a golden classic game area with games that sega fans from years past
 will also enjoy playing
 the most popular place in this shop is border break we were very particular
 about creating a space where people can play in teams of 10 against 10 which
 makes the most of this games distinctive features

 border break is the game for which maintenance is most important it requires a higher frequency
 of repair than other game machines and it demands thorough maintenance on an everyday basis
 that is because this game can be played by multiple players and if the game controller were to
 malfunction during a game that competition could never be
 recovered again in order to safeguard these important
 onetime match experiences for our customers daytoday
 maintenance is essential we also provide other detailed
 thoroughgoing services so that our customers can enjoy
 playing in comfort some of these are based on the views
 and requests we glean from our communication with
 customers for example we take care with the spacing of
 individual game machines and ways of guiding the human
 traffic flow among them install multiple monitors and take
 other steps so that people can enjoy watching other players
                                                                live action monitors set up according to our    maintenance of the lever parts is particularly important
 and take pointers from what they see                          communication with customers                    daytoday maintenance is essential

               as corporate citizens we will contribute to society not only by
               prospering in business but also by proactively supporting both the
               development of cultural activities including art and sport and the
               preservation of the global environment


               our stance
               as a good corporate citizen the group recognizes the need to
               tackle environmental issues in 2006 the group commissioned an
               external environmental research firm to assess the potential
               environmental impacts of its manufacturing processes products
               and services
               while it did not identify any serious environmental risks we
               nonetheless decided to undertake a range of measures to step up
               compliance with environmental laws and use resources and energy
               more efficiently we have taken steps to enlighten all employees
               about environmental issues so they can act accordingly in their
               private lives
               global environmental issues manifested as climate change and
               other chronic issues require an urgent response and it is critical for
               enterprises to keep voluntarily and proactively working to protect
               the environment
               the sega sammy group code of conduct mandates three things
               from our employees to ensure that business activities are conducted
               appropriately in consideration of the global environment we make
               sure each group employee understands how to help out as an
               individual as we work to protect the global environment



                                             code of conduct
                 global environment
                 ❶ we will consider the possible effects on the global environment stemming from all
                   elements of our products overall lifecycles ranging from material procurement
                   manufacturing distribution use recycling and disposal
                 ❷ to protect the global environment we will not only comply with related laws and various
                   regulations but will also actively and voluntarily consider and implement any further
                   measures we believe will benefit the global environment
                 ❸ we will nurture our personnel to be highly aware of the global environment and to strive
                   for material and energy conservation both personally and professionally

business activities have on the global environment and the need to protect that environment as a result our employees have
environmental awareness in their daily lives and can act on it                                                      before                                                    after
