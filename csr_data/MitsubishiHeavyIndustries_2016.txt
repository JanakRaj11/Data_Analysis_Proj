                                                          have been strengthened further

                                                          change continuously to be in step with the
                                                          changing demands society makes of companies
                                                          and their purpose at mhi we have a responsibility
                                                          to develop technologies critical to many industries
                                                          however as our business operations expand
  accountability is fundamental to                        globally we shoulder responsibilities that are
  good governance                                         increasing in breadth and complexity to fulfill these
                                                          responsibilities in a manner that befits a global
                                                          corporation we are putting into practice the 10
                                                          principles of the un global compact relating to
regarding risk response and business decisions the       human rights labor the environment and anti
functions of the board of directors meetings have         corruption above all i believe that the foundation of
changed considerably during the past few years           good governance exists in providing honest
previously discussions made prior to voting tended       sincere and convincing explanations of our
to be somewhat lacking in substance now more            business processes their results and their impact
time is allotted to actively explaining and debating      across the full spectrum of our stakeholders
management policy this includes our strategies our      including shareholders customers business
approach to given issues the criteria on which           partners affiliates and suppliers to achieve such
decisions have been reached our business status         good governance our aim is to solicit a wide range
objective analysis and so on what i would like is for   of opinions at board of directors meetings
our outside directors who serve in a supervisory         concerning the mhi groups role in society and
role along with our own members of the audit and         social values we will then share the views debated
supervisory committee to be informed of                  with all employees and convey this information to
managements views earlier on and to be able to           our external stakeholders these efforts toward
engage in dynamic discussions from a variety of           greater transparency will surely also lead to stronger
perspectives my hope is for discussions and              risk management
decisions of a more substantial nature and not mere
perfunctory proceedings                                  for details about mhis efforts to enhance transparency in

taking the right financial steps to support such initia   financial soundness even when we make major
tives among other measuresdetermines who will            shortterm opportunistic growth investments such
be tomorrows winners and losers this is especially       as ma risks are also expanding as we make more
true of mhi where we have a significant gap in busi      moves into overseas markets and increase large
ness scale compared with our overseas competi             scale businesses it is essential that we build a
tors we must hone our competitiveness using for          buffer against such risks
example differentiated strategies such as strength            to that end we will further accelerate the initia
ening our engineering base through the harmoniza          tives we have taken to date for example optimizing
tion of technologies                                      our business portfolio and improving our balance
      in the coming years i believe my foremost           sheets furthermore by undertaking asset manage
responsibility as cfo will be to consider how we can       ment and pursuing asset liquidation we will target a
secure funds for growth investments while simulta         cash flow of 200 billion within the framework of
neously strengthening our financial structure we          our 2015 mediumterm business plan through
estimate that the cash flow required for largescale       these measures i aim to increase our owners
investments in the mrj will peak out around fiscal         equity to 2 trillion build up a risk buffer and
2018 but even after then we intend to set aside           improve our financial soundness while preparing
some 20 of our total investment capital for new           flexibly to meet our increasing capital demands
businesses capable of becoming future pillars of           these activities will ready us for the great growth
growth in addition we have to build up a solid           opportunities that lie ahead
financial structure that will allow us to maintain



roe improvement
as explained above the mhi group today remains            words we must invest management resources
in a growth phase for that reason i believe we will      heavily into those businesses we expect to be highly
continue to increase our owners equity while secur       profitable while simultaneously cutting back on
ing seed money to pursue aggressive growth invest         resource investments in areas that offer meager
ments and build risk buffers at the same time i fully    profitability or involve more risk than is worth taking
recognize that enhancing our capital efficiency will             compared with our overseas competitors our
be indispensable to maximizing shareholder value          earning capacity lags sorely this is reflected in the
so in our 2015 mediumterm business plan we set            evaluations we receive from the market while our
a target of 102 for roe in fiscal 2017                  competitors have an aggregate market value
      in brief i believe that mhi is today at a stage     exceeding the scale of their net sales in our case
where we are simultaneously seeking to improve our         our aggregate market value is less than half of our
profitability and raise roe while building up our          scale of sales unless we improve our profitability
owners equity to achieve those aims it will be vital    we will be unable to compete on a level playing field
to concentrate on our core competencies in other          with our overseas competitors



dividend policy
during the period of the 2015 mediumterm                  substantially as a result of the losses booked against
business plan our intention is to carry out share        our cruise ship construction business but business
holder returns through a targeted consolidated divi       as a whole was able to sustain solid results based
dend payout ratio of 30 at the same time we will        on that assessment we paid out an annual dividend
