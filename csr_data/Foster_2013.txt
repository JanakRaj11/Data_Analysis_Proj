     ecofriendly products
     vocreduction speaker unit

       regarding ecofriendly product designing eﬀorts have been
     made through reconsideration of structures and materials to
     develop technology that enables adhesivefree bonding for
     processes which had previously been adhesivedependent
       freedom from adhesives brings for th merits such as
     reduction of voc  development and manhours for speaker
     assembling
      volatile organic compounds



     lightweight speaker unit for vehicles

        the foster group succeeded in development of lightweight
     speaker units for the electric vehicles that are viewed as the next
     generation of ecofriendly transportation with a rare earthfree
     16cm diameter speaker weighing as light as only 240g we have
     maintained suppression of the decrease in the sound pressure
     level
       in addition we succeeded in further reducing the weight by 10
     percent which also contributes to a reduction in co2 emissions
       its frame is made of a special pp material we accomplished
     this production by minimum usage of materials while maintaining
     stability via optimum design
       the foster group uses adhesives that do not contain harmful
     solvents which leads to a reduction of total voc for the comfort
     in passenger cabins of vehicles
        diaphragms and center caps which are also waterproof for
     vehicle use are made of recyclable paper



     headphones and head set

       the foster group actively feeds back its ecofriendliness
     policy in product and process design in consideration of the
     needs to reduce environmentally hazardous substances in
     every product in observance of the most updated country
     specific legal requirements and rohs2 it is our normal
     practice to submit proposals to customers and proceed
     spreading laterally to other locations energy management
     minimization of waste adoption of compact molds and
     recycling material through factory facilities are moving ahead
     we also produce diaphragms and housings made from
     biochemical materials
