       in our management policies of becoming a globally competitive and trusted financial services group furthermore we
       properly reflect needs of our clients and society in our csr activities
       completely and fully achieving csr is truly the management itself and we also believe that seriously committing to the
       implementation of csr is thought to be the shortest path for achieving our management policies and goals

       support programs at all group companies specifically we                                 show that the birthrate is highest in countries where
       have introduced at all group companies frameworks for                                     more women are in work with the number of people

       we also have systems for paying subsidies for nurseries                                   an increase in the number of women aged between
       and for reemployment of employees who have left for                                      20 and around 40 going to workthat is the middle

       at the same time in external activities under the smbc                                  women balance this with the demands of pregnancy
       pro bono project launched in summer 2012 we have                                         childbearing and childrearing is a major issue
       given advice in areas such as operational administration                                  the direct reason for the decline in the birthrate is said to
       and management of donations to three groups seeking                                       be the rise in the number of people marrying late or not
       designated nonprofit organization status in the area of                                  marrying at all i think there are various underlying reasons
       support for childraising that is ultimately related to                                  for this in questionnaires and other surveys the cost of
       approaches for supporting organizations and groups                                        childraising and education in money terms tops the list
       involved in supporting child                                                             but i am not certain this is the real issue rather i wonder

       we also provide funding                                                                   female participation in the labor force by age group
       support through the smbc
       volunteer fund in which
       around 12000 employees
       of the company participate
       despite the progress in
       these activities though
       we feel that the current
       level of activities is not yet
       systematic enough and that
       this is an issue for the future



         ending the isolation of mothers and children

       ogawa at smfg the question has been raised of what
       would be the best way to go about externallyoriented
       activities relating to support for childraising what kind
       of problems have arisen in the environment surrounding
       childraising at the moment and what issues                                             sources

       minutes a day on household matters and in childraising                                  i do think it is necessary to enable regional communities
       less than half the oecd the average of 131 minutes their                                 to have mechanisms available for supporting childraising
       involvement in childraising is minimal another issue is the                             in systemic terms japan devotes an extremely low level
       dilution of regional communities when you do not know                                    of expenditure as a proportion of gdp to children and
       who is living nextdoor and when you just go straight to                                 childraising households compared with many foreign
       the convenience store to get daily problems sorted out i                                 countries i believe that is connected with the lack of
       think this in combination with social change means that                                 childraising facilities and their low quality in light of
       opportunities for people to meet each other are declining                                these problems i believe it is vital to foster nonprofit
       and this social isolation is connected with the serious                                   organizations that can support childraising so as to create
       problems in childraising schoolchildren are suffering                                   regional communities where childraising is facilitated
       stress there is increasing violence on school premises and                              even though mechanisms do exist for care of the aged in
       bullying and truancy have become issues i see two reasons                                japan care insurance equivalent mechanisms for children
       for stress in schoolchildren one is that they get less play                              are still underdeveloped given these circumstances
       time and experience of naturethe traditional environment                                japan is set to create a new system by fiscal 2015 i want
       for childraising has receded with social change also                                                                       to hear more people

       closed down for funding reasons some schools stop their                                                                      including companies

       shortage of childcare facilities for schoolchildren for which                                                                things so that functioning
       the need has grown in recent years and there has been                                                                        mechanisms can be

       another problem is the fact that children have
       increasingly limited ranges of human contact they only
       really have access to their school teachers parents
       and classmates and do not have the opportunity
       for having contact with children of different ages
       adults and other people with different values
       there are many issues but i think the biggest is a lack

       in the eu is 70 and the north european countries                                        that the urgency of the

       likewise in sweden the rate of enrolment in childcare                                   of this problem are not

       impressive 94 for children aged three years or more                                     i wonder if the issue of
       in sweden too childraising was traditionally viewed as                                  women participating in the workforce and the problem of
       a womans task but since the government introduced a                                     the declining birthrate are not the primary issues we need

       not easily be entrusted to outside carers due to the lack                                 york has become a place where children are treated

       tying women to the home and the baby boom but as a                                       environment for children is extremely cold i will
       result of legislation that shifts the burden of responsibility                            look now at why japan has become like this

       ill the fact that working parents can take 120 days per year

       over the last 30 years the initiatives taken by companies                                   the ability of an enterprise to influence

       okuyama i consider the                                                                    the educational frontline by supporting childraising at

       example i think there are                                                                raising support and could develop financial products that
       examples of corporations                                                                  could be used for supporting children and childraising
       leading the way in creating                                                               by committing a portion of their investment earnings to
       the international standard under which passengers with                                    orphanages and poorer families furthermore with an
       children are given priority in boarding planes so what                                   increasing number of businesses getting involved in support
       can financial institutions do in this area we need to                                    for childcare and childraising wouldnt it be a good idea
       think about what approaches banks can take to enable                                      if there was some kind of mechanism that made possible
       diversity of families in terms of making it easier to make                                evaluation of such companies in this respect through our
       loans on specific terms to foreigners and single mothers                                  core business to ensure the sound development of this
       from the point of view of the bank users if they are able                                sector for creation of a sustainable society the falling
       to repay loans on schedule in addition to publicizing a                                  birthrate needs to be considered alongside environmental
       family policy as part of csr initiatives looking at it from                            problems i think we as a company should be able to apply
       a npo viewpoint it seems that companies have not yet                                     here the same tools that we use for environmental issues
       successfully drawn attention to the activities on behalf of                               takami the smfg group is involved in an impressive
       the community that they are involved in i think we need to                               range of activities but there is an impression of deficiency
       go about things more positively and gradually publicize our                              when it comes to external dialogue for example would
       initiatives in areas such as help for the childraising support                           it not be possible to promote public relations jointly
       organizations mentioned in the introductory comments                                     by creating a group of leading companies or engage in
       yanagisawa taking the position of childrens                                              activities in partnership with npos to shape public opinion
       spokesperson who is a pediatrician i believe society                                     okuyama as an approach to involvement in shaping
       as a whole needs to think more seriously about                                            public opinion i see great potential for exerting
       education of children in whose hands our future                                           influence by showing social commitment by spreading
       prosperity will rest so for the sake of children                                        awareness of the falling birthrate describing in detail
       and families we should invest aggressively in state                                      our activities and laying out our aims for the future
       agencies local authorities and companies
       it is also necessary to mitigate abuse of children
       through support for childraising in all areas of public
       life from the perspective of a medical professional i
       see clear linkage between the advanced age at which
       women are having birth and the low birth weight of
       children which raises the risk of diseases associated
       with unhealthy adult lifestyles i think companies
       should think about doing more to enable employees to
       marry at an early age and advance their careers while
       getting pregnant and having and raising children
       ikemoto i see three things that companies can do first
       we have been talking about measures to deal with the
       shortage of childcare facilities and setting up such facilities
       within companies if you look at it from the viewpoint of a
       child you see that commuting becomes a burden there
       have been moves recently by companies to use their own
       premises to set up community childcare facilities some
       companies that originally intended to create childcare
       facilities inhouse have also opened up approved childcare
       facilities to people in the local community the second

         giving shape to problem awareness and
         supporting childraising
       kubo it may be true that smfg has not effectively
       publicized the range of initiatives that it is undertaking
       but if you consider our ability to influence society as
       both a bank and as a financial group i think it is possible
       that smfg could exert a beneficial influence through
       its proactive support for childraising in the group csr
       report measures to deal with environmental problems
       form one enormously important theme likewise i think
       that our loan products with environmental assessment
       conditions attached are highly regarded by the public
       but i do have a feeling that so far by comparison the
       various measures that we have undertaken to deal with
       the declining birthrate and support childraising have fallen
       short recently somebody said there were similarities
       between childrearing and environmental issues i feel that
       our starting point must be doing what we can do including
       the soft power we exert as a bank at the management
       level there is a strong awareness of the problem of the
       declining birthrate but within the company it is sometimes
       difficult to feel that that awareness is shared we have
       created inhouse mechanisms for promoting a better
       worklife balance but i do not think you would necessarily
       say that usage is at acceptable levels i think we need to
       continue with efforts to promote a shared awareness of the
       issues within the company and then externally publicize
       ideas even just one or two if they are realized in practice
       nakamura today we have listened to a range of
       opinions and we have heard suggestions from various
       viewpoints for this i would like to express my thanks
       our experts have given a clear idea of the importance
       of our mission of developing wideranging products
       and services related to these issues publicizing them
       in the outside world and ensuring they are understood
       in depth within the company this has renewed
       smfgs determination to contribute to resolution of
       major social issues such as the declining birthrate

       east japan earthquake the environment japans declining                                 complacency in this context i would like to see the smfg group

       priority issues that it needs to address of these priority issues                       and to engage aggressively in a wide range of activities
       i believe that smfg holds as paramount the environment in
       this regard i can see that the company has made significant                                  globalization
       strides in the three pillars of its environmental action reduction
       of impacts on environment management of environmental                                    the third version of the equator principles which comply

          japan earthquake                                                                       is a significant expansion on the second version of the equator

       the great east japan earthquake wreaked its havoc it will                                guiding principles regarding business and human rights found
       take a considerable amount of time before a full recovery is                              in multiple international documents i am convinced that
       completed smfg continues to provide reconstruction support                               the importance placed on participation in human rights due
       to the areas affected by the earthquake through a variety                                 diligence workshops in these guiding principles is a major
       of social contribution activities including a framework that                              step forward in addressing the issue of global human rights
       enables employees to take special leave for volunteer activities                          i would therefore like to see the smfg group as a whole
       in collaboration with npos and by taking full advantage of                                as well as smbc which has adopted the equator principles
       the core businesses of group companies the fact that the                                 upgrade and expand its csr activities on a global scale
       group has adopted a limited but longterm approach toward
       its reconstruction efforts in line with opinions raised during a                              in conclusion
       dialogue with stakeholders during the previous fiscal year is to
       be highly commended i look forward to the group pursuing                                 the fact that smfg has received various awards for its csr
       its social contribution activities in tune with the everchanging                         and sustainability efforts is to be highly commended
       needs of each affected area and hope that individual group                                recognizing that there can often be a gap between the
