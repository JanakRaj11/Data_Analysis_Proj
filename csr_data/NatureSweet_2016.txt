message from our ceo
     on behalf of our more than 7500 associates at naturesweet
     welcome to our eighth annual naturesweet social responsibility
     and sustainability report

     one of the most significant trends in north american society is
     the issue of trust today when asked the question do you
     trust the brands you buy more consumers than ever before
     are answering no

     at naturesweet we believe trust has three elements vulnerability
     commitment and communication at the heart of earning trust
     is vulnerability vulnerability means if naturesweet is going to be
     so bold as to request your trust we need to have the courage
     to ask others how we perform vulnerability means we will have a
     thirdparty firm evaluate our performance and tell us where we
     need to improve

     however vulnerability is not enough for naturesweet earning
     trust means making a commitment to change commitment to
     change means we will agree on what is excellent performance
     with specific actions to achieve our commitments

     finally to earn your trust we will communicate our performance
     against our commitments through this report and through social
     media i invite you to learn more about naturesweet throughout
     the year at our website wwwnaturesweetcom

     if you have any comments or questions regarding our social
     responsibility and sustainability report or our website i invite you
     to email me directly at bambelangnaturesweetcom i look forward
     to hearing from you

     sincerely

is abundant to strengthen associates skills and confidence we provide a range
of training and education  from workplace skills and safety sessions to improved
literacy and personal development

on respect for the individual and the value of teamwork in this leadership model
naturesweet has replaced the traditional approach of one leader directing
subordinates with a collaborative approach leaders are encouraged to empower
teams to find solutions and to continuously improve their work together


       learning from others
       since the beginning of my work with this company i have
       been lucky enough to have very professional colleagues willing
       to share their knowledge with me i consider it a personal
       achievement to be able to share my knowledge with my team

temporary associates
to meet seasonal production demands naturesweet employs temporary associates
who work with us on contract and receive wages and benefits comparable to our
fulltime associates as valued members of our teams we require all temporary
associates be treated with the same respect and integrity as our fulltime associates
and that they have the opportunity to pursue fulltime work with naturesweet in 2015
temporary associates represented nearly 23 of our total workforce

recruitment
in 2015 naturesweet hired 1500 associates from among our temporary associates
which is reflective of our commitment to providing fulltime employment to associates
who might otherwise be working in seasonal migratory positions that provide less
stability for themselves and their families

three years  with women representing 31 of our workforce in 2015 in comparison to
30 in 2014 and 28 in 2013 women represented 30 of new hires in mexico and 35

     water meters at each greenhouse location         zapotlán                      11
     these new water meters allow us to
     better understand how and where
     water is used  whether for irrigation in
     greenhouses washing tomatoes in our            total water use
     packing areas or elsewhere such as in          overall naturesweets total use of water
     kitchens and restrooms                         in 2015 increased by 138 at all of our
                                                     facilities additionally our use of water
     thanks to this work naturesweet was            per pound of production increased from
     able to track 934 of all water used in        0050 m3pound in 2014 to 0056 m3
     2015 compared to just 72 in 2014 this         pound in 2015 several factors contributed
     more complete usage data will be used           to this increased water use including
     to identify and develop new ways to use         growing new varieties of tomatoes as well
     water more efficiently                         as implementing new irrigation techniques
                                                     that are ideal for growing healthy tomato
     water recycling                                 plants and allow us to better control
     water recycling systems were in use at          fertilizer use the results are paying
     three greenhouse locations in three of          off in our tomato production but have
     our facilities in 2015 with these systems     contributed to increased water
     we were able to reuse approximately             use in 2015
     251760 cubic meters approximately
     665 million gallons of water used in our      our increased water use was also driven
     greenhouses this system also allows us         by a 31 increase in our arizona facilities
     to reuse fertilizers that were not originally   where less water was reused than in
     absorbed by the tomato plants and that          previous years due to the new irrigation
     would otherwise go unused this results         techniques being implemented
     in positive environmental impact and
     economic savings for naturesweet

waste management and recycling

management of waste at each of our facilities       organic waste and composting
is an essential part of naturesweets longterm     the amount of organic product waste
sustainability plan including naturesweets        at naturesweet continues to decline
commitment to recycling and composting             significantly as naturesweet better
                                                    manages our growing seasons to meet

waste waste sold to third parties for recycling   that did not make it grocery store shelves
and other inorganic waste this was driven          was down 30
by an increase in waste at our zapotlán
greenhouses as well as a decision to discard a      naturesweet is implementing new
quantity of outdated packaging at our willcox       composting initiatives at our greenhouse
facility which will be recycled in 2016           facilities our longterm goal is to put in
                                                    place composting best practices at each
recycling                                           of our greenhouse locations in 2015 we

                                                    since 2014 naturesweet has used
in 2015 the main barrier to selling recyclable     recycled pet plastic for 100 of our
materials was the lack of certified recycling       product packaging with that initiative
businesses in the communities near our              completed we have now turned our
mexico greenhouses for this reason                attention to the cardboard boxes used
naturesweet has worked with local                   to ship our tomatoes in 2015 we began
communities near our greenhouses to help            tracking the total amount of recycled
establish six certified recycling businesses that   corrugated cardboard used 39 versus
will provide needed services to naturesweet         our use of virgin cardboard 61
and will help strengthen the communities
where we operate




           naturesweet uses recycled pet
           plastic for 100 of our product
           packaging now the focus will
           shift to the cardboard boxes used
           for shipping our tomatoes

energy and greenhouse gas emissions

naturesweets overall energy consumption fell 104 primarily due to the reduction in natural
gas use after the closure of our greenhouses in snowflake arizona natural gas used to heat
water to warm greenhouses represents 96 of all fuels used at naturesweet

the use of other fuels 4 of all fuel use increased and includes gasoline diesel and liquid
petroleum gas lpg used for generators vehicles and other purposes such as cooking
meals in our kitchens for our growing team of associates this increased use is due to the
inclusion of arizona data which had not been measured in 2014
                                                     fuel use

increased by 10 per 1000 pounds of
tomatoes produced this increase is due
in part to naturesweets new irrigation                total fuel                    119
techniques which require additional
electricity to operate the irrigation                  natural gas                   127

in arizona was significantly higher than
in mexico in willcox our electricity                 diesel                         52
consumption was more than three times
the average use in our mexico facilities              gasoline                      195
more work is needed to analyze the

greenhouse gas emissions                             refrigerants
in 2015 naturesweets total greenhouse              replacing 67 air conditioning systems in
gas emissions which include direct and all          2015 has resulted in a 33 decrease use
indirect emissions decreased by 209               of r22 refrigerant gas at naturesweet
per pound of production naturesweets               facilities a significant reduction in the use of
direct greenhouse gas emissions which               this ozonedepleting gas looking ahead to

fertilizers declined by 151 overall or a 157   of r22 at all of our greenhouses and offices
decrease per pound of tomatoes produced
the decline in natural gas usage resulting
from the closure of the snowflake plant is
a major reason for this overall decrease in
emissions indirect emissions from electricity
consumption increased by 17 overall or a
1 increase per pound of production other
indirect emissions from transporting our
products to packaging distribution centers
and retail locations as well as associate
transportation and flights declined 412
overall or a 416 decrease per pound
of production

     pesticides herbicides and fertilizers

     naturesweet only uses pesticides and
                                                          agrochemicals use
     herbicides approved by regulatory agencies
     in the united states and mexico which help              agrochemicals               usage
     control pests that can damage tomatoes
     and fertilizers that help us ensure our tomato          total

     produced when compared to 2014 this is                 soil sterilizers
     due in part to the increased use of cocopeat
     planting strips which are new in many of               other
     our greenhouses but that will provide                  pesticides                    37
     longterm benefits to the productivity of
     our tomato plants

     naturesweet no longer uses methyl
     bromide which is a soil sterilizer
     this has led our associates who are experts
     in managing plant health to shift to other
     less harmful chemicals to control pests and
     plant diseases

     fertilizers
     overall use of fertilizers by naturesweet declined 17 per pound of tomatoes produced
     these reductions are due to closing of our greenhouses in snowflake arizona and the
     production of organic products that do not require the use of fertilizers


     looking ahead

     with our focus on continuous improvement driven by our empowered associates we are
     confident that overall production efficiency will increase as our business grows this will in
     turn help manage and mitigate naturesweets environmental impact we look forward to
     sharing our continued progress in future reports
