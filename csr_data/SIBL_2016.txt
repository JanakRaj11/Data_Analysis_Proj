       by bangladesh bank differ with those of bfrs the requirement of the bank companies act 1991 and provisions and
       circulars issued by bangladesh bank shall prevail material and partial departures from the requirements of bfrs as well
       as the compliance with the bangladesh bank circulars are as follows

i     investment in shares and securities

       the bank investment in different securities has been valued on 31122015 as under

       quoted bond  shares                         at cost or market value whichever is lower
       unquoted shares                              at cost
       bangladesh govt islamic bond                at cost
       cdbl share  preference share                at cost

       all investment in securities are initially recognized at cost including acquisition charges associated with the investment
       premiums are amortised and discounts are accredited

       as per brpd circular no 15 09 november 2009 investments in quoted shares and unquoted shares are revalued at
       the year end at market price and as per book value of last audited balance sheet respectively provision should be made
       for any loss arising from diminution in value of investment as such the company measures and recognizes investment in
       quoted and unquoted shares at cost if the yearend market value for quoted shares and book value for unquoted shares
       are higher than the cost however as per requirements of bangladesh accounting standard bas 39 investment in
       shares falls either under at fair value through profit and loss account or under available for sale where any change
       in the fair value at the yearend is taken to profit and loss account or revaluation reserve respectively sibl recognises its
       investment in shares and securities as per bas39 and accounted for the required profitloss after adjustment of the
       value of shares and securities through profit and loss account

       derivatives

       typical examples of derivatives are futures and forward swap and option contracts as a shariah based islami bank sibl
       can not take part in issuing or purchasing any derivatives

ii    revaluation gainslosses on government securities

       sibl is a bank running on islamic shariah principle hence we do not participate in buying interest bearing government securities
                                                                                                                                                 financial statements



iii   investments and provisions

       as per bas39 impairmrnt assessment should be done by considering whether any objective evidence of impairment exists
       for financial assets that are individually significant for financial assets thet are not individually significant the assessment
       can be performed on an individual or collective portfolio basis

       however provision for classified and unclassified investment is made on the basis of year end review by the management
       and of instructions contained in bangladesh bank bcd circular no34 dated 16 november 1989 bcd circular no20 27
