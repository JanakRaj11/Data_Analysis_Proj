circular economy
inspired by nature where all cycles
are closed and all elements are
reused at the end of their useful
life in 2014 we created                     thus knowing in detail that cycle
natgenius a new operation that              the company has the opportunity
uses decades of reverse logistics             to implement improvements to
expertise of our compressors in               mitigate its negative impacts and
brazil to create a new business              boost its value creation

at the end of 2015 natgenius
was already operating in two units
with 80 employees dismantling
and recycling components not only



                                              24

manufacturers

in all since 2014 there have
already been recycled 13 million
compressors reusing 47
