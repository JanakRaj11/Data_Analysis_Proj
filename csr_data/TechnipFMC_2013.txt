how would you sum up the year 2012
as we look back to 2012 we see another year of good performance and great achievement and progress we have improved certain
safety indicators and for the first time since 2005 there were no fatalities on any of our projects we won a broad range of projects
across all our business leveraging our technologies and teams which translated into a record backlog as a result of the growth this
year we now have 36500 people working for technip worldwide this is 50 more than five years ago
we have also done a number of strategic moves over the course of 2012 i would like to highlight two of them the first one is the
acquisition of stone  webster process technologies which expands our downstream technology portfolio and gives us exposure
to the us petrochemicals market driven by the shale gas revolution in north america the second one is our commercial alliance
with heerema for the ultradeep subsea market
in parallel we invested 519 million in capex to strengthen our asset base in brazil for instance we are building a new flexible pipe
plant which will manufacture highend products for the 3000meter water depth presalt market

can you comment on technips financial results
2012 has again been a year of growth and profitability with technip delivering a strong performance in line with our
objectives
firstly i would like to note that our fullyear revenues have increased by 20 to 82 billion secondly our
operating margin is at 10 for the fourth year in a row with operating income growing by 16 to more than
800 million and lastly our backlog reached 143 billion at the end of 2012 with a strong order intake of
12 billion that represents an average of 1 billion per month it is a welldiversified backlog by geography
market segment and project type which we hold to be a critical success factor in our industry
our two segments of activities performed well in subsea the operating margin in 2012 was in line with our
objective at 15 on revenues which grew well ahead of plan at 36 in onshoreoffshore the operating
margin was at the top end of our expectations at 7
these good results reflect the steady implementation of our strategy

could you tell us about the groups commitment to sustainable
development
sustainable development is an opportunity to do our business with more added value for all our
stakeholders
our initiatives in that field are related to social societal and environmental aspects when it comes
to social actions our priority is the safety and development of our people regarding societal actions
particular emphasis is given to the national content of our projects and issues related to children
health disability and humanitarian activities for the environment reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions and prevention of accidental pollution are our main focus areas
we will be working even more on all these elements throughout the years to come technip is a global
company present in many countries and we have a key role to play in corporate social responsibility

what is your outlook for 2013
technip starts 2013 with a substantial profitable backlog of business to execute we believe our markets
while competitive and never immune to general economic conditions remain robust and growing
our clients continue to focus on replacing and raising production from increasingly challenging areas
and reservoirs they seek longterm relationships with contractors that are capable of developing and
deploying the right technologies and who can embrace national content and local execution upstream
investments should grow at a doubledigit rate and several very large oil and gas offshore developments
should be sanctioned in the next couple of years downstream will be particularly active in petrochemicals
notably in north america
we will continue to be selective about the projects we take on so as to ensure reliable execution and delivery
to both clients and shareholders we will pursue our capex program with a focus on delivering our current
commitments
on this basis we aim to grow group revenues by 11 to 16 to between 91 and 95 billion we expect to raise
revenue and profit at technip again in 2013 in both our segments we target fullyear operating margins of around 15
in subsea and 6 to 7 in onshoreoffshore in line with our longterm expectations
accordingly confident in our strategy our backlog and our potential for profitable growth we will propose at the
technips general meeting of shareholders an increase of 10 eurocents in the dividend to 168 per share in accordance
with our practice of encouraging a fair return for all

what is technips sustainable development strategy and how do you evaluate its
performance
our sustainable development strategy relates to social societal and environmental aspects our current level of
maturity allows us to develop and widen our actions to achieve our objectives and the expected level of excellence
sustainable development will be more deeply integrated into our business strategy to do so our action plan will
focus primarily on integrating more sustainable development into project execution setting up innovative pilots
in certain projects will then lead to a roll out for the most successful ones globally regarding climate change
we will focus on using ecodesign and lifecycle analysis in the infrastructures we build to reduce the longterm
impact on the environment
our strategy also includes working more closely with stakeholders and notably the local communities in the countries
where we operate developing communication towards our clients and reinforcing our relationships with socially
responsible investors
we have taken tangible steps towards improving sustainable development and have been committed to a strong and
widely recognized policy of corporate social responsibility csr for many years in 2003 we signed the united nations
global compact on human rights working standards environmental standards and anticorruption we apply
its ten principles to every aspect of our business
our csr efforts have been acknowledged in many ways we have been highly ranked in the dow jones
sustainability indexes for more than 10 years in 2011 the csr rating agency vigeo positioned technip
at number two in its industry
moreover we have received several distinctions for the quality of our sustainable development strategy

and pmp or our human resources policies with the top employers europe label in 2012 last year

communities by raising the national content of our projects to create local employment
to support our vision i have decided to reinforce our sustainable development network with more
coordination at group regional and entity levels to improve the way we share best practices
the group csr team will be in charge of social societal and environmental best practices as well
