introduction
translating passion into impact

mission
the nih mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the
nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that
knowledge to enhance health lengthen life and reduce the burdens
of illness and disability

the mission of the national institute of environmental health sciences niehs is
to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives


vision
the vision of niehs is to provide global leadership for innovative research that
improves public health by preventing disease and disability


sustainability
a healthy planet is essential for human health by promoting sustainability
niehs seeks to ensure that we will continue to have the materials and natural
resources to sustain and improve human health which includes promoting a
healthy environment as we perform vital research we remain focused on our
own footprint on the environment and human health

our institute has increased transparency and expanded our social network we
welcome feedback from our community regarding our research strategic plan
and sustainability measures working together with our stakeholders we benefit
from shared ideas and improved understanding

we continue to pursue and invest in energyefficient and environmentally
friendly technologies materials and products we work to reduce our waste
and pollution by reusing and recycling choosing greener alternatives in our
laboratories and diligently monitoring our waste streams we have increased our
use of technology as an alternative to air travel and employee commuting helping
reduce our overall carbon footprint our promise to continue such improvements
includes a commitment to report our progress to you and this report is a key
element of that public accountability

while focusing this report on the impact of our own operations we encourage
our partners and suppliers to join us in meeting the expectations set for us in
federal executive orders and in hhs policy together we can make a difference
and create a more sustainable world while advancing our scientific mission

a message from our director

we have continued to make significant progress in reaching our sustainability
goals our strong commitment to reducing impacts on human health and the
environment has been a driving force with creative input and effort from staff
throughout the institute

technology has enabled us to meet remotely create and distribute electronic
versions of newsletters and increase the efficiency of our operations while
creating energy reductions these and many other measures have helped us
reduce paper and printing cut energy and water consumption and increase our
waste diversion

since 2010 we have
     reduced water consumption 16 percent
     cut electricity use 75 percent
     increased recycling 41 percent
     added hybrid vehicles to our fleet
     removed 34 percent of our copiers and upgraded to more energy efficient
       models

to share best practices and collaborate on new projects we actively participate
in partnerships such as nih green teams and the nih sustainability management
team through presentations and outreach events hosted on our campus we
connect with scientists staff and visitors such collaboration and feedback is
critical to discovering new opportunities to improve our own sustainability as
well as to share our best practices with others examples include
     lab corridors  by moving recycling bins inside the labs we increased
       recycling while creating safer and cleaner hallways
     freezers  an investigation found that older ultralow temperature
       laboratory freezers can use the same amount of energy per year as a
       typical us home newer technology uses less energy and allows more
       storage capacity in the same footprint using a cash for clunkers
       program we cut the number of freezers and reduced energy use without
       loss of storage space

we are proud of our achievements and we have high aspirations for the future
thanks for your interest in reading this report and sharing in our pursuit of
sustainability

natural resources

the 511acre campus we share with the epa contains not only offices and labs
but also expanses of open fields and wooded areas it seems appropriate that an
environmental institute would be placed in such verdant surroundings we show
our gratitude and respect by protecting these areas for wildlife and preserving
land and water quality and natural beauty

we recognize the beauty of our campus and work every day to protect it for us
and the habitat it supports with more than 200 acres of forestry on our campus
and a 23acre lake we are reminded of our obligation to protect and preserve the
natural environment

we have intensified our efforts to identify and manage invasive species in natural
areas to determine potential impacts and consider future directions and planning
for example sterile nonproliferating carp were added to our oncampus lake
to control invasive aquatic plants thereby avoiding the need to use chemical
herbicides

energy and water

we are acutely aware of the potential effects of global climate change on the
environment and human health on the niehs campus we have experienced
weather extremes and changing weather patterns in recent years as a result
a focus on preparation and adaptation has sprung from necessity and helped us
become a leaner greener institute

biomedical research is energy intensive with more than 1 million square
feet of labs and offices it is challenging to find new ways to reduce surely
heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems are a large source of
consumption but requirements for the safety and wellbeing of those working
within a laboratory environment are paramount and force us to find new sources
for reduction

trends show a continued downward movement in our energy and water
consumption we have reduced water consumption more than 40 percent and
a new reverse osmosis water system is expected to reduce these numbers even
more recycling nearly 70 percent of our cooling tower blowdown water this
should cause a leveling of the water demand for the months of june july and
august instead of the large spikes in demand typically seen

the main use of energy on our campus is heating and cooling a weatherdependent
factor challenging but attainable goals have been set to reduce our energy intensity
3 percent per year we surpassed those goals for the last two years and plan to
reduce even more in the future we continue to search for ways to improve our
operations and energy and natural resource consumption through energy savings
performance contracts espcs establishing metrics and having conversations
with the scientific staff about their needs and how we can conserve more

we have made significant strides in upgrading equipment at our central utility
plant by replacing two older chiller units with a single highefficiency model we
will reduce energy remove outdated refrigerants and achieve more reliable and
efficient output

we have surpassed all expected goals for water reduction and continue to explore
opportunities to reduce even more with our new reverse osmosis system in
place we expect to achieve a reduction in the use of potable water for water loss
in evaporative cooling towers with a 70 percent return after treatment we could
reduce as much as 6 million gallons each summer we look forward to providing
more results like these in the future

waste and recycling

our regulated waste remains proportionally the same but a recent uptrend of
waste has occurred this increase is based on an increase in research activities
the turnover and decommissioning of some longstanding laboratories and new
regulations on the management of waste streams from our darkroom facilities

although the generation of regulated waste results from missionrelated activities
we continue to consult with research investigators to find alternative materials
and methods that are safer and less toxic

a new laboratory corridor policy increased the recycling of some items that were
previously sent to the landfill our recycling program has increased in activity
and volume as this corridor policy came into play this program put recycling bins
inside the laboratory space allowing for easier access for lab members along
with an increased frequency of collections

emissions

the high temperature hot water hthw generators boilers and emergency
generators produce emissions such as nitric oxide and nitrogen oxide nox
sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon monoxide co we have reduced the duration
time for testing emergency generators thereby reducing emissions mild winters
have also reduced the heating demand on the hthw generators and helped
maintain lower emissions

the air emission of metals eg lead and particulate matter continues to decline
slowly we continue to search for sources of these items to reduce even further
as an example we reduced the frequency of radioactive waste treatment using
incineration reducing our pathological waste by weight and volume also reduces
the reliance on incineration for waste treatment

  wastewater emissions have been on a downward trend for the last five years
  overall we have reduced the volume of wastewater nearly 50 percent from our
  baseline  a trend we expect to continue as we bring our reverse osmosis system
  online in 2013

transportation

with a 42 percent increase in teleworkers since the last report the institute
has stepped up its game to promote more worklife balance and flexibility for
its workers at the same time teleworking has reduced emissions from daily
commutes alternative commuting such as carpooling and bus transit has
increased slightly as well

maintaining and improving the fuel efficiency of our overall motor vehicle fleet
remains a challenge a targeted information campaign and enhanced training
helped achieve better compliance with the federal mandate to use e85 for the
flex fuel vehicles fleet fuel efficiency however remains an area of needed
improvement

biomedical research demands sophisticated and uptodate technology to keep
up with the pace of change and rapidly expanding data generation since our last
report the institute has taken steps to improve efficiency and stewardship of
information technology it resources some examples include
      it equipment energy reduction  using life cycle analysis for tracking
        and replacement and energy star guidelines for equipment usage
      network upgrade  allowing higher productivity for equipment and users
      video conferencing and remote meeting technology upgrades  reducing
        travel needs and improving efficiency
      spring cleaning events  taking old and outdated equipment out of service

looking ahead

with our goal of continuous improvement we will seek opportunities in all of our
operations to lessen our environmental and health impacts while advancing our
scientific mission in the near future we will focus on three priority areas
      enhance our initiatives in green chemistry to create safer laboratories
        and to further reduce chemical waste by engaging with our research
        investigators green chemistry options can be explored so that the
        purchase and storage of chemicals can be minimized and better aligned
        with mission needs
      achieve reductions in printing and paper use to conserve resources and
        lower energy consumption efforts would entail expanding the use of 100
        percent recycled content paper and encouraging electronic document
        storage and transmission
      include sustainability principles and features in the early stages of
        laboratory design and renovation to improve predictability and efficiency
        in the areas of sample supply and energy management
