               peak energy use and benchmark year for medium term performance assessment


            we have restated annual emissions back to 2011 a peak energy use and carbon emission benchmark year to present information on the
            most comparable basis our future four year carbon reduction programme for the years to march 2018 is to continue with our programmes
            of energy efficiency and investment in low carbon solar electricity generation our main carbon intensity measure is kg co2ecustomer
            occupied space m2 as this reflects new store openings and customer service use

            the department of energy and climate change and environment agency are two of the stakeholders in the policy for reducing demand for
            energy from industry businesses and the public sector the crc energy efficiency scheme is designed to cut emissions in large private
            sector organisations this legislation started in 2011 with a broad assessment of energy uses including electricity and gas the scheme
            uses a carbon dioxide conversion factor and so is not directly comparable to the companies act ghg equivalent reporting the current
            crc tax is 12 per ton of co2 and this will rise to 13 per ton in the year ending 31 march 2015 this year our crc taxation will reduce in

            based on the assurance work we performed nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the selected csr
            performance indicators as noted above are materially misstated

            what standards we used basis of our work and level of assurance
            we carried out limited assurance in accordance with the international standards on assurance engagements 3000 isae 3000 to
            achieve limited assurance isae 3000 requires that we review the processes and systems used to compile the areas on which we
            provide assurance it does not include detailed testing of source data or the operating effectiveness of processes and internal
            controls this is designed to give a similar level of assurance to that obtained in the review of interim financial information
