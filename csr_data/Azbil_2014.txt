  this was attributable to the inclusion of azbil telstar and its subsidiaries in the scope of consolidation despite improved
  profitability in the gas and water meter field we reported a segment loss of 07 billion from 04 billion in the previous
  year this was due to costs associated with reinforcing and expanding our business foundation and the effect of consolida
