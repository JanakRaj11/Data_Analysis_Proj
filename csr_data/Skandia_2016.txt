three pillars of sustainability
in short sustainability is a matter of working long
term to reduce impacts on people and the environ
ment traditionally the concept is described from the
perspective of three dimensions                                              environmentally
                                                                                sustainable
 social sustainability
 environmental sustainability
 economic sustainability

a prerequisite for sustainable development is that
                                                                                  sustainable
these three dimensions mutually support each other                               development
when we manage and use our resources in a longterm
sustainable manner                                              socially                       economically
   skandia works from this threepillar perspective            sustainable                       sustainable
when we gather the most material aspects in six
overarching areas these then form the foundation

         my feeling is that many think it is
         good that skandia acts and deals
with changes in the external operating
environment the path we have charted
out with early and transparent communi

make it easier for employees to engage
themselves in their work and contribute to
