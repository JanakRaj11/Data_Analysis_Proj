social responsibility is our business
corporate social responsibility has become one of those meaningful issues that periodically emerge that cannot be dismissed as merely a trend

government agencies businesses and individuals alike have embraced the concept in a much broader sense than merely an economic one sustainability must be
integrated into human rights societal issues and perhaps most important the environment it is a generational issue  perhaps the major issue of our time

at lexmark we operate our business in a manner that results in a better world from both a humanitarian and an ecological perspective we build products that positively
impact all the people our company touches and all those who touch our products from the first glint of an idea to a products end of life from our employees and their
families to our neighbors from our suppliers to our shareholders from our political governments to their citizens

we believe that accessible and regular documentation of our efforts to be a responsible corporate citizen is critical to improvement in our sustainability efforts we are
committed to transparency in running our business as well as in the reporting of environmental and social progress

we have identified six components of sustainability that in particular have substantial materiality to our operations and this report is segmented by those components
measuring progress against and in the context of goals and objectives is an integral part of lexmarks management approach




lexmark is committed to honest exchanges and believes that exploration and dialogue relative to these issues will result in advancing our efforts we want to engage our
stakeholders on every level and we realize their input is relevant and beneficial

in essence we are all stakeholders in each other constructive feedback is an important tool to help us enhance our sustainability click here to contact us

risks opportunities and impacts

the lexmark social and environmental impacts are divided into three focus areas and are addressed by corresponding initiatives product initiatives
                                                                                                                                                                      gri
operational initiatives and community initiatives                                                                                                                12 411
                                                                                                                                                                   ec2 so9
    product initiatives relate to the environment and social benefits of the solutions we develop these solutions help our customers reduce their
    environmental footprints meet the accessibility needs of their workforce and operate in a more responsible manner
    operational initiatives are all the things we do to reduce our own environmental footprint at lexmark facilities and to make lexmark a better employer and business
    partner through commitments to human rights and fair labor practices
    community initiatives are all the things we do to environmentally and socially improve the communities in which we live and work


at lexmark legal compliance in these areas is priority one we first make sure that we are complying with local
statutes wherever we have operations then we balance and prioritize our approach by assessing what needs to be
done and how best to do it to meet the needs of all stakeholders as completely as possible we continue to make
significant strides in these focus areas

for product initiatives we continue to develop product features and solutions that offer our customers opportunities to
reduce the environmental impact of their printing and imaging activities these efforts are validated by thirdparty
certifications including the electronic product environmental assessment tool epeat which is a method for
consumers to evaluate the effect of a product on the environment for more information go to wwwepeatnet during
this last reporting period lexmark research and development also focused more on social innovation that is
innovation that provides benefit to greater society for example lexmarks accessibility council worked to develop
enhanced accessibility features and solutions for 2012 lexmark products which include screen magnification and
improved physical accessibility

for operational initiatives we made great progress reducing the environmental impacts of our lexmark operations at our headquarters in lexington kentucky for
example we have significantly reduced the footprint for each employee in an ongoing siteconsolidation project in addition to increasing interactions among employees
our new consolidated space also reduces energy consumption significantly

for community initiatives we prioritized our corporate community focus on initiatives that support stem science technology engineering and math education
improvement and promote diversity by concentrating lexmarks resources on improvements in these areas we have made significantly more progress than with a focus
on a broader range of issues also as lexmark acquires more companieswe focus on learning from these new communities we now share and look for opportunities to
combine corporate and community resources to create stronger and more effective community programs

although we achieved many of our goals for the reporting period the company is committed to continual improvement in these focus areas in 2013 and beyond we will
look for opportunities to strengthen the environmental and social benefits of our product offerings improve the efficiency of our operations and deliver more positive
benefits to the communities where we live and work

risks and opportunities
corporate social responsibility csr trends have driven lexmark to evaluate the potential of physical risks and regulatory restrictions for our business and to consider
potential opportunities to enhance and capitalize on our product offerings through this due diligence we can help our customers achieve their own environmental
sustainability and social responsibility goals the most important risks and opportunities for lexmark that are related to sustainability trends a number of which are noted
in our annual sec filings include the following

1 environmental and regulatory matters
   lexmark operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations specifically those relating to environmental matters that impose limitations on the discharge of
   pollutants and that establish protocols for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes for more information about the impacts of lexmark
   regulatory topics see lexmark form 10k
2 electronic waste obligation
   the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive or weee directive issued by the european union require producers of electrical and electronic goods to be
   financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products our estimated liability for these costs involves a
   number of uncertainties and we consider certain assumptions and judgments that include average collection costs return rates and product life cycles should
   actual costs and activities differ from the our estimates revisions to the estimated liability might be required for more information about the impacts of waste see
   lexmark form 10k
3 climate change
   the predictions about the impacts of climate change have led lawmakers across the globe to take a precautionary approach proposing and implementing new
   regulations to guide governments businesses and citizens in their efforts to reduce global warming these regulations can potentially impact all businesses
   regulations requiring energy reductions are motivating consumers and businesses to replace wasteful equipment with energyefficient products lexmark recognizes
   that reducing energy use is one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions a major contributor to climate change lexmark environmental
   policies and programs support the reduction of greenhouse gases in our own operations and those of our customers partners and suppliers


   climate change and associated weather disruptions can affect the operations of all organizations our operations and those of our manufacturing partners suppliers
   and freight transporters are subject to natural and manmade disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather

  conditions environmental hazards power shortages water shortages and telecommunications failures any of these conditions can disrupt business and can
  adversely affect our revenue and financial condition by increasing our costs and expenses as lexmark continues to consolidate certain functions in shared service
  centers and moves other functions to countries with lowercost labor the probability and impact of business disruptions might increase over time for each of its sites
  lexmark has a business continuity plan that describes the risks of climate change for more information about the impacts of operational risks see lexmark form

4 product opportunities
  lexmark offers a wide range of environmentally beneficial and highly accessible imaging devices and software solutions that help customers print less and meet the
  accessibility needs of their workforces demand for such products and solutions can have a positive financial impact for lexmark

the lexmark board of directors regularly reviews our corporate governance practices including the current classified structure of lexmarks board of
directors after careful consideration including valuable shareholder input the board determined that it is in the best interests of lexmark and stockholders to declassify
the board which when fully implemented will allow stockholders to vote on the election of the entire board each year rather than on a staggered basis as with the current
classified board structure at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders lexmarks stockholders approved an amendment to lexmarks restated certificate of
incorporation to declassify the board each director elected by stockholders after the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders shall serve oneyear terms directors elected by
stockholders in 2011 2012 and 2013 shall continue to serve the remainder of their threeyear terms

other energy consumption




travel related energy consumption
our efforts to reduce energy consumption at lexmark go beyond the walls of our facilities as
with most companies our business needs frequently require some lexmark employees to
travel for facetoface meetings with customers partners and coworkers many of whom are
separated by significant distances the driver of lexmark scope 3 emissions

we always encourage the use of lowerimpact realtime alternatives such as conference calls
webbased meetings and videoconferencing integrating hightech solutions not only saves
energy but also increases the frequency and quality of our communications

when air travel is necessary lexmark sends only those employees who are absolutely
essential to accomplish our business objectives whenever possible employees are
encouraged to optimize their travel itineraries by combining several business trips and taking
public transportation such as trains and buses instead of taxis and rental cars

lexmark in collaboration with our vehicle provider tracks miles traveled with lexmarkowned 
leased and rented vehicles in the united states and europe in collaboration with our travel
agency we track us employee air travel worldwide preparations for the launch of lexmarks
newest product line resulted in increased miles traveled from 2011 to 2012 overall distance
traveled has decreased by 14 percent since 2005

while lexmark does not track distances related to our employees daily commutes we do have
workathome programs in place that are aimed at reducing the environmental impact of
commuting and improving worklife balance for our employees for example the lexmark
competence center in budapest hungary offers employees options for environmentally
preferred commuting the facility has bike racks and showers for employees who pedal to work
and offers those who prefer public transportation discounted monthly or yearly fares lexmark
employees who work at the lexington facility also have an opportunity to help reduce pollution
by taking public transit from a bus stop in our parking lot or biking to work lexmarks lexington
facility has bike racks and showers for employees who bike to work using lexingtons 12mile
legacy trail a shared use trail adjacent to lexmark or any of the citys bike lanes

product transportation
we rely on transportation every day to deliver our products to customers around the world
consequently transporting our products is an integral part of our business while we cannot
avoid this necessity we have taken measures to decrease the adverse environmental impacts
associated with these activities lexmark works with environmentally progressive partners who
apply innovative ideas and best practices to their transportation processes such as using diesel hybrid trucks or rapidly renewable biofuels

in september 2008 lexmark joined the us epa smartway transport partnership and exceeded the programs requirement for the amount of allowable freight to be
shipped with smartway carriers smartway a collaborative program between the us epa and the freight industry is chartered to increase the use of energyefficient
vehicles and has impressive goals to reduce greenhouse gases and decrease air pollution to help curb climate change lexmark pledges to continuously minimize the
environmental impact of its product shipments throughout the united states with great pride we continue our efforts to shrink our carbon footprint by reducing energy
consumption and emissions associated with transportation

other measures we employ to promote more efficient transportation include the following

    cube utilizationmaximizing the use and capacity of containers for the transport of our products is an effective practice we adopted to handle more cubic feet of freight
    per container shipment
    directshipping modelwith the directshipping model our goal is to reduce the total mileage our products travel with directshipping and directimporting models
    delivery service providers move freight directly from ports to customer destinations which eliminates warehousing en route similarly in the directimporting model
    ocean carriers pick up customerdirected products at key supplier points and transport the goods directly to the consignee eliminating inland cargo moves which
    increase energy usage and air emissions
    intermodal freight transportationlexmark is expanding the use of intermodal freight transportation an approach that optimizes transportation of freight per vehicle
    with multiple modes of transportation such as ocean rail air inland water and road also referred to as multimodal this approach reduces the miles a container
    travels as well as the number of times a product is handled during shipment which saves time money and fuel


supplier locations
in the interest of efficiency costeffectiveness and environmental benefits lexmark engineers are encouraged to select suppliers that are near the location where their
products are shipped such as near a manufacturing location when possible the use of locally based suppliers is both environmentally and financially preferable
resulting in positive local impacts

reducing greenhouse gas emissions
reducing energy use is one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions a major contributor to climate change at lexmark our energy reductions
are largely inspired by our desire to reduce these emissions

lexmark publicly reports greenhouse gas emissions that are related to the use of direct and indirect energy through the carbon disclosure project lexmark calculations
of greenhouse gas emissions are based on the world resources institute and the wbcsd ghg protocol

lexmark reduced its total greenhouse gas emissions by 39 percent from 2005 through 2012 by reducing energy use this reduction exceeds our voluntary goal to reduce
greenhouse gases in the past year lexmark was restructured to shift from a hardwarecentric company to a solutions provider the result is a reduction in the production
of inkjet hardware in addition to the acquisition of several companies which has changed our impact on the environment through reducing our total greenhouse gas
emissions

lexmark water usage is in part driven by the need to control temperature as external temperatures rise we use more water in our hvac systems to cool         en25
our facilities we cannot control the underlying primary variable in our coolingdriven water usageexternal temperature consequently we must
aggressively monitor control and reduce water usage where opportunities exist

at lexmark weve initiated several programs at our facilities worldwide to reduce consumption of water including installing more efficient hvac systems and improving
the efficiency of existing hvac systems installing lowflow plumbing fixtures desertscaping sometimes referred to as xeriscaping and reusing processed water in
manufacturing facilities in 2012 the lexmark headquarters in lexington kentucky installed 23 automatic faucets and 5 automatic flush valves to conserve water water
conservation is the primary reason we install automatic faucets and flush valves however a decrease up to 70 percent of water usage results in a cost savings and a
reduction in water waste by the end of 2014 we plan to spend 135 million upgrading lexington headquarters city underground water piping systems to reduce leakage
and improve reliability

we are committed to track and reduce the consumption of natural
resources at all our leased manufacturing facilities research and
development facilities and office spaces worldwide lexmark has
established the following corporate goals to guide our water
conservation efforts

      reduce water usage 20 percent 20052017
      complete the lexmark six point water conservation plan by end of
      2017


lexmark total water usage as purchased from local utility providers
is shown in the total water usage chart we have achieved a 33
percent reduction in water usage versus baseline year 2005 this
exceeds our goal of reducing water usage by 20 percent by 2017

this years 6 percent increase in water usage can be attributed to
warmer summers in north america the philippines and mexico and
the economic recovery driving increased production the reduction in water usage in 2012 compared to years prior to 2011 can be attributed to improved control of cooling
tower chemistry which in the first year alone resulted in a 28 percent reduction in coolingtower blowdown at headquarters also aiding in the reduction was the finding
and repairing of underground leaks and an increased reuse of water in our facilities in boulder colorado where there was a significant increase in recovered water in
2012 and an even larger decrease in reported total water use for the same period

some of this reduction can be attributed to the reuse of water lexmark reuses water in our manufacturing facility in lapulapu city philippines and in boulder colorado
our facility in lapulapu city collects used water and condensation from the air conditioning system in a nonpotable water cistern this water is later used for flushing
toilets and for irrigation the lapulapu city facility reused 16511 m 3 of water in 2012 similar reuse takes place in boulder that facility collected and reused 21412 m 3 of
water in 2012 reused water accounts for more than 5 percent of our total water use not including unmetered rain water

unpredictable temperatures and fluctuations in production result in positive and negative changes in lexmark water usage to help control this we implemented a six
point water conservation plan in 2009 this plan helps us achieve more significant controllable and sustained reductions in water usage going forward

neighbors have access to clean abundant and affordable water most lexmark facilities withdraw water exclusively from municipal water supplies and other water
utilities a limited amount of rainwater unmetered is collected and used by some lexmark facilities

planned discharges
waste water from lexmark operations is primarily discharged to local utility systems for treatment there are no bodies of water significantly affected by lexmarks water
discharges we discharge some water directly to nearby bodies of water in accordance with local laws and regulations these discharges have had positive impacts for
example lexmark occasionally discharges environmentally neutral water to the cane run creek that flows through lexmark property in lexington kentucky the wildlife
that depends on the cane run creek an impaired surface stream creek that is particularly vulnerable in times of drought benefits from the occasional addition of water
so that fish birds and other wildlife can survive during times when the water level in the creek is otherwise detrimentally low

annual water discharges are assumed to be equivalent to total water consumption all water dischargeswhether planned or unplanneddestined for the local utility or
nearby bodies of water are closely monitored by site facilities and environmental teams that test for water quality

unplanned discharges
in an effort to prevent negative impacts on the environment lexmark has established sitespecific pollutionprevention plans that encompass compliance with applicable
environmental regulations outline lexmarks proactive pollutionprevention efforts and specifically address spill prevention hazardouswaste management recycling
and water quality these plans cover multiple pollution routes including discharges to ground air and water they cover all lexmark owned manufacturing and research
and development facilities worldwide

lexmark reported no significant spills in our 2012 financial statement in an effort to continually improve our processes we record and investigate all spillsregardless of

size or impactas directed by site iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 and other corrective and preventative action programs

comparing 2012 with 2011 spending at north american facilities decreased by 53 percent with some global sites reducing spending by as much as 20 percent due to
an increased level of production at our philippines and mexico sites the overall lexmark total water spend increased by 15 percent

waste management and recycling programs
business waste management and recycling programs
lexmark has established waste management and recycling programs at all our facilities worldwide for example at the lexmark headquarters in lexington kentucky we
have established programs to collect and recycle a variety of materials including construction waste cafeteria waste electronic waste such as endoflife computers and
telephones aluminum cans batteries cardboard office paper glass bottles metal scraps from our tool rooms plastic bottles florescent light bulbs and cell phones
several of these waste streams are recycled in unique ways for example carpet recovered during remodeling efforts and scraps from new construction projects are
recycled in a closedloop process the carpeting and backing are separated processed and then made into new carpeting cafeteria waste from food preparation is
composted and fertilizes gardens throughout lexington paper from lexmark offices are recycled as bathroom tissue and paper towels

sustainability progress boulder colorado
at our facilities in boulder colorado working with flortum we reuse plastic trays as drum
packaging this worldwide project has kept 103 metric tons of waste from landfills the recovery
and reuse of 27 million photoconductor drums 84 percent from juárez mexico facilities and 16
percent from boulder represents 333 metric tons of waste recovered

we reclaim and reuse waste solvent which we use in our photoconductor manufacturing process
and we compost food waste and paper towels also we send out our scrap wood pallets to be
reused scrap paper glass plastic and cardboard is recycled saving it from landfill disposal and
scrap aluminum and metal is reclaimed for future use much of our liquid and solid waste that have
btu value becomes fuel substitutes and our boulder facilities continue to reduce our
nonrenewable energy demand by purchasing 1 million kilowatt hours of wind energy as well as
implementing energy reduction initiatives

lexmark campus employees and contractors and employees and contractors can also recycle                   laser cartridges are returned to lexmark for reuse and
their batteries for personal use                                                                          recycling the program generates the following

lexmark invested 500000 to upgrade the facilitys water treatment plant which included adding a             1439 metric tons of cartridges and parts for
flocculation and coagulation process and a filter press to recover more water reduce sludge                    remanufacture

lexmark has additional programs in place to recycle packaging for example lexmark has
established a shipping container reuse program with our primary electronic waste recycling partner             1913 metric tons of recyclable cardboard
additionally wooden pallets are reused and recycled damaged pallets are chipped and used as                   543 metric tons of other recyclable material plastic
mulch and certain types of styrofoam are sent to an extruder for reuse                                       aluminum wood metals
in lexington many of the surrounding counties that our employees live in do not provide curbside
recycling services for recyclables out of the home consequently lexmark has partnered with the
lexington fayette urban county government to collect those recyclables onsite a large recycle bin
is available for employees to drop off items such as newspapers plastics glass bottles
cardboard and aluminum cans an estimated 225 tons of recyclables has been processed through this program since its inception in 2007



development and production waste management and recycling
the development quality testing and manufacturing of lexmark imaging devices can result in the generation of unique waste streams including chemical waste ink
toner and component development and manufacturing paper waste print testing and printers and other electronic components performance and quality testing

chemical waste is primarily processed in an energyrecovery facility which generates electricity while processing chemical waste a portion of toner chemical waste is
processed by a company that uses the toner as a colorant in plastics toner waste is also used as an additive to concrete paper from print testing is recycled as
bathroom tissue and paper towels

waste generation and recycling statistics
lexmark generated a total of 22361 metric tons of waste in 2012 waste generation in 2012 was
higher than 2011 as a result of increased production volumes of printer supplies and increased
volumes of used printer supplies being recycled

at our lexington site ongoing consolidation of our facilities generated additional waste in the form
of recycled construction debris this shortterm impact provides longterm benefits from reduced
carbon dioxide lexmark expects this shortterm increase in waste to yield longterm environmental
benefits from ongoing projects to reduce waste and optimize process and facility operational
efficiency

hazardous waste accounts for approximately 8 percent of total lexmark waste the primary
hazardouswaste materials are residues from manufacturing and development processes
hazardous waste that is generated in lexmark research and development and manufacturing
facilities is managed by external companies that specialize in the management of hazardous
waste

waste recycling
disposal methods for waste are determined through the collaborative efforts of lexmark and our wastemanagement partners working together we have identified new
opportunities for recycling waste reducing our usage of incineration and landfill while increasing usage of wastetoenergy recovery where other recycling options are
unavailable since 2007 lexmark has increased its waste recycling rate from 63 percent to 75 percent lexmark achieved our recyclingrate goal of 75 percent

electronic waste recycling
lexmark offers our customers environmentally sound choices for disposal of their endoflife
products electronic waste including printers that have reached the end of their usable life should
be recycled by specialized firms that have processes to ensure any data stored on those devices is
not compromised and that are committed to recycle those devices in an environmentally and
socially responsible manner

lexmark has partnered with recyclers that offer a broad range of services and processing
capabilities have a proven record of compliance with governmentmandated criteria for recycling
facilities are iso 14001 certified the environmentalmanagementsystem standard and are
certified by r2 solutions or estewards

the r2 solutions r2 standard is a comprehensive global criteria for erecyclers in the market and
requires responsible management of used computers and other electronics the estewards
standard is a rigorous internationally compliant certification from basil action network ban based
on iso 14001 that assures full conformance to a comprehensive suite of erecycling best practices
both r2 solutions and ban are working to ensure the electronics recycling industry is
environmentally sustainable our recycling partners are audited regularly to ensure that they
continue to maintain the high level of service and regulatory compliance that we expect of our recycling partners

the primary lexmark recycling partner sims recycling solutions the worlds largest electronics recycler is r2 certified sims recycling processed more than 5500
metric tons of electronic waste on behalf of lexmark in the united states canada and europe in 2012

lexmark also partners with global environmental services ges offering solutions for customers that prefer estewards ges with facilities in georgetown kentucky
and austin texas is the seventh largest electronics recycler in north america the lexmark service organization works with our recycling partners to reclaim parts that
can be used to refurbish printers which keeps them in service longer and reduces the need to recycle used hardware devices that are returned to lexmark go through a
process that assesses if they can be refurbished for reuse and if not are harvested for parts that can be used in the refurbishment process

lexmark has set a goal to achieve a 30 percent increase in hardware collection and recycling by 2014 as compared to baseline year 2007 from 2010 to 2011 lexmark
increased its hardware collection rate by 48 percent which means we can achieve our goal by 2014

lexmark currently offers standardized recycling
programs in many countries and variable programs in
other countries we expanded the lexmark equipment
collection program in 2012 and plan to further expand it
in 2013



united states
in the united states we offer the lexmark equipment
collection program customers can return their
lexmark hardware products to us by whatever shipping
method is most convenient for them and we recycle the
equipment at no charge for business customers who
are in the process of installing a large fleet of new
lexmark products lexmark develops customized
collection strategies we work in partnership with

storage and sorting facility where the equipment is properly processed for recycling

asia pacific
a primary focus for asia pacific environmental work has been preparation for the australian national endoflife it equipment and recycling program this was formally
announced by the australian federal government in november 2009 lexmark has been an active participant in this process for six years the scheme began formally in
2012 and is across all australia supported by government regulation

in this endoflife program all it manufacturers and importers are responsible for their shares of actual waste collected customers return their endoflife it equipment to
designated collection points from which the waste is taken to central consolidation and collection points for recycling by accredited recycling operators

the pilot for this national plan is the byteback program operated in the australian state of victoria lexmark was a founding member of this operation which is an it
equipment takeback program that is no charge to customers there are nine other founding it industry members byteback has been in operation since 2007 and is
collecting some 10000 items per month the program has proven to be invaluable for collecting data on it hardware recycling and understanding consumer behavior
consequently byteback has received strong community support we continue our pioneering work in this area by actively contributing to the it industry groups now
preparing for the forthcoming national legislation and the start of the national takeback plan

latin america
the regions of central and south america present many logistical challenges for recycling several countries and local governments including argentina buenos aries

province brazil columbia costa rica ecuador mexico peru puerto rico and venezuela have recently enacted forms of epr extended producer responsibility
legislation lexmark is working closely with our recycling partner sims recycling solutions to set up regional recycling centers to meet these new requirements

recycled paper becomes new product packaging
in 2011 lexmark mexico supply base management and the operations team approached our supplies
packaging engineers about an opportunity to make a positive difference for the environment the operations team
wanted to do more than just recycle the paper produced from testing lexmark toner cartridges

the collaborative effort of the teams produced an innovative process of converting the test pages to molded pulp
cushions the pulp cushions are a cost effective solution and also provide a high level of protection to lexmark
toner cartridges during shipment the new packaging cushions are used to protect our new high end and low
end cartridges can be recycled and are made from 100 percent postconsumer lexmark waste

for their efforts on this project lexmark was recognized as a manufacturing leadership 100 award winner
ml100 in the sustainability category the ml 100 awards are given by the manufacturing leadership council
and recognize those that are shaping the future of global manufacturing

designing products with responsibility in mind

the environment and social issues are primary concerns in todays society and consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental and social impacts of
the products they use consequently the environmental performance and social impact of products is a key issue for businesses large and small at lexmark our design
efforts focus on minimizing the environmental impacts of our products and offering products with social benefits in these essential areas

product life cycle

the lexmark life cycle assessment lca provides us with a realistic databased
evaluation of tradeoffs in the product design manufacturing distribution use and end
oflife of our products more importantly lca data indicates the potential improvements
we can make systemwide across our entire enterprise by incorporating lca results in
our productdesign process we can develop sustainable products that combine high
standards of performance efficiency and environmental stewardship

to clearly understand the environmental impact of our printers lexmark examines each
phase of a products lifefrom product design to endoflifewith a product lca each
lca is done according to the iso 14040 and iso 14044 standards we commission
thirdparty environmental companies to assess our products we also submit our
findings to independent reviewers

lexmark commissioned lcas for several of our products including the lexmark
x646dte monochrome laser multifunction printer mfp as well as the lexmark x544de
and lexmark x736de color laser mfps the findings measured our products
environmental impact on multiple indicators in accordance with methodology established in 2002 by the institute of environmental sciences leiden university in the
netherlands the significant environmental indicators that were measured include the following

    global warming potential and climate change
    nonrenewable resource potential abiotic depletion
    nonrenewable primary energy demand
    water footprint


lca results for the lexmark x736de color laser mfp indicate that the printers main carbon and water footprint 62 percent for carbon footprint 854 percent for water
footprint is from paper consumption during printing more energy is consumed to produce a single sheet of paper than required to print or copy it the production of a
single sheet of paper consumes about 17 watthours which is approximately 50 times the amount of energy to print a single sheet lcas on our printers reveal that the
lexmark commitment to print less save more is an effective approach to improve sustainability efforts for lexmark and its customers

product acoustics

acoustics is the science of sound and vibration and designing products for the
                                                                                            gri
environment includes considering audio comfort in the workplace lexmark printers          en26
offer an ideal combination of efficient performance and quiet operation to enhance
comfort in the workplace which increases productivity

the lexmark design teams assess our equipment acoustics and focus on reducing unwanted
noise while selectively incorporating helpful sounds finding technical solutions to unwanted
noise requires creativity and innovation since 2009 all laser products are designed with a quiet
mode feature with this setting customers can adjust the sound level of their printers to meet their
personal preferences

germanys blue angel ecolabel was one of the first to include noise levels in its certification
criteria today all lexmark laserprinting products meet the noise requirement in the blue angel
specification raluz 122

materials

the variety of technologies used in lexmark printers includes several different types of materials ranging from plastics to metals to ceramics the largest
                                                                                                                                                                      gri
quantity used in lexmark products by volume are plastics such as hips highimpact polystyrene and abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene other plastics           en12
include polyesters polyamides and filled or blended versions of these materials usually manufactured from gas and petroleum feedstocks the                       en26
environmental impact of these feedstocks can be offset by increased use of recycled plastic metal content in lexmark printers is dominated by steel
products sourced from both recycled and new feedstocks other types of metals and ceramic alloys are used in smaller components of our systems




postconsumer recycled content
lexmark continually strives to optimize our use of postconsumer recycled pcr materials in our products by using pcr materials we can have a positive impact on the
environment reducing both consumption of natural resources and the amount of waste in landfills

lexmark recognizes the environmental benefits of reusing metal content understanding that recycled metal stock can be used for somebut not allmetal components
published industry averages indicate that many commercial grades of steel commonly contain between 30 to 80 recycled content lexmark is committed to using
these grades of steel with recycled content wherever possible

ensures that waste formerly earmarked for a landfill has a new destination and purpose helping to protect natural resources it also means lexmark and our customers

are making significant progress to achieve our sustainability goals

closedloop recycling
lexmark continues our innovative closedloop tonercartridge recycling operations capitalizing on our awardwinning lexmark cartridge collection program lexmark
engineers reclaim a feedstream of highimpact polystyrene plastic after returning this material to near virgin quality it is incorporated in new toner cartridges thus closing
the loop reclaiming this material is another reason we are proud to demonstrate leadership in our industry lexmark is our industrys leader with 10 percent average
postconsumer plastic content across lexmark toner cartridges lexmarks goal is to increase the post consumer plastic content in toner cartridges to 25 percent by 2016

we also use similar techniques in our closedloop recycling of lexmark inkjetcartridge plastic reclaiming cartridge bodies from our return program we reuse 25 percent
of this material in closedloop recycled plastic that is used for manufacturing components for new lexmark inkjet cartridges

because of these two programs lexmark was the first printer manufacturer to successfully implement a closedloop recycling system for both ink and toner cartridges at
lexmark were proud to support this effort and are always working to expand these highly sustainable recycling programs


 restrictions of hazardous substances
 when specifying materials used in lexmark printers supplies and packaging we evaluate compliance with material restriction directives and legislation lexmark
 complies with the materialrestriction requirements adopted under the european union recast restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical
 and electronic equipment directive 201165eu known as rohs 2 which restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the
 rohs directive limits the amount of four metals lead mercury hexavalent chromium cadmium and two brominated flame retardants polybrominated biphenyl and
 polybrominated diphenyl ether which can be used in our products at lexmark we comply with rohs international legislation and are committed to bringing rohs
 compliant products to world markets

 as lexmark develops new products we work closely with all our suppliers to ensure that all materials in lexmark products are compliant with the rohs directive we
 are committed to continuously improving the environmental design of all of our lexmark products and services reducing environmentally harmful materials such as
 those listed in the rohs directive is a part of our commitment too for example a few years before the rohs requirements went into effect lexmark completely
 eliminated pbbs and pbdes from our products since july 1 2006 all lexmark products including ink and toner cartridges have been fully compliant with the rohs
 directive


registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals
at lexmark in cooperation with our suppliers we are vigilant to ensure that the correct processes are in place for our continued compliance with international material
restriction regulations including the european union registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach regulation reach seeks to improve public health
and the environment by controlling the production and use of harmful chemical substances in 2008 lexmark completed the first steps of reach including pre
registration material review and required communications associated with the initial release of the substances of very high concern svhc candidate list of chemicals
as reach evolves with chemical registration deadlines and the addition of new chemicals to the svhc list on a regular basis lexmark will continue to track reach
developments and comply with all requirements of the reach legislation more information about lexmark reach initiatives is available to our customers by request

montreal protocol
at lexmark we apply the montreal protocol to all our products lexmark prohibits the use of ozonedepleting chemicals in the manufacture and development of lexmark

lexmark aggressively tests recycled papersspecifically papers made with 30 50 and 100 postconsumer recycled contenton all lexmark imaging devices our
expectation is that the runnability of recycled papers in lexmark devices is equivalent to the runnability of virginfiber paper while no allencompassing official standard
exists for office equipment use of paper lexmark has studied and employed european standard en 12281 as a minimum properties standard and runnability guide for
test paper to ensure breadth of testing test paper includes 100 recycled papers from europe and asia also testing conditions are conducted at 8 to 80 relative
humidity in an attempt to cover all physical paper variables relevant to office equipment use testing includes automatic and manual duplex printing which has the
potential to be challenging with some recycled papers

lexmark cartidge collection program reducing waste to landfill
the lexmark cartridge collection program lccp continues to divert millions of lexmark toner and inkjet cartridges annually from landfills by enabling
                                                                                                                                                                    gri
our customers to return used print cartridges for reuse and recycling to lexmark free of charge currently our collection programs are available in more           en2
than 60 countries which represent approximately 90 of our global market




our customers can return individual toner cartridges by placing the used cartridge in the new cartridge box and applying the prepaid label other methods of returning our
toner cartridges include bulk returns and container pickup service for largevolume customers availability varies by country for inkjet cartridge returns customers can
request free recycling bags from the easytouse lexmark website in addition to other countryspecific inkjet cartridge collection methods




our extensive cartridgecollection network has made lexmark an industry leader in the recovery
remanufacturing and recycling of empty toner cartridges the number of empty toner cartridges we
collect and process continues to be impressive in 2012 our customers returned more than one out
of every three toner cartridges shipped in some regions the lexmark return rate is even higher in
the united states for example the number of toner cartridges returned has continued to average
between 40 percent and 50 percent of shipments over the past several years we believe that
industry average collection rates are between 20 percent and 30 percent

we credit this achievement to our customers exceptional commitment to the environment along with creative incentives that make it easy to do the right thing for the
planet such as

    c540x540 series rewards programa unique program for our new c540x540 series color laser printers that rewards customers for recycling their used toner
    cartridges with lexmark customers can earn free high yield toner and imaging kits for returning their empty cartridges to lexmark in 2012 this program was

    expanded to include our new cs31 cs41 cs51 series color laser printers
    lexmark return program cartridgesprogram for many of our most popular printer models
    toner and inkjet cartridges are sold at discounted prices in exchange for agreeing to return the
    empty cartridges only to lexmark
    singapore return programlexmark participates in the project homecoming initiative
    supported by the nea national environmental agency and the nlb national library board
    the initiative encourages the recycling of cartridges through easily accessible bins in 13 nlb
    libraries
    expanding the cartridge recycling container programin 2012
    lexmark continued to expand the use of our cartridge recycling
    containers to customers in the united states and we initiated a pilot
    program in canada these north american customers join the
    thousands of customers in more than 25 european countries that
    already use the lccp cartridge recycling container


    cartridge recycling containers are designed to be displayed and used at customers locations to facilitate freeofcharge recycling of both lexmark toner and ink
    cartridges additionally the containers enable lexmark eco reports which provide customers with a measure of the sustainability benefits related to their returned
    cartridges




giving customers a choice
weve made recycling toner cartridges and keeping them out of landfills easy especially with the broad selection of lexmark cartridge
offerings

    lexmark regular cartridges can be returned to us through the lccp
    lexmark return program cartridges offers customers an upfront discount in exchange for their agreement to return the cartridge
    only to lexmark
    lexmarkcertified reconditioned toner cartridges are a qualityassured remanufactured alternative


resource conservation through recycling and reuse
not only does the lccp help reduce landfill waste but it also conserves natural resources in conjunction with our recycling program when managing the end of life for
the empty cartridges that our customers return to us lexmark always aims to be at the top levels of the standard environmental hierarchy at the bottom of the hierarchy
are landfill disposal and incineration the least desirable options at the highest levels are recycling and reuse which produce the greatest sustainability benefit for the
environment to consistently scale this environmental hierarchy lexmark follows a zerolandfill and zeroincineration policy for all empty cartridges that we collect of the
empty cartridges returned to lexmark 100 percent are either reused or the materials are recycled




our ultimate goal is to give as many cartridges as possible a second life by reusing their materials since 1996 lexmark has reused over 37 million pounds of recovered
cartridge material by converting millions of empty toner cartridges to lexmarkcertified reconditioned toner cartridges the eligible empties that we collect are
disassembled and cleaned and the critical components are replaced with genuine lexmark components each reconditioned cartridge is tested to assure highquality
output and reliable performance

we have been consistently moving up the environmental hierarchy between 2004 and 2012 by continually optimizing our collection and remanufacturing processes
lexmark was able to gain a more than fourfold increase in the absolute amount of cartridge materials reused through our collection program in 2012 approximately 30
percent of the cartridge materials by weight returned to lexmark were reused the lexmark goal is to increase this percentage to 50 percent by 2018

lexmark toner cartridges that cannot be successfully reconditioned are deconstructed with a process that maximizes materials recovery for use in secondary products in
2012 we again recycled or reused more than 10000 metric tons of plastic metals and packaging conserving these materials for reuse in cartridges and other
products translates into fewer raw materials that need to be mined or extracted and thus reducing the impact on the environment

endoflife management toner cartridge carbon footprint

lexmark uses life cycle assessments lcas extensively to better understand the environmental
impact of our cartridges and as a guideline when considering potential product and process design
improvements an lca is designed to evaluate the environmental impact of a product throughout its
lifetime from raw materials extraction production distribution and use to the end of its life cycle
these studies demonstrate just how significant the benefit to the environment can be by recycling a
used toner cartridge through the lccp the lexmark lca cartridge studies by a third party in
accordance with the iso 14040 and 14044 guidelines for lca demonstrate that sending a used
lexmark toner cartridge back to lexmark for recycling as opposed to discarding it in a landfill
reduces the overall carbon footprint of those cartridges studied by up to 50 percent excluding paper
consumed during the use phase

use of postconsumer recycled content
in 2012 lexmark continued its use of postconsumer recycled pcr plastics to manufacture some
of our new toner cartridges the lexmark tonercartridge product line contained on average 10
percent by weight of pcr plastic in some models the pcr content of newly molded plastic
components can provide up to 28 percent by weight of the plastic used the lexmark goal is to
increase this percentage to 25 percent by 2016

rolloff packaging
lexmark highend multifunction printers are protected by foam packaging to ensure the safe delivery of devices to
our customers recognizing the opportunity for improvement the packaging team initiated a project aimed at
increasing the amount of recyclable material in the packaging as well as improving the ease of unpacking

the foam packaging components have been replaced with easytoremove corrugated wrap style cushions that
are easy to recycle to aid in the removal of the printer from its shipping box the packaging team created rolloff
packaging which includes a ramp to easily lower the printer from the pallet to the floor the redesigned
packaging greatly improves the customer experience unpacking the printer as well as minimizing the packaging
impacts on the environment by increasing the recyclable content and minimizing landfill waste

conflict mineralsthe lexmark position




tantalum tungsten tin and gold regardless of where they originate are defined as conflict minerals these items are used in a wide variety of electronics and consumer
products including lexmarks printers and printing cartridges one region where these minerals are sourced is in the great lakes region of africa notably in the eastern
provinces of the democratic republic of the congo and bordering nations this region has been involved in an ongoing conflict which has been funded in part by the
illegal trade in conflict minerals lexmark as part of its corporate social responsibility program is engaged with the electronics industry citizenship coalition eicc an
organization devoted to improving social and environmental conditions in electronics supply chains and to help identify the origin of these minerals

the united states enacted the doddfrank statute and related sec regulations which require electronics
companies to report on the existence of conflict minerals in their products and the sourcing of those minerals
the purpose of the legislation and related sec reporting is to promote peace and security in the eastern
democratic republic of congo by supporting efforts of the government of the democratic republic of congo
other governments in the great lakes region of africa and the international community by monitoring and
ending commercial activities involving the natural resources of the democratic republic of congo that
contribute to illegal armed groups and human rights violations in the democratic republic of congo
companies who use products that include conflict minerals are required to report on the existence of those
minerals in their products and the source of such minerals lexmark fully supports this goal and is committed
to working with a responsible supply chain

lexmark is aware that some of its products contain one or more of the conflict minerals though at this time lexmark is not aware of any sources of conflict minerals
which support the prohibited activities of concern as part of its ongoing effort to responsible sourcing lexmark began analyzing its supply chain in 2012 in accordance
with eicc electronic industry citizen coalition processes and sec regulations to identify conflict minerals used in lexmark products and their origins this analysis is
an exhaustive comprehensive and timeconsuming process involving lexmarks suppliers and is planned for 2013 completion the initial reporting under sec rule is
due may 2014 at this point in the analysis we are not aware of any sources of conflict minerals which contribute to illegal armed groups or human rights violations in the
affected region  but we are continuing to examine our suppliers sourcing as well as the sourcing of their suppliers to work toward our goal of being able to certify that we
are conflict free

    the corporate governance and public policy committee of the board of directors is responsible for seeking future board members the committee does not set
    specific minimum qualifications including specific requirements for diversity that nominees must meet for the corporate governance and public policy
    committee to recommend them to the board of directors for election but rather believes that each nominee should be evaluated based on his or her individual
    merits taking into account the needs and composition of the board at the time the corporate governance and public policy committee considers candidates for
    election who would bring a wide range of attributes to the board the general criteria that the corporate governance and public policy committee looks for in
    candidates is a person of high integrity with i broad generalmanagement experience in a significant organization ii experience with major management
    technical operational marketing or financial issues iii diversity of background and thought or experience in areas of special interest to the company such as
    brand development or technology iv strong track record of success v strong international experience vi board experience at other international companies
    vii ample time to devote to board duties and viii ability and desire to serve multiple terms as a board member with respect to diversity the corporate
    governance and public policy committee believes that a director nominee with a diverse background professional experience education skill and differences of
    viewpoint fulfills that specific attribute and contributes to a heterogeneous board in the past the committee has identified director nominees from various

    sources including officers directors and professional search consultants but the committee also considers nominees recommended by stockholders the

supplier responsibility
our membership and participation in the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc has further strengthened our organizational efforts in support of human rights
labor standards and other csr corporate social responsibility values the eicc code of conduct is a pledge of best practices adopted and implemented by some of
the worlds major electronics brands and their suppliers to improve conditions in the electronics supply chain the code sets forth performance compliance auditing and
reporting guidelines across five areas of social responsibility including labor health and safety environment management systems and ethics policies in accordance
with eicc guidelines lexmark conducts thirdparty audits for several of our tier 1 suppliers to monitor compliance in these areas

lexmark works with a multitude of direct and indirect suppliers approximately 100 of these account for the majority of direct spending by lexmark all lexmark suppliers
are required to comply with the eicc code of conduct which also addresses human rights in addition we have increased our scrutiny of the human rights records of
lexmark suppliers

analyzing and managing supply chain responsibility
to better understand csr risks in the supply chain lexmark analyzes the spending behavior of that chain evaluating basic information total number of suppliers
geographic spread and so on as well as social and environmental aspects such as supplier diversity and environmental factors these spending analyses are
conducted with specially developed datacollection tools and are conducted in collaboration with consultants specializing in supply chain analyses

over the last three years 100 percent of lexmark procurement spending was subject to our spendinganalysis process through this process we have identified critical
suppliersour highvolume highspending suppliers suppliers of critical components and nonsubstitutable suppliers lexmark has nearly 13000 suppliers 27 percent
of which have been identified as critical1 the percentage of our critical tier 1 suppliers for which lexmark procurement represents more than 30 percent of the suppliers
total revenues is less than 1 percent

less than 1 percent of our suppliers are determined to be high risk with the depth of that analysis varying based on how critical the risk is based on the results of the
spend analysis lexmark has chosen to conduct a deeper analysis of economic cash management environmental weatherrelated and social war and political
instability risk factors

these risks are managed in part through the eicc code of conduct this code prescribes best practices related to
environmental performance in operations human rights forced or child labor freedom of association ilo conventions
working conditions working hours layoff practices remuneration occupational health and safety and business ethics
corruption anticompetitive practices

self audits and site audits using the code are conducted through the eicc to date approximately 200 lexmark suppliers
including global key and strategic suppliers those with which 2012 spend was over 1 million and those that are lexmark criticalpart supplierswere asked to complete
the eicc saq selfassessment questionnaire and enter performance data in a webbased datacollectionandanalysis tool that helps companies collect manage and
analyze social and environmental responsibility data from suppliers

these suppliers account for a significant percentage of lexmark total procurement spending based on 2012 spending 236 suppliers make up about 80 percent of our
spending and our top 100 suppliers make up about 65 percent of our spending in 2012 additional key and strategic suppliers are being asked to provide this data we
expect that by 2014 100 percent of the top 80 percent of our suppliers by spending will have completed the saq

one womans journey at lexmark




linda hollembaek lexmarks vice president and general manager of global services operations talks about her personal career journey and how lexmarks
worklife balance programs have helped her advance through the ranks at lexmark while achieving goals in her personal life

i began my career at eastman kodak company in rochester new york at eastman kodak i was able to take on a variety of assignments across many crossfunctional
areas serving in system analyst financial analyst corporate real estate and field service planning roles allowed me to build my business knowledge in the early years of
my career

in 1999 i discovered an opportunity to kick my career into high gear i was offered a position with lexmark that would allow me to grow my leadership and business skills
i was excited for the opportunity but concerned about uprooting my young family lexmark headquarters is in lexington ky more than 650 miles from my hometown in
new york state moving would have meant moving my children to a new school relocating extended elderly and disabled family members who relied upon us for daily
care and impacting my husbands work

lexmark gave me the opportunity to take on a new challenge while living in new york for close to five years i lived in rochester new york and traveled around the globe
leading the development of the operational infrastructure of a new business within lexmark  our solutions and services business the ability to telecommute and the
global experience of working with our large enterprise customers and our geographies allowed for personal growth pulling on the broad experiences from earlier in my
career in 2003 while in new york i was named vice president and general manager of worldwide customer delivery operations of lexmark services

by 2004 the time was right to move my extended family to lexington ky with the support of lexmarks leadership team we were able to successfully transition our entire
family to lexington

early in 2005 i was asked to lead a portion of the supply chain organization from 2005 through 2013 we integrated all worldwide supply chain operations including
planning supplier based management manufacturing logistics and service centers into one organization my responsibilities increased significantly throughout this
time and i continued to grow my expertise and business acumen

while serving in this role lexmark encouraged me to set aside some time to work on issues that were important to me personally and were important to lexmark from
20052006 i led lexmarks diversity council while serving in this role we created diversity network groups dngs and launched programs and initiatives that helped
lexmark develop an increasingly inclusive culture a few years later i was asked to serve as the chairperson of lexmarks sustainability cross functional team cft
from 2008  2011 during that time our company issued its first ever corporate social responsibility report ingrained sustainability in its development processes and
marketing messages won numerous awards and was added to socially responsible inventing sri indexes im currently serving as the executive chairperson for
women  work one of lexmarks most active diversity network groups

while i enjoy serving in roles that advance social and environmental issues at lexmark i want to give back to the greater community lexmarks volunteer time off vto
program allows me to contribute to the community without making a tradeoff of precious family time i use my vto hours to serve on local boards and am a member of
the university of kentucky college of business mba advisory board serving in these roles supported by my leadership allows for highly satisfying personal growth and
the feeling of giving back to the community

customer journey maps can hold the key

bestinclass companies use customer journey maps as a solid foundation in managing the customer experience

according to forrester research customer journey maps are documents that visually illustrate customers processes needs and perceptions throughout their
relationships with a company the journeymapping process helps firms align around a shared vision of target customers identify broken moments of truth and get the
insights they need to improve

lexmark began the journeymapping process in 2012 and maps are being created for each business area where the customer experience is different maps are created
internally and then validated with customers who either confirm or challenge the internal view of the customer experience and identify the key opportunities for
improvement a governance team of senior leaders is assigned to each map the team designs improved customer experiences in those areas identified as most
important

lexmark has programs and policies in place that guide our decision making and operations prior to entering a community while we are operating in a
community and as we exit a community these programs and policies help to ensure that our impact on the communities we live and work in is positive




prior to entering a community
lexmark carefully considers potential social and environmental impacts of doing business in all our locations b efore building or opening a facility in a community our
corporate real estate and facilities team assesses all proposed locations taking into consideration among other things the potential for severe weather such as
floods or tornadoes the proximity availability and reliability of police and fire departments local crime statistics government stability and our operations potential impact
on local utilities and ecosystems

whenever possible we choose to do business in locations that have stringent environmental safety and labor regulations in place that protect the environment and local
residents as well as assist lexmark in compliance the environmental screening tools and checklists used by the lexmark corporate real estate and facilities teams
ensure that lexmark sites are as energy efficient as possible before starting operations

whether lexmark builds a new building or chooses to lease an existing facility our preference is to use a previously industrialized area that choice precludes the
deforestation and habitat destruction that comes with building in undeveloped areas it also offers the benefit of locating our operations near the homes of employees
and thereby reducing commuting time and distance which in turn increases employee alternative transportation options walking biking public transportation

operating in a community
while lexmark does not have a global policy for granting preference to local residents when hiring in significant locations of operation most employees are members of
the local community and are offered educational and skilldevelopment opportunities we also offer transfer programs where employees in one region can go to another
to train for a job for a few weeks to as many as a few years

the lexmark presence has positive impacts on the economies of the communities surrounding our locations through our efforts to provide aboveaverage employee
compensation and use of local resources where possible a significant number of lexmark employeesincluding those in the united states mexico and the philippines
work in locations that have minimumwage laws lexmark is committed to rewarding our employees for their hard work lexmark and its subsidiaries around the world
offer salaries and benefit plans that are highly competitive in each of the countries in which we operate plans are benchmarked frequently to ensure that compensation
and salary levels remain competitive so we can attract and retain employees in each region these efforts to provide aboveaverage employee compensation have a
favorable economic impact on the markets in which we do business


the patronage of lexmark and its employees increases business for local utility companies service providers restaurants and retailers the corporate taxes paid by
lexmark and additional wage taxes paid by our employees help support local governments and schools these impacts are quantified in terms of dollars spent for
example highlights of the lexmark economic impact worldwide in 2012 are




the lexmark commitment to our communities including contributions of equipment volunteers and financial support to social organizations can also be quantified
volunteer hours for 2012 exceeded 150000 hours of service at more than 300 nonprofit organizations

lexmark has not conducted a formal communityneeds assessment but based on feedback from local citizens charities and governments needs and requests are
addressed when reasonably possible

the decision to exit a community
over the past several years business needs including a changing product portfolio and demand for increased operational efficiency have resulted in the geographical
movement of several lexmark operations recent plant closures have included an inkjet facility in scotland 2006 inkjet supply manufacturing facilities in juárez 2007
and chihuahua mexico 2008 as well as a circuitassembly facility also in juárez 2009

in 2012 lexmark announced a restructuring plan to shift from a hardwarecentric company to a solutions provider the restructuring plan resulted in reductions primarily
in inkjetrelated infrastructure as well as positions in research and development the supply chain manufacturing and other support functions the lexmark inkjet
supplies manufacturing plant in cebu philippines was acquired in 2013 by a lexmark partner to continue to manufacture supplies employees in cebu will continue
manufacturing inkjetsupplies as employees of the new company

communities experiencing losses have had to deal with increased unemployment and a decreased tax base lexmark takes care to reduce the impact on the locations
that experience these losses when exiting buildings we ensure that the locations are clean and secure we make every possible effort to avoid leaving an unoccupied
building and we comply with all local laws to ensure that employees and local governments are given notice of imminent changes and assistance in their efforts to
secure new employment in some instances even offering some nonexempt employees the opportunity to continue their employment with us at other lexmark facilities

while there are no standard metrics that can be used to gauge the effectiveness of these efforts we have seen evidence that these initiatives have eased negative
impacts the lexmark inkjet facility in chihuahua was purchased by a developer who leased this facility to a manufacturer in an effort to help the community transition this
property to another manufacturer lexmark ensured that the existing building was not left unoccupied and that the new occupant offered employment opportunities to
laborers in the area

continuing employment pace posted the following on its web site with regard to our closing of the scotland lexmark facility
