as a family business in its third generation and a leading international manufacturer of
heating and cooling technology systems we are committed to the principle of sustainability
it guides our activities and is securely anchored in our company principles


we are committed to fulfilling our economical ecological and social responsibilities we
ensure that all our processes are environmentally compatible and encourage the use of
renewable forms of energy our aim is to protect the climate and preserve the natural
basis for life we value and involve ourselves in the scientific artistic and cultural life of
our society


sustainability will be a crucial success factor for every company in the future it is essential
that we conserve the environment use resources more efficiently and avoid waste the
growth needed to maintain our current level of prosperity must be generated from intelligent
value creation in the future not from the overexploitation of resources the environment or
the climate


as the largest consumer of energy in germany the heating market offers tremendous
potential for saving energy energy is still wasted in 80 percent of buildings because they are
heated with obsolete technology in addition up to 40 percent of final energy consumption
could be eliminated in the industrial and manufacturing sectors


the necessity to protect the climate and save energy has led to a greater use of renewable
energy and particularly energyefficient products both in the heating technology sector and
other industries in cooling and refrigeration technology the implementation of economical
environmentally friendly systems can also greatly help to achieve the efficiency objectives
defined by policymakers integrated solutions which comprise heating cooling and air
conditioning systems combined with customized energy management are becoming
increasingly important


the structural shift towards efficient technologies and renewable energy has given rise to
risks and challenges opening up great opportunities the environmental and energy sector is
on its way to becoming a flagship industry it has the largest rates of growth in investments
and jobs climate protection innovation and economic success go handinhand today or to
put it another way sustainability pays off


however sustainability must be actively practiced therefore the current sustainability
report of the viessmann group provides information about our strategic approach to
sustainability and the individual steps we are taking to implement our concepts


this report has been drawn up for our most important stakeholders our customers our
employees suppliers policymakers and public administrations the media organizations
and associations as well as the general public together with these partners we want to
make sure that sustainability continues to be a guiding principle for our business activities in
the future therefore we are looking forward to constructive discussions and a cooperative
dialog with all groups in society

                   social responsibility
                   climate change and the scarcity of natural resources are the major challenges of our
                   times sustainable development is becoming increasingly important in all areas of life


                   preserving the earth was called for as early as                                     greatest challenge for mankind

                   scarce trees were cut down to build homes                                          and due to the resulting emissions have a

                   this question embodies the essence of                                               however the oftencited transition to a

viessmanns sustainability project for resource efficiency climate protection and job
security


as part of viessmanns sustainability
strategy the sustainability project for improved
efficiency is based on an integral concept for
resource efficiency climate protection and
job security the project serves as an example
of best practice and is designed to motivate
other companies as well as political and
administrative decisionmakers to advocate
or implement similar measures to improve
energy work and material efficiency


the main purpose of improving the
efficiency of work processes was to increase
the competitiveness of jobs and in doing so
to contribute to securing the allendorf eder                                                        viessmann grows

                                   green electricity reduce co2 emissions even further
                                   in order to tap further potential for increasing efficiency and protecting the climate
                                   viessmanns strategic sustainability project is being developed on an ongoing basis


                                   the retrofitting of the energy center                 second biogas plant in operation
                                   completed in 2012 has increased the share             moreover a second biogas plant in allendorf
                                   of biomass in the heat supply from 50 to              eder is in operation it is a wet fermentation
                                   80 percent the longterm goal is to supply           plant from viessmanns subsidiary schmack
                                   all energy using this climatefriendly fuel           biogas gmbh which produces 16 million
                                   source this is governed by the principle of          cubic meters of biogas from 15000 tonnes of
                                   sustainability in other words only using as          substrate annually in concrete terms using
                                   much biomass as can be regrown in the same            this biogas can provide 1650 households with

                                   next step is to reduce energy consumption             anywhere there is a gas connection
                                   even more additional efficiency measures             regardless of where it was generated in the
