                         dear readers


                         the global economic and financial crisis has shown clearly that shortterm thinking and
                         actions can have dramatic consequences as a raw materials company we think in the
                         long term and it is our overriding goal to run our business successfully in a sustainable
                         way and to act responsibly the growth of the ks group is focused both internally and
                         externally on the raw materials and rawmaterialrelated sector this becomes clear in
                         our vision source of growth and life through nutrients and minerals and is expressed by
                         the largest acquisition in our companys history that of the us salt producer morton salt


                         passion for salt
                         we and morton salt share the same passion for the salt business in addition to this
                         there are only minor overlaps with our existing salt activities in business operations
                         these are the best prerequisites for a smooth integration already months before
                         day one  the symbolic first day together of ks and morton salt on 5 october 2009
                          a team of german and later also american employees commenced preparations for
                         the integration the resulting processes will accompany us during this year and the next


                         as a result of the acquisition we have established a broader base in the salt business
                         made ourselves less dependent on developments in the fertilizer business and have
                         become the worlds largest salt producer already now morton salt has changed us
                         considerably morton salt makes the ks group stronger and morton salt will show
                         that it is not shortterm action but longterm and if necessary anticyclical action that
                         promises success


                         preserving jobs despite the crisis
                         the year 2009 made it clear to us how important a balanced relationship between our
                         core business sectors fertilizers and salt is in the wake of the financial crisis the fertilizer
                         markets shrank at an unprecedented speed and to an extent that was previously uni
                         maginable within a year sales volumes of globally operating potash producers plunged
                         by about 50  as a consequence we were compelled to cut back production sharply
                         as well as to adjust it in terms of specific product groups and sites about 88  of the
                         employees at the german sites of the potash and magnesium products business seg
                         ment were therefore forced to work short time this tool has however made it possible
                         for us to preserve jobs despite these difficult times for the economy

preface




              a fair balance of interests potash production and water protection
              in 2009 too water protection on the werra and weser and the demands taken to us were
              our main issues we know and accept that the balance of interests has become more
              difficult than ever not only in our industry and that constant dialogue is required we
              therefore regard the constructive cooperation on the round table on water protection
              werraweser and potash production as a success our cooperation with the federal state
              governments residents and environmental associations combined expertise and tech
              nical knowledge and more than 70 concepts were examined to see whether further im
              provements in water protection could be made a key factor here was that proposals
              had to be technically politically and economically feasible as well as meaningful


              in february of this year the round table argued that ks should completely cease the
              discharging of saline waste water into the werra and its underground injection from 2020
              at the latest and construct a pipeline to the north sea costing several hundred million
              euros even though important prerequisites for this have not been examined or fulfilled
              we could not agree to this


              we are convinced that with our integrated package of measures and the related invest
              ments of up to  360 million we can harmonise economic interests and ecological re
              quirements while at the same time meeting our corporate responsibilities for ensuring
              thousands of jobs in the potash industry from 2015 the measures will result in the re
              duction of saline water by 50  and that of the salt concentration by 30 


              this report is intended to make a contribution to communicating even better our con
              cerns and our efforts to achieve a fair balance between the economic ecological and
              social interests of our stakeholders we not only present in detail our efforts to protect
              water but also explain how potash fertilizers work which supply the soil with the
              nutrients necessary for healthy plant growth and replace the nutrients removed by the
              harvest we invite our stakeholders to engage in a dialogue with us

we also note that companies extracting raw materials in germany are in an increasingly
difficult position but extracting and processing raw materials forms the basis of our
industrial society and therefore also of the prosperity created here if we are to remain an
industrial and exporting society and want to preserve the related jobs as well as continue
to create considerable value interventions in nature cannot be avoided however the
current discussion about sustainability particularly in the industrialised nations is largely
conducted from ecological perspectives the needs of a growing global population are
almost ignored meeting them is however an important social issue and can only be
achieved together with the economy


successfully coping with the demographic change
as a result of the increasing internationalisation of our ks and ever more complex tasks
the demands on our employees are increasing we also have to anticipate that in future
we will have an older workforce while the employment market is providing fewer and
fewer young people how are we to cope with this demographic change successfully
by means of a demographic analysis in 2010 we want to examine more closely the spe
cific circumstances in our group in germany and derive measures for our succession
planning from this already in 2009 we again increased our trainee ratio we will continue
our training activities at this high level


shaping the future together
i would especially like to wholeheartedly thank the employees of our ks group which
has now grown considerably after the takeover of morton salt for their tireless coope
ration their determination and the exemplary flexibility that they have demonstrated
during the serious crisis currently the sales volumes in the fertilizer business are picking
up again appreciably and the salt business this year is again profiting from good demand
for deicing salt nevertheless we will face great challenges also in 2010 we are there
fore counting on the commitment of every individual employee


i thank our shareholders customers and partners of the ks group for your trust
support and the open dialogue in the past financial year we want to continue to shape
the future and impress you with our performance

                                       porate growth strategy  in the interest of all our stakeholders


                                       economic ecological and social goals are treated with equal importance the concept
                                       of sustainability is closely related to our business operations we are conscious of the
                                       responsibility associated with the use of natural resources we handle our resources

                                       employees as best we can and give young people solid training that is how we remain
                                       futureoriented


                                       for us acting sustainably and in a socially responsible way means finding responses to
                                       new challenges early on on the one hand this requires the implementation of innovative
                                       solutions at every stage in the value chain and on the other hand it means observing
                                       global megatrends attentively and assessing their relevance to our business in this way
                                       responsibility becomes future viability and thus leads to an increase in corporate value
                                       and added value for the company


                                       groupwide control of this sustainability strategy is the responsibility of the board of

complex fertilizers  a balanced mix
in addition to nitrogen ks nitrogens complex fertilizers contain the nutrients potas
sium and phosphate as well as magnesium sulphur or trace elements depending on
needs and the application the raw materials are combined in the production process
in a liquid or semiliquid state and then granulated as a result each fertilizer grain
contains precisely the same combination of nutrients to allow for controlled even spread
ing on the field the complex fertilizers containing potassium chloride branded as
nitrophoska are used for arable crops such as cereals or corn the nitrophoska pro
ducts containing potassium sulphate are recommended for chloridesensitive fruit
grapes and vegetable crops


special nitrogen efficiency
the nitrogenstabilising entec fertilizers have achieved broad acceptance on the
market in only eight years they are characterized by their nitrogen efficiency and thus
reduce the number of applications necessary in comparison with traditional products
entec fertilizers are used both for arable crops and special crops such as fruit grapes
and vegetables


needsbased nitrogen supply
the straight nitrogen fertilizer calcium ammonium nitrate kas can be used for all agri
cultural crops ammonium sulphate nitrate ass which contains sulphur next to
nitrogen is suitable for crops requiring sulphur such as rape furthermore we market
ammonium sulphate nitrate with boron ass bor for crops requiring boron such as
sugar beet


leading with ammonium sulphate

ammonium sulphate a byproduct arising during the production process of caprolactam
in the chemical industry finecrystalline ammonium sulphate is used in europe predo
minantly as a raw material in fertilizer production overseas farmers spread it directly
onto the fields granammon a coarsegrained ammonium sulphate is suitable both
for direct application in agriculture and as a component in bulk blenders

in future the agricultural sector will not only have to feed more and more people
but will also have to cope with changed climatic conditions in important regions
of cultivation all over the world we are conducting research into new nutrient
combinations and develop solutions in order to support our customers in carry

water use by plants because if the current trend persists water will become
the most important bottleneck factor for agriculture during the next 50 years

              field tests are indispensable for the success of our work the knowledge we obtain allows
              us to assess the correct form of nutrient volume of fertilizer and time of application
              for specific locations ks kali gmbh ks nitrogen and compo are currently supervising
              approximately 250 field tests all over the world

              increasing acreage yields
              in order to achieve higher yields plants have to absorb quantities of nutrients that meet
              their specific needs in particular during their growth period together with its test part
              ners ks kali gmbh has trialled systems which use sensors to measure the status of the
              supply of nutrients to crops as a result of this indeed a more precise determination of
              the nutrient content was possible than was previously in the next step new methods
              for more precisely determining the nutrient content of the soil will be tested since in
              particular potassium magnesium and phosphate remain in the soil over a relatively long
              period of time

              fertilizers regulated by thresholds
              our potash and magnesium fertilizers are natural products the majority of which are
              approved for ecological farming in accordance with eu law which do not constitute a
              hazard to the environment if applied correctly this also holds true for nitrogen fertilizers
              for water conservation areas the european legislator has set thresholds and imposed
              particular conditions


              if high concentrations of potash fertilizers reach the water or soil as a result of improper
              use and storage or due to transport accidents this can lead to salt damage if nitrogen
              fertilizers are used improperly this may result in an overfertilization of waters and have
              an impact on the nitrate content of drinking water we make this clear to our customers
              and provide safety data sheets describing which safety measures are to be adopted for
              storage and transport


              nitrogenstabilising fertilizers produce less laughing gas
              even when nitrogen fertilizers are used properly it is not possible to completely prevent
              the emission of climaterelevant laughing gas ks nitrogen and compo both offer
              nitrogenstabilising fertilizers these contain a nitrification inhibitor which ensures that
              nitrogen is converted more slowly from the soil bacteria thus reducing laughing gas
              emissions by up to 50  moreover the plant is supplied with nitrogen for longer and
              more consistently


              in close cooperation with basf compo and ks nitrogen systematically examine
              possible washingout and ammonia volatilisation losses for new product lines at the
              basf agricultural centre limburgerhof in an ecoefficiency analysis entec a
              nitrogenstabilising product of ks nitrogen was compared with two competing pro
              ducts not contain nitrification inhibitors during a crop rotation period of three years
              the findings show that when entec is used significantly more nitrogen is utilised and
              the losses are therefore lower than in the case of comparable conventional products

                           poor economic situation the demand also remained low over the year in 2009 the
                           foodgrade and industrial salt segments by contrast proved to be relatively stable and
                           were hardly affected by the economic crisis

revenues and earnings
   at  36 billion revenues fall 26  year on year
   in financial year 2009 we achieved revenues of  35738 million which was 255  below
   the figure for the previous year fourth quarter revenues benefited by  2376 million
   from the firsttime consolidation of morton salt adjusted for this effect revenues would
   have totalled  33362 million


   a slight seasonality was evident from the quarterly revenues figures posted during the
   course of the year thus the first quarter tends to be the strongest and third quarter
   the weakest in terms of volumes the fertilizers business sector usually profits in the first
   quarter from the start of the spring fertilizing season in europe although the autumn
   fertilizing season occurs in the third quarter it is however less important than the spring
   fertilizing season in terms of sales volumes the deicing salt business is normally focused
   on the first and fourth quarters of a year while during the second and third quarters
   customers stock up at prices that are usually more favourable

   the decline in revenues in 2009 can be particularly attributed to negative volume and
   price effects which it was not possible to compensate for by means of positive currency
   effects and consolidationrelated growths in revenues during the fourth quarter the
   potash and magnesium products and nitrogen fertilizers business segments had to accept
   declines in revenues due to significantly lower sales volumes and prices in the salt
   business segment on the other hand high sales volumes of deicing salt during the first
   and fourth quarters and the firsttime consolidation of morton salt in the last three
   months of the year had a positive impact on revenues


   the potash and magnesium products business segment again posted the highest rev
   enues of all the ks groups business segments accounting for 40  of the total and was
   followed by nitrogen fertilizers and salt in europe we achieved revenues of  18963
   million 42  thus despite the sharp decline against the previous year a good 53 
   of total revenues were still generated in this region the european market is very impor
   tant for us because we can normally leverage shipment cost advantages revenues in
   the overseas markets which will be even more important in future as a consequence
   of the acquisition of morton salt rose by 10  to a total of  16775 million

                        ally support the pentup demand for fertilizers in 2011 we therefore expect to see a
                        further increase in the sales volumes of the mineral fertilizers we offer so that there are
                        good opportunities for both revenues and earnings of the ks group to increase further

                                         ignored issues of economic appropriateness and the ability of the pipeline to be financed
                                         finally the question also remains open of whether as a result of the construction of a

                                them can choose whether to invest in projects to reduce emissions or to buy emission

                                            in 1997 for the selective deconstruction of closed sites we set up a longterm program
                                            with the aim of carrying out the aftercare of inactive plants in a structured way the
                                            costs for this total over  120 million so far the program covers 28 disused sites in lower

                                            we have succeeded in harmonising economic ecological and social aspects a company
                                            belonging to the mars group decided in 1993 to shift the entire catsan production to
                                            salzdetfurth after it had previously only obtained a raw material from there since 1995

                    of steam was obtained from the waste heating plant of eon at the werrawintershall
                    site in absolute terms there was a significant reduction in energy consumption which
                    is attributable to restraint in the purchase of potash fertilizers an additional factor is
                    the relatively higher proportion of rock salt in overall salt production in comparison to
                    evaporated salt as a consequence of higher sales volumes of deicing salt we have fed

                    it has been possible to constantly reduce energy consumption per tonne of produced
                    goods in recent years we have set ourselves the goal of decreasing specific energy con

                                      number of employees has risen significantly
                                      on 31 december 2009 the ks group employed a total of 15208 people compared
                                      with the previous year 12368 employees the number has thus risen by 23  this is
                                      attributable to the acquisition of morton salt 2933 employees


                                      in the nitrogen fertilizers business segment in 2009 we have merged the activities of
                                      fertiva with parts of compos professional business to create ks nitrogen this involved
                                      the transfer of 105 compo employees to ks nitrogen furthermore in order to make
                                      the inevitable job losses 145 employees as socially acceptable as possible we agreed
                                      with the employees representatives on a reconciliation of interests with a social plan
                                      which provides for example offers of alternative jobs within the company and train

                               in 2009 the personnel expenses of the ks group were  7564 million and therefore
                               slightly above the level of the previous year 2008  7385 million savings connected
                               with shorttime working were faced with the increase due to the initial consolidation of

                               support amounted to  171 million in the year under review and was therefore primarily

                               ground in germany these positions were largely reserved for male employees until
                               31 july 2009 pursuant to legal regulations sec 64a of the german federal mining act
                               these regulations have now been revoked by the legislator


                               this complies with the efforts of ks to interest more women in careers in technology
                               starting in summer 2010 we will train the first female mining technologists


                               the proportion of female employees in the ks group is 10  and at those sites with

                               the average length of service is 18 years both document the high loyalty felt by employees
                               towards the company


                               the average age of our employees is 43 due to demographic circumstances we antici
                               pate that in future we will have an older workforce because the employment market
                               is providing fewer and fewer young people through a demographic analysis we want
                               to investigate the specific circumstances in our group in germany in more detail and
                               derive measures from it that will secure the ability to work qualifications and motivation

                                      due to the fact that predominantly women take advantage of parttime work but women
                                      only make up 10  of the entire workforce

                               this by also enabling them to participate materially in the companys success in this way
                               we strengthen their interest in commercial success as well as in the share performance
                               and increase their loyalty to our company in the long term our remuneration system in

codetermination




                   codetermination
                      for us codetermination means involving employees in important decisions early on
                      because we are convinced that informed employees are better motivated and more ready
                      to share the consequences of difficult decisions which will therefore be implemented
                      more quickly and above all more efficiently codetermination promotes and presents
                      a challenge for taking on responsibility not only in the short term but also in the medi

responsibility in the supply chain

                                        the relationships with our service providers are characterised by open and fair dealings
                                        we expect our suppliers and transport service providers to comply with human rights
                                        and internationally recognised core labour standards professed by the ilo international

                                        when placing orders we cannot exclusively restrict ourselves to regional suppliers how
                                        ever due to logistical advantages and a precise knowledge of our requirements and
                                        facilities regional suppliers with which we have been cooperating as partners for a period
                                        of years are well able to hold their own in competition with supranational suppliers
                                        95  of our contractual partners come from oecd states organisation for economic

                                        optimal utilisation of transport carriers
                                        the ks group shipped 366 million tonnes of goods in 2009 as a result of weak sales
                                        volumes in the potash and magnesium products business segment the transport volume
                                        declined about 10  in 2009 this particularly impacted on transports by rail and ship
                                        since fertilizers are frequently transported by water and rail to wholesalers interim
                                        storage sites or to the hamburg kalikai we exploit all means of transport optimally
                                        taking advantage of their individual benefits


                                        it is not only we as a contractor who profit from this but equally our customers and our
                                        partners in the logistics sector as far as possible we transfer shipments from the road to
                                        the more environmentally friendly rail and waterways the successful logistics concepts

                                        we not only train our own employees in loading safety but also place an emphasis on
                                        well trained drivers for our partner freight forwarders in 2009 we had to record two

                 gri guidelines
                    the guidelines of the global reporting initiative gri are internationally recognised
                    guiding principles for sustainability reporting they propose reporting principles and
                    specific contents designed to increase the comparability of company reports and im
                    prove the quality and the accuracy of reports although these guidelines are applicable
                    to all companies they cannot take into account the specific requirements of individual
                    industry sectors such as the fertilizer and salt industry therefore although we have
                    aligned our reports with the guidelines as far as possible we have in addition included
                    aspects in our reporting that are of particular relevance for the ks group
