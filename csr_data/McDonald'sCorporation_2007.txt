                                  we are a registered organisational stakeholder of the gri and support the mission
                                  of the gri to develop globally accepted sustainability reporting guidelines through
                                  a global multistakeholder process




page 2       mcdonalds 2006 worldwide corporate responsibility report

    about the scope of this report
    for this report we focused on the most relevant issues that we along with our customers and other major
    stakeholders consider the highest priorities to identify these priorities we used various source materials
    including the plan to win mcdonalds global business strategy consumer research internal subjectmatter
    leaders our owneroperators our suppliers expert advisory councils nonproﬁt organizations and the ceres
    stakeholder group explained below we also took account of the global reporting initiatives draft g3
    sustainability reporting guidelines

    for speciﬁc examples and performance measures we have focused on our nine major markets australia
    brazil canada china france germany japan2 the united kingdom and the united states the designation of
    major markets reﬂects many factors including sales revenues operating income number of restaurants
    and potential for growth by design there is representation from all the major geographic sectors where we
    do business in 2005 the nine major markets collectively accounted for approximately 75 of total revenues
    82 of total sales and 80 of mcdonalds restaurants worldwide

    stakeholder guidance the ceres stakeholder group

    to further ensure we addressed the right issues in the right way we engaged the help of ceres  a coalition of investors
    environmental organizations and other public interest groups that work with a select group of companies including mcdonalds
    to strengthen their social and environmental programs

    through ceres we established a ceres stakeholder group who encouraged us to report our progress and future efforts in the
    open doors spirit they challenged us to talk about our limits and opportunities for improvement as well as our achievements
    they recommended we take a deeper dive into how we get things done particularly how we seek to achieve global objectives in our
    highly decentralized system and they advised us to report more metrics and goals whenever possible

    you will see a ceres stakeholder questions and perspective at the opening of each chapter of the report and one within the
    environment section in the place chapter in these ﬁve locations the ceres stakeholder group elaborates on the issue and its
    impacts and importance and asks mcdonalds to respond

    the three top issues identiﬁed by the ceres stakeholder group are

         what are we doing to help address current trends in obesity page 16

         how are we using our purchasing power to inﬂuence the upstream supply chain page 26

         how are we addressing the systems impacts on climate change page 62

    we asked the ceres stakeholder group for their perspective on two other areas as well

         what is the reality of working at a mcdonalds restaurant page 42

         how do our philanthropic efforts align with our business strategy page 54

    ceres has not endorsed or validated the views and information in our report but rather provided guidance on the approach and the
    substance we learned a great deal from their input and hope you will see it reﬂected in the report

food safety also very important is the issue of sustainable              mike roberts theres a change occurring with customers
food supply its something weve been working on for the                 customers expect corporations to be very active in this area
last ﬁve years and were proud to talk about the sustainable             customers want to know what the company stands for what are
programs we have in place relative to ﬁsh and other products             the values of the leadership team and are they executed in
our commitment to social responsibility also includes animal              the restaurants they expect that as a part of who theyre going
welfare our standards for how animals are treated are                    to do business with its important to our business and the
absolutely world class                                                   momentum that were building that they know more about us

jim skinner ray kroc liked to say that we had principles when            kellie m c elhaney do you sometimes feel alone in
we were poor and were certainly going to have them when were            the industry
successful and were rich ray and fred turner set the highest
                                                                          jeff stratton as issues arise many of our competitors and
quality standards possible so those suppliers had to jump that
                                                                          other companies that we do business with look to mcdonalds to
hurdle they had to be able to deliver that and it went on and on
                                                                          lead and i think weve done that in many areas we have to act
and on any time you look at any one of our suppliers around the
                                                                          like a leader and that means that we have to pull together the
world today those expectations continue we look at taste and
                                                                          industry to talk about an issue that could affect us all i think
quality ﬁrst not efﬁciency not cost
                                                                          we are more proactive on that than ever in asia we just pulled
frank muschetto the proﬁle of the suppliers that we select               together many of our suppliers along with our competitors
is consistent with several attributes that we identiﬁed years             and our competitors suppliers to talk about the avian inﬂuenza
ago that we felt support what mcdonalds is about one of                 issue we were the nucleus of putting that together and
them is about their commitment to corporate responsibility if            we did it with the united nations with their support and their
they dont have it if its not endemic to their business if its not    participation we take leadership very seriously
strategic to the business forget it while we have some very
notable names in our supplier community kraft coke just to            we work to make sure that rigorous food safety standards are
name a couple im just as proud of some of the entrepreneurial          upheld in all of our restaurants training food safety and quality
smaller companies that have that same high level of standards            the development of our food and our menu  it all ties in because
jeff stratton one of the other examples that weve used in               many of our suppliers consider themselves extensions of our family
a lot of our discussions with people around the company is the            and so they have the same rigorous approach to this as we do inside
toy business last year over a billion toys were produced for            the company  jeff stratton
distribution through mcdonalds happy meals and i believe
that not one child spent a night in the hospital this record             frank muschetto but this story is typically not well known
is due to our high safety standards for the design and                    outside the four walls of our ofﬁces although i will tell you that
manufacturing of our toys we do a tremendous amount of work              in dealing with the various areas of the scientiﬁc community
on the safety and security side and the supply chain side and             government academia as well as within the industry
also audit facilities in countries such as china and vietnam that         mcdonalds impact is more well known now its great that they
produce a lot of these toys auditing helps make sure we hold             know but the challenge that we have is how to tell our story in
those suppliers accountable                                              a way so our customers can start appreciating how much weve
                                                                          actually delivered because i could cite chapter and verse where
                                                                          we have helped lift the standards of a food system in a country

mike roberts and we should talk about another aspect of the          your personal responsibility it is my personal responsibility     for positive
ways we engage with the world at large like our partnerships        for the way i behave in my life now what we are responsible      change retail
very few companies have as many advisory councils as we do of         for is making sure that we allow enough choice and opportunity     is not just about
                                                                                                                                         revenueits about
outside experts lending their credibility and their advice to how     for you to choose mcdonalds and feel good about it its a        responsibility
we govern                                                            small distinction and its very difﬁcult to communicate
                                                                                                                                        mike roberts

ill be part of this because you have a great impact on a lot of      this table are going to leave a tremendous legacy jim what
people if i can help inﬂuence mcdonalds while communicating         do you want your legacy to be

mary dillon advocating for balanced active lifestyles is            tenure longterm sustainable growth talent management and
something that has been a terriﬁc leadership move on the part         leadership development because its about the people
of mcdonalds and it was a function of our own realization as        a better process of reaching down into the organization of high
well as expertise and advice from our external global advisory        potentials and giving them the opportunity to be developed on
council we did three things one is offering more choice on          the leadership side and on the management side and balanced
our menu the second started by our european team is putting        active lifestyles which i took as a personal challenge not
nutrition information on packaging the third is advocating for       because we wanted to just move ourselves out of the target
physical activity which weve done all around the world and spent    zone but because we wanted to be part of the solution all
a tremendous amount of resources on                                  three legs of our stool which are our employees our owner

kellie m c elhaney jim what do you see as the future of

csr for mcdonalds

jim skinner for us at mcdonalds its a way of life and its       it doesnt matter if there are arches up in that country or not if there
a continuum  the processes that we have in place around              are children in need if there are families in need and we can play a part
supply chain and opportunity for employment and food safety           in solving some problems or helping get over some challenges for them
and all of the things that we do that are so important to our         then were going to do that  ken barun
communities and giving back through ronald mcdonald house
charities it is something that we expect to continue and we
                                                                      kellie m c elhaney i think with this leadership in place and
want to contribute at a very high level
                                                                      the strategy that is linked directly to your business youre
kellie m c elhaney what are the other issues mcdonalds              on a great trajectory and i wish you a lot of luck in seizing
is facing                                                            the opportunity thank you for your time
mary dillon well theres no question childhood obesity is
on peoples minds at mcdonalds and as a mother i take this
issue very seriously its about not only what kids are eating
but their relative lack of activity so its important that we
take leadership stances to educate and act on both sides of
this equation encouraging balance is an important ongoing
responsibility  making sure that we offer choice that we have
the right information available to parents as theyre making
decisions and certainly supporting and celebrating activity
with kids

countries so that it now covers countries representing 84 of our revenues
worldwide by the end of 2006 coverage will have been extended to restaurants
representing more than 94 of worldwide revenues

under roip both companyoperated and franchised restaurants are subject to
periodic onsite reviews of their performance the reviews identify strengths
and opportunities for improvement and provide the basis for training and other
action plans

in addition to these periodic reviews we score every restaurant based on a
mystery shopper program  unannounced anonymous visits by trained personnel
who rate the restaurants qsc performance according to their experience as
customers we also get input from our own staff at each restaurant by way of an
annual employee satisfaction survey

some business units around the world include a restaurant measure based on
customer comment for example in the us customers can provide feedback via
a tollfree number 18002446227 in 2006 we plan to establish a standard code
for the different types of customer comments we receive and incorporate customer
feedback into our roip restaurant performance measures on a global basis

 raised on a farm in alberta canada dr harvey anderson grew up under
 standing the importance of properly feeding the animals on which his family
 depended this ultimately led him to a career in human nutrition science
 dr anderson is currently professor of nutritional sciences physiology and
 medical sciences at the university of toronto he ﬁrst worked with mcdonalds
 in the late 80s and early 90s he has been a member of the mcdonalds global
 advisory council for balanced active lifestyles since its founding in 2003


as nutritionists we talk about energy balance a concept
 that most people still dont understand for the average
 person its simply maintaining body weight by having
 input equal output we also talk about the importance
 of lifestyle and we translate that into acts of increased
 activity like getting on a treadmill mcdonalds says yes
 thats a part of it but action is also about doing things
 dont just sit there  do something
theres a lot of skepticism out there         when i sign up with any company
 but mcdonalds really does care                 as a scientiﬁc advisor i tell them up
 about the health of children and the            front that if in two years i dont see
 consumer  thats one aspect the               were having any impact im done
 other aspect is the quality of the food        i wouldnt be with mcdonalds if i
 serving more than 45 or 50 million              didnt fully believe they care
 meals a day with such an outstanding
 food safety record is extraordinary

  corporate social responsibility fellowship assignment


  in the fall of 2005 mcdonalds invited students from the haas school
  of business at the university of california berkley to experience the
  mcdonalds system from the inside out  to get a full and unfettered
  look into our us beef supply chain the fellows pictured below
  committed to approaching their work with an objective eye and to
  listening and learning from all sides of the issues in return mcdonalds
  committed to providing open doors exposure to our system
  and to incorporating their efforts into our next worldwide corporate
           open
  responsibility report and so here it is  their report with their opinions
  this is open doors in action




 fork to farm represents our birdseye view of the supply chain as a retailer we work from the front
   counter back to the farm level and our ability to influence socially responsible policies and programs is
   reflective of this reality

m cdonald s responseto csr fellows report




response to csr fellows from dr catherine adams

first let me state how excited we were when the haas school of business at the university of california
berkley agreed to explore such an important and often misunderstood topic in keeping with our open
doors theme what better way to deliver on this promise than giving these csr fellows full and unrestricted
access to our system as well as our suppliers practices for raising cattle feedlots and meat packing
facilities we were pleased they were willing to take on this initiative and eagerly anticipated their ﬁndings
it is clear from their report that we delivered on our promise for an unvarnished look at our suppliers
practices for beef production we appreciate the candor of their report and the recommendations offered so
that both mcdonalds and the industry can continue to raise the bar

we were pleased to read that the csr fellows endorsed so many of our practices recognizing that our
industryleading efforts have changed practices relative to animal welfare the environment and people for
the better the fellows ﬁndings are heartening given just how strongly each of us at mcdonalds believes in
these principles they are the soul of the people of mcdonalds

and yet we also accept that there is more to do we take the recommendations in the csr fellows report
seriously and pledge to look into each one working with the meat industry and our best in class suppliers to
see what can become part of our evolving social responsibility agenda immediately and in the future while
mcdonalds buys a relatively small proportion of the worldwide beef consumption we have been impressed
at our success in changing industry practices directly and indirectly we recognize our ability to do more
and our responsibility to explore this potential

we only work with suppliers who are as committed as we are to protecting the land water air and the
animals that constitute our food supply we will strive to build on the excellent work of the csr fellows
and ask that you hold us accountable to this promise by providing updates on the progress we are making in
future reports

       food safety and quality




food safety our obsession

underlying all our social responsibility efforts is our fundamental commitment to
ensuring that the foods and beverages we serve our customers are safe
this means working with our suppliers to monitor test and track our ingredients

our food safety and quality standards meet or exceed government requirements
indeed our standards and procedures have been used by government agencies as
models for their own regulations we actively support strong sciencebased food
safety by sharing our experience and advocating for additional measures we believe
will help protect consumers and their trust in the safety of local food supplies
we view this as part of our responsibility as a good corporate citizen and we know
it is also essential to the continuing growth and proﬁtability of our business


specifying safe high quality beef patties

a good example of how closely we control our food sources is how we work with our
beef patty suppliers our product speciﬁcations for beef patties are eight pages
long and cover seven major categories ranging from maximum temperature of raw
materials as delivered through ﬁnal packing and delivery to distribution centers

the raw material category includes 30 speciﬁc standards including primary beef
processing requirements that we have established as ﬁrewalls against bse and
additional bserelated requirements for the beef processors sources the chief
standard is that our hamburger patties are 100 beef the standards also include an
extensive list of prohibited ingredients and defects including preservatives additives
and ﬁllers nonmeat parts and mechanically deboned meat  a potential source of
contamination with tissues that have been identiﬁed as high risk for transmitting bse

the speciﬁcations require beef suppliers to work under a validated hazardous
analysis critical control point haccp system and also include relevant
microbiological requirements

in addition the speciﬁcations establish attributes the patties must have when cooked
in our restaurants according to our established operating procedures these include
among others achieving a minimum internal temperature during cooking to ensure
safety and a maximum cooked temperature consistent with food quality


restaurant food safety training and procedures

food safety at the restaurant level is fully integrated throughout our system 
in our training programs our restaurant operations guidance and our restaurant
assessment processes

training in food safety begins the ﬁrst day an employee arrives for work with an
orientation to our standards and is incorporated into the curriculum templates
and materials that prepare employees for progressively advanced positions
the curriculum for shift managers includes an entire course in food safety which
they must successfully complete before being certiﬁed as capable of managing
a shift alone

the operations and training ot manual mcdonalds procedures reference
for restaurant operations includes an entire chapter on food safety it deﬁnes
requirements and provides speciﬁc guidance on the entire range of our restaurant
level food safety standards  from supply and delivery through storage preparation
and holding

            advocating for food safety beyond the arches

            mcdonalds is serious about promoting food safety around the world to this end for
            many years we have engaged with other food companies government agencies trade
            associations producer associations and consumer advocacy groups to help ensure
            safe food supplies we have also shared our experience with government agencies
            such as the us department of agriculture usda discussing haccp as well as
            other food safety issues in recent years our efforts have focused on beef safety
            and our partners have included not only the usda but also the us food and drug
            administration fda and food safety regulatory agencies in many other countries
            we have also worked on a range of food safety issues with the european food safety
            authority and the pan american health organization

            our 2004 worldwide corporate responsibility report summarizes our earlier bse
            related activities in the last two years we have focused on several critical measures
            to strengthen regulatory protections against bse we have strongly advocated
            signiﬁcant expansion of the existing fda feed ban so that it would more effectively
            keep cattle feed free of tissues that can carry bse we have also urged the usda to
            institute a mandatory animal identiﬁcation system so that the agencies  and beef
            suppliers  could rapidly trace an animals movements back to the likely source of any
            contagion in this context we have shared our experience with the longestablished
            mcdonalds europe traceability system and our more recent experience working
            with our suppliers to roll out a global system

            with this report we are taking a ﬁrst step to establish two kpis    impact on the brazilian economy 
            we will use to track economic impacts in our major markets          conducted in celebration of mcdonalds
            one kpi is capital expenditures  what we spend on purchases         25 years in brazil
            that have more than a year of useful life such as land and
            restaurant equipment in 2005 our capital expenditures
            in eight of our nine major markets totaled 114 billion  an
            increase of more than 21 over 2004

            the other kpi is amounts paid in social taxes these are the
            taxes that companies pay to support government programs that
            may provide beneﬁts for eligible company employees former
            employees and in some cases their families such as social
            security unemployment compensation and medicare in 2005
            our social tax payments totaled more than 382 million  an
            increase of about 97 over 2004

            key performance indicators                2004              2005

            capital expenditures             094 billion      114 billion

            total social taxes paid          3453 million   3823 million
            not including japan



            both capital investments and social taxes the income taxes
            paid by mcdonalds corporation play a signiﬁcant part in
            funding governmental programs that beneﬁt people other than
            our employees and shareholders as a responsible taxpayer
            mcdonalds corporation complies with the laws in the different
            jurisdictions where we do business to ensure that we pay our
            fair share of income tax income tax payments made by the nine
            major markets totaled 640 million in 2005 and 966 million in
            2004 these ﬁgures represent the income tax dollars paid which
            ultimately beneﬁt the people in the communities in which we do
            business via various government programs and services

            as local businesses mcdonalds restaurants contribute in many
            ways to economic development at local national and regional
            levels they provide jobs and the wages they pay enter the local
            economy as employees make purchases and pay taxes they
            provide opportunities for local and regional suppliers who then
            create jobs to meet the increased demand they invest in their
            communities through construction and renovation and may
            serve as a stimulus for neighborhood revitalization they pay
            taxes and fees and thus help support essential public services
            and not only their employees but their suppliers and their
            suppliers employees pay taxes too

                                                         each countrylevel business unit reported the total kwh used in 2004 and 2005 for
                                                         the restaurants it operated these country totals were based on various approaches
                                                         ranging from measured data for all restaurants in the case of germany to extrapolat

                                                         mcdonalds europe recently performed an assessment that indicated that the
                                                         majority of the ghg emissions produced by mcdonalds europe stem from the

                                                         and drew the conclusion that on a global level restaurants electricity consumption
                                                         accounts for the bulk of mcdonalds ghg emissions

measuring our efforts to control electrical energy use

we have taken a ﬁrst step toward developing a metric that will allow us to monitor our restaurants efforts
to control electrical energy use the initial kpi measures kilowatt hours used in relation to customer
transaction counts a transaction count is a customer order that results in a single payment it therefore
could account for one or more people depending on the size of the party and structure of payment

key performance indicator                                                               2004          2005

total kilowatt hours used per transaction count in companyoperated restaurants           085          085
 not including china us




we are not completely satisﬁed with this metric because it does not really reﬂect the multiple variables
that impact electrical energy consumption in our restaurants so much depends upon the local climate the
number of hours the restaurant is open for business its size construction type the types and ages of the
equipment it uses and of course the procedures in place to control energy use as we continue to develop
our understanding of how these various factors correlate with energy use we plan to strengthen our metric
to best reﬂect energy use by companyoperated restaurants in addition as we develop and reﬁne our data
collection procedures we will work to develop a more comprehensive metric that accounts for not only
electrical energy use but also other energy use
