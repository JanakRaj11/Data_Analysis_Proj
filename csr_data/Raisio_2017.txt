raisio annual report  operating environment  raisioagro



raisioagro is a feeding expert
raisioagros strength is its ability to innovate products that promote sustainable
development and meet customer needs feeding expertise and highquality feeds meeting
the farm needs improve the profitability of farms in line with objectives while ensuring
animal welfare

restructuring of milk farms continued in finland
despite the lowering number of finnish milk farms the number of dairy cows did not substantially decrease since
some of the farms carried out extension investments the key change impacting the feed market was that the
number of tmr feeding farms and robotic milking farms continued to grow tmr feeding means that all feed
components are mixed with silage and a cow is given only one feed mixture

as the challenging economic situation continued milk farms continued their shift to more affordable feeds of lower
added value the main reasons for the milk farmers challenging economic conditions are the russian ban on
imports of dairy products and the subsequent drop in the producer price of milk in finland

benemilk added value feeds are mainly used at the robotic milking farms where farmers are satisfied with the added
value they have received for their milk production at the end of 2016 some six per cent of all finnish dairy cows
were fed with benemilk feeds

raisioagro did not get involved in the aggressive price competition
but focused on extending the expertise of sales employees targeted
marketing developing of the product range corresponding customer
                                                                                        benemilk feeds have an

russias economic challenges and weakening liquidity of dairy farms
reduced raisioagros cattle feed sales to russia russia is investing
in its own milk chain which means that the need to improve the
quality of milk and to raise the yield levels will increase the demand for feeding expertise consultation due to its
advanced expertise raisioagro has a strong potential to increase its exports to russia

internet of farming is digital pioneering

cooperation with fish farmers as well as on sustainable innovations
which have significantly reduced the environmental impacts from

improved and the unemployment rate trend is downward in finland the economy is expected to grow moderately in
2017 supported by domestic demand

although brexit is causing uncertainty the uks economic growth is expected to continue and employment and
earnings are estimated to develop positively

the uks vote to leave the eu and related exit negotiations are
creating uncertainty in the food industrys operating conditions and
longterm business planning changes in the pound to euro
                                                                                        a large portion of raisios

directly and indirectly as a significant portion of the groups net                    generated in the uk
sales and ebit is generated in the uk

volatility in the roubles external value affects the exports of feeds
and oat products to russia and may also have an impact on the utilisation rates of production plants in finland

the price and availability of agricultural raw materials are a major challenge for raisios businesses global warming
and extreme weather events rapidly affect the crop expectations supply demand and price of these commodities
in addition changes in supply demand availability and price of other key raw materials are possible in terms of
business profitability the role of risk management remains essential both for value and volume

in europe various health taxes are discussed and related initiatives are being set up sugar may be one of the
taxed raw materials in case these initiatives result in new taxes they will probably affect raisios operations

thorough investigation the finnish patent authority determined that the benemilk innovation meets the criteria for

benemilk innovation were filed in january 2012

furthermore patent authorities in new zealand examined the patent applications and granted patents for the

so far benemilk has been granted patents in finland new zealand australia and south africa which is a strong
indication of the patentability of the innovation in various markets now that the first important patents have been
received raisio will not publicly analyse the benemilk patent portfolio

business operations
in november 2015 benemilk ltd launched a process to examine the conditions and opportunities to obtain new
financing based on the completed assessment benemilk ltds board of directors concluded in june 2016 that it is
not justified to implement the equity financing scheme as the company valuation indicated by potentially interested
investors was not satisfactory for owners

benemilk ltds operations were significantly reduced in the autumn 2016 and the investment to internationally
commercialise the innovation was minimised in accordance with the decision taken by raisios board of directors in
august global crisis in the milk market as well as potential customers unwillingness to change their feeding models
affected the decision and for these reasons the companys shortterm prospects for the international expansion of
the business were not favourable the office in seattle usa was closed

raisio annual report  sustainable food chain  responsible procurement




responsible procurement
promotes sustainability of the food
chain
quality safety and responsibility are the key criteria for raisios raw material
procurement raisios consumers and customers are increasingly interested in the
traceability of product raw materials and in the production in line with sustainable
development as an expert in animal feeding and healthy foods raisio has an ability and
opportunity to promote the sustainable food chain with its raw material choices

main events in 2016
       raisio harmonised its responsible procurement practices the groups common supplier code of conduct
       will be introduced in all our businesses during 2017
       healthy snacks business prepared its transfer to the use of utz certified cocoa
       at the nokia mill raisio decided to get the rspo supply chain certificate and it will enter into force in the
       spring 2017

raisios value chain is part of the sustainable food chain all the companys raw materials are renewable raisios
key raw materials are grains wheat oats rye barley and rapeseed these account for some 70 per cent of all raw
materials raisioagros share of the groups all raw materials is almost 70 per cent key raw materials in the feed

raisio annual report  sustainable food chain  responsible procurement

manufacturing are wheat barley and rapeseed

raisio has almost 80 years of experience in contract farming and the company acquires 85 per cent of its grain
directly from farmers raisios grain products are largely made in finland and the grain transport distance from the
producer to the factory is on average less than 100 kilometres

subcontractors manufacture part of raisios branded products quality criteria for the raw materials used in contract
manufacturing are defined in the agreements raisio acquires raw materials for part of its finnish subcontractors

raisio secures the responsibility of raw materials by requiring its suppliers to commit to the supplier code of
conduct regarding for example human rights working conditions in accordance with international regulations
environmental responsibility and anticorruption

certified raw materials
to secure the responsibility of soy palm oil and cocoa raisio has drawn up policies regarding the use of certified
raw materials

soy accounts for about one per cent of all raw materials and the company uses it mainly for fish feeds all the soy
raisio used in feeds is either proterra or rtrs certified raisio is a member of the round table on responsible
soy association

since 2014 all the palm oil used in raisios foods has been responsible in 2016 70 per cent of the palm oil used in
raisios foods was physically traceable mass balance or segregated and 30 per cent was green palm certified
our longterm goal is to transfer to the use of physically traceable palm oil in food products palm oil accounts for
less than one per cent of all raisios raw materials raisio is a member of the roundtable on sustainable palm oil

raisios goal is that the cocoa used in its own branded products is certified by the end of 2018 this does not
however apply to the confectionery since major part of the confectionery is produced for contract partners who
themselves define the certification requirements of raw materials during 2016 we were preparing the transfer to
the use of certified cocoa and the first products containing certified cocoa will be available in 2017 cocoa accounts
for less than 05 per cent of all raw materials of our branded products

origin of the fishmeal and oil used in fish feeds is always known and no endangered fish species are used in the
manufacturing of our feeds

certified raw materials account for some four per cent of all raisios raw materials in addition to certified palm oil
and soy raisio uses for example small amounts of organic oats and other organic grains

objectives for 20162018
       we will further develop the responsible procurement of our key raw materials raw materials that we use the
       most include grains particularly oats and wheat and rapeseed
       we require our suppliers to operate in accordance with our supplier code of conduct
       we expect the suppliers to complete the supplier selfassessment questionnaire at least every three years
       we continue to purchase proterra or rtrs certified soy

       the uk confectionery business is involved in the climate change act aiming to reduce energy consumption

raisio reports on the environmental impact arising from its production raisios operations cause environmental
impacts throughout the life cycle of products in 2016 raisio had nine production plants in finland the uk and
czech republic our environmental efficiency development is goaloriented particularly in energy and material
efficiency

the company invests in renewable energy raisio started building a bioenergy plant in its industrial area the plant
will be completed during the spring 2017 as a result the carbon footprint of raisios production plants will decrease
significantly as at the same time the company will discontinue its use of coalbased industrial steam

raisio operates in accordance with rules and regulations no environmental damages were identified in the groups
offices and the group received no fines or sanctions for violations of environmental legislation in 2016

raisios production plants are not located in protected areas or in areas of high biodiversity value or in their
immediate vicinity

results 2016
       environmental investments were carried out to enhance energy production and consumption waste reduction
       and wastewater treatment
       in the fish feed production heat recovery was renewed which improved the energy use
       in the production of cholesterollowering benecol ingredient a new operating model resulted in significant
       energy savings
       the groups energy consumption per produced product tonne decreased by four per cent
       the amount of landfill waste declined by 62 per cent the amount of recovered waste increased to 94 per
       cent investments and improvements in the equipment contributed to the results
       raisios product packages are mainly made of recycled material


objectives for 20162018
       we will enhance our energy use
       we will perform energy audits at all our production plants at least every two years
       we will analyse material efficiency in terms of raw materials and other production inputs we will decrease
       waste at our production plants
       we will only use recyclable materials in our product packages
       we continue to develop and commercialise innovations that benefit the environment and our customers

raisio annual report  sustainable food chain  environmental impact



raisios environmental impact
raw materials and material efficiency
raw materials used in raisios products are renewable the companys goal is a materialefficient use of raw
materials to achieve this all the groups production plants have drawn up plans material efficiency is promoted
particularly through the development of monitoring and reporting

raw material use at raisios production plants decreased by over three per cent and per tonne of product by one
per cent

recoverable waste accounts for more than 94 per cent of the total waste the amount of landfill waste declined by
62 per cent from the previous year the amount of hazardous waste decreased by 38 per cent and that of total
waste by two per cent

scope of reporting in terms of raw material use finnish production plants are reported for 2013  2016 while the
groups continuous operations are reported for 2015  2016 landfill waste is reported for the whole groups
continuous operations water use for products is not included in the raw material quantities shown below




water
water use is an important environmental factor at raisio as water is needed in production and cooling processes
water use is monitored continuously and water is recycled effectively furthermore we actively examine means to
decrease water use

household water use increased by 14 per cent in the group despite various enhancement measures a number of
pipeline leaks in the uk resulted in the increase in the groups water use in finland household water use
decreased by over four per cent

the amount of wastewater increased by six per cent in the group while decreased significantly in finland

emissions from energy production
raisio reports direct greenhouse emissions of its own energy production and indirect emissions of purchased
energy as co2e values emissions generated in raisios production are calculated while for the purchased energy
emissions are defined as co2e values of emissions reported by suppliers carbon dioxide equivalent co2e
describes the total climate warming effect of greenhouse gases

the groups electricity is purchased energy electricity that raisio buys in finland is ecolabelled and its production
does not cause greenhouse gas emissions electricity purchased in finland accounts for almost 60 per cent of the
groups electricity use

the uk and czech production plants produce heat from natural gas in finland our thermal energy is purchased
with the exception of the kouvola plant that has a steam boiler plant using natural gas in raisios industrial area
there is a power plant operating as a reserve plant it will be closed during the spring 2017 when the new bioenergy
plant is completed

raisio continues its work to improve energy efficiency and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions

raisio annual report  sustainable food chain  case leading through information results in more sustainable milk
production




leading through information
results in more sustainable milk
production
modern barns generate plenty of information that results in more
profitable and sustainable milk production internet of farming also
reduces the environmental impact of milk production

milk increasingly comes from freestall barns where one or several
milking robots take care of the milking a robot generates a large amount of data on for example the cows milking
activeness and production phase raisioagro developed a milking robot monitoring service so that the information
gathered could be used more effectively

monitoring service is meant for farms using robotic milking realtime data on the yields feeding and health of dairy
cows is gathered raisioagros experts analyse the data and prepare a report for the producer who can then
optimise the feeding improve milk yield and enhance economic profitability of the farm this service is a concrete
example of the opportunities offered by the internet of farming

the development of the service started in 2015 together with a few farms and milking robot manufacturers with the
innovation the aim is to create added value through feeding plans and feeds as well as through specialists and
investments made in a milking robot

cattle welfare in focus

raisio annual report  sustainable food chain  case leading through information results in more sustainable milk
production
raisioagros monitoring service uses cowspecific information gathered by the milking robot based on the data it is
possible to monitor for example the impacts of changed feeding on yield as well as their effects on the relationship
between milk yield and feed costs the report provides results regarding the entire cattle while it is also possible to
follow the yields of different animal groups or individual cows

only healthy cows produce a lot of milk with the data analysis it is
possible to closely monitor the cows wellbeing quickly detect
anomalies and make necessary feeding changes

kilograms are reduced

already more than 130 dairy farms almost 15 per cent of the
finnish robotic milking farms use the monitoring service with very positive results the energycorrected milk yields
of the farms involved have grown by 65 per cent on average resulting in higher producer milk income

raisioagro is the strongest finnish expert in the use of internet of farming the company continues to further
develop its milking robot monitoring and other services using digitalisation

raisio annual report  sustainable food chain  case the feed innovation baltic blend made fish farming more
sustainable




the feed innovation baltic blend
made fish farming more
sustainable
since june 2016 the innovation baltic blend has
been used in all raisioaqua feeds fish meal and oil
made of the baltic sea fish are used as raw
materials for the baltic blend feeds when the fish
farmed in the baltic sea area are fed using local
feeds nutrients are recycled and not brought to the
baltic sea from outside with baltic blend the
environmental impact of raisioaquas feed customers will be significantly lower as the
phosphorus load from fish farming turns negative and the nitrogen load is reduced to a
fraction of what it was before

nutrient recycling is one of the pillars of sustainable food chain until now fishmeal and oil made of the fish from the
worlds oceans have been used also in the finnish fish feeds now they can be replaced by fishmeal and oil made of
the baltic sea fish this way nutrients will not be brought to the baltic sea from outside

with raisioaquas innovation baltic blend the same amount or even more phosphorus and nitrogen is removed in
the form of herring used for fishmeal production from the baltic sea than generated from the farming according to

raisio annual report  sustainable food chain  case the feed innovation baltic blend made fish farming more
sustainable
the natural resources institute finland strong herring and sprat stocks in the baltic sea are considered
sustainable so the local feed production is not harmful to natural fish stocks

a significant reduction in the baltic sea nutrient loading
a total of 13000000 kg of fish a year is farmed in finland the feeding earlier based on raw materials brought from
the worlds oceans has produced 60000 kg of phosphorus load and 507000 kg of nitrogen load each year when
the baltic sea feed baltic blend is introduced significant nutrient load reductions will be achieved on an annual
basis phosphorus will be reduced by 75000 kg and nitrogen by 377000 kg so sustainable fish farming will
decrease the nutrient load in the baltic sea

raisioaqua has also developed a feeding concept hercules opti allowing the replacement of fish oil used in fish
feeding by rapeseed oil while maintaining high levels of omega3 fatty acids of fish already from 2009 the hercules
feeds contain phytase enzyme due to the enzyme the phosphorus load into the water system decreased by 26 per
cent

feeds have a significant impact on the sustainability of fish farming wwf finland added finnish farmed rainbow
trout on the green list of its seafood guide in 2014 and finnish farmed whitefish in 2016 several raisios fish feed
innovations have reduced the environmental impacts of fish farming
