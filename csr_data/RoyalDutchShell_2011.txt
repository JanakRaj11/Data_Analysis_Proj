        oil sands
        canadas oil sands are one of the worlds
        largest potential sources of crude oil
        if developed responsibly they can make
        an increasing contribution to meeting the
        worlds energy needs but developing
        and processing oil sands is energy and
        water intensive

        at our oil sands operations we are tackling
        these challenges by finding ways to
        improve our energy efficiency and limit
        freshwater use through recycling we
        are also working to develop a largescale
        carbon capture and storage ccs project
        we work with neighbouring communities
        supporting local and aboriginal businesses
        by the end of 2010 we had contracted
        nearly 1 billion of business to aboriginal
        companies since 2005 we also work

        the arctic
        the arctic could be essential to meeting
        growing demand for energy in the future
        it holds as much as 30 of the worlds
        undiscovered natural gas and around 13
        of its yettofind oil according to the us
        geological survey of these resources
        about 84 lie offshore we have plans to
        explore in the beaufort and chukchi seas
        off north alaska in the near future

        the arctics environment is already
        undergoing change due to global warming
        it is home to indigenous peoples who

           shell  has been applying business thinking models and disciplines to tackle key              and 6 million in funding to help
           development challenges it has created several successful partnerships and                     build a cleanerburning cookstoves

           all of shell foundations partners strive for financial self sufficiency aiming to generate
           enough income to break the reliance on grant funding they all plan to expand their            cookstoves that burn fuel more
           operations and extend their benefits to the maximum number of people they also                efficiently significantly reduce fuel
           work very closely with shell foundation staff to develop their business knowledge and          use and harmful emissions with our
           strategies                                                                                    alliance partners we are working to

           another good example of the way shell foundation operates is in the area of                    for cleanerburning stoves we are
           sustainable transport in the last 20 years the urban population of the developing world       also focusing on raising awareness of

           in 2002 shell foundation and the world resources institute created embarq a                    using cleanerburning cookstoves in india
           global network of transport experts that creates sustainable ways to overcome local
           transport problems these include bus rapid transit brt systems retrofitting existing
           buses with environmental improvements and developing cycling and pedestrian
           routes as well as transport safety measures in mexico city for example a 20 km brt
           corridor  the networks first initiative  now serves 500000 passengers a day halving
           previous travel times for its passengers embarq has expanded its operations to run
           projects in 22 cities around the world and has attracted 880 million in investment
           more than one billion passengers have benefitted and it is estimated that the scheme
           has saved 720000 tonnes of co2

           in 2010 shell foundation released a new report enterprise solutions to scale to
           highlight lessons learned from successes and failures the report aims to encourage
           transparency among organisations engaged in similar work so that lessons may be

        a	petroleum industry guidelines for greenhouse gas estimate december 2003 api ipieca ogp indicate that uncertainty in greenhouse gas measurements can be
             significant depending on the methods used co2 equivalent is a term used to express the total emissions of the major greenhouse gases including co2 methane
             nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons in 1998 we set a voluntary target for 2010 of 5 lower direct ghg emissions from facilities we operate than our comparable
             1990 level direct ghg emissions for the 1990 base year for our major facilities have been adjusted in accordance with the requirements of iso 140641 it has not
             been technically feasible to determine the 1990 emissions for some recent acquisitions we have updated our 2009 figures following recalculation of the data
        b	the rise in flaring emissions in 2010 is primarily due to increased production in nigeria as well as inclusion of flaring in iraq following the start of our production
             contract with the iraqi government in 2010 flaring in iraq amounted to 03 million tonnes of hydrocarbon in 2010 we have updated our 2009 figures following
             recalculation of the data
        c	data reported in accordance with ipieca guidelines we have updated our 2008 and 2009 figures following recalculation of the data
        d	we have updated the last five years of data to reflect the operation of cogeneration facilities the data includes mining and upgrading operations it does not include
             in situ production
        e	we have indexed our refinery energy intensity data to the year 2002 this allows for easier comparison of current performance to our starting point the index is
             based upon the solomon associates energy intensity index 2006 methodology
        f all spill volumes and numbers are for spills over 100 kilograms
        g we have updated our 2009 figures following completion of investigations to confirm spill volumes
        h all sabotage and theft related spills have occurred in nigeria except in 2007 07 thousand tonnes outside nigeria and 2006 06 thousand tonnes outside nigeria
        i	we have updated our 2009 figure following review of the data the number of operational spills reported for the years 2004 and 2005 also contain a small number
             of hurricane spills
        j we have updated our 2007 figure following review of our data and portfolio
