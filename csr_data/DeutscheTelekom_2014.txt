innovations in the area of health are only a few examples with our tele
medical solutions we make it possible for people who are ill and in
need of care to be monitored remotely so that they can continue to live          timotheus höttges chairman of the board of management bonn germany

   of supply chain management

 expansion of the ngo radar to include further relevant stakeholder
   groups and consideration of the assessment in the materiality pro
   cess

expansion of the groupwide management function for sustainability
eg

 further development of the documentation for central and local pro
   cesses with the aim of ensuring that the main process steps for
   determination and internal controls of all cr kpis contained in the
   report are defined

 development of clear unambiguous definitions of the performance
   indicators for supply chain management and further formalization of

global esustainability initiative

new revised social charter published
telekom expressed its commitment to ethical corporate governance in
its social charterwhich was introduced ten years ago the charter was
revised and complemented in 2013 one of the reasons for this was to
align it with the united nations guiding principles on business and
human rights the core of our social charter however remains
unchanged it specifies the working conditions and social standards
under which our products and services are produced and offered the
social charter is a behavioral guideline for all of our employees inves
tors customers and suppliers

rights issues and the setup of a point of contact for internal and external
inquiries on human rights telekom is also committed to using its tech

environmental protection furthermore it explicitly specifies employee
rights to protection against disciplinary measures

methods in most cases and maintain consistent reporting processes
over several years to make it possible to compare values we are plan
ning to begin thoroughly reviewing our cr kpis in 2014 and integrate
new cr kpis into our data collection process were necessary despite
these adjustments we plan to continue to report on the current cr kpis
so that our readers will be able to compare the available data

cr kpi reporting in the annual report
since 2013 the drs20 german accounting standard has specified that
managementrelevant nonfinancial kpis be included in forecast
reporting from a cr standpoint we are very pleased with this develop
ment that is why we made a qualitative statement regarding 2014 and
2015 trends for the most important cr kpis in our 2013 annual report
with the goal of further integrating our financial and cr reports the
statement applies to the energy consumption co2 emissions and sus

the number and complexity of rating inquiries involving cr continued

to keep the workload involved at a manageable level in coordinating

insight into the rating procedures to enable us to better identify and
address optimization potential in the company from the viewpoint of
external stakeholders our goal is to always come out at the top
creating a basis for inclusion in key sustainability indexes

integrated reporting
we are currently seeing an international trend toward integrating finan

bility activities such as environmental protection employee concerns
and green products are increasingly being included in traditional

dialog expectations
while developing our strategy we asked our stakeholders about their
expectations regarding our dialog activities to help us organize our sta
keholder relationships to the satisfaction of all parties involved the
results clearly showed that we need to methodically include our stake
holders in our efforts to achieve the quality leadership to which we
aspire the majority of our stakeholders expect

 mandatory rules
 practical opportunities to help codesign our activities
 goals that are clearly defined at the start of each dialog process
 information on how the results are being implemented

the evaluation also showed that our involvement principles already lar
gely fulfill our stakeholders expectations we particularly feel that our
stakeholders agree with our conviction that stakeholder involvement
requires dialog on an equal footing

systematic cr topic monitoring
we place considerable emphasis on tracking the development of those
topics that our stakeholders consider relevant in the context of the cr
topic monitoring process which is part of our cr management system

cr market research
to be able to focus our cr activities effectively it is important to deter
mine how these are perceived and assessed by our stakeholders we
conduct regular studies to help us do thisuntil 2012 assessments were
based on separate cr market research

in 2013 we integrated the questions on sustainability social commit
ment and the supply chain into our crqi corporate reputation quality
indicator group survey in this survey we ask private individuals about
how they perceive our company and how they feel about topics relevant
to society the study which is conducted by a wellknown opinion
research institute is based on a representative sample of private
households

the findings from this market research form the basis along with other
criteria of our social commitment cr kpi it determines the public per
ception of telekoms cr activities as a ratio of the general perception of
how important it is for companies to get involved in social issues the
social commitment cr kpi shows that in 2013 our performance was
rated significantly higher than the level of importance attached by the
public to the subject we did however make some modifications in
2013 compared to the previous year in terms of the focus of the survey
and how it was evaluated we are planning to review this cr kpi in
2014

mers and employees participated the media suppliers ngos and sci

the procedure
participants from different areas of the company attended the internal
workshop and discussed the significance that cr focal topics have in
relation to telekoms core business they rated the topics for the diffe
rent sections of the cr report on a scale ranging from absolutely
essential to not essential the results were submitted to our stakehol
ders in the survey that followed we asked them to review the rating and
make any changes they felt were necessary before they got started we
asked them which cr topics they were currently most interested in how
relevant these were to telekom and which topics they thought the com
pany should be most involved in

our stakeholders personal focal topics
75 out of 88 people surveyed 85 percent filled out the open response
box climate protection and human rights topics as well as the supply
chain and data privacy were the topics most frequently named by those
surveyed these topics were rated as very important to deutsche
telekoms success

those surveyed listed 143 topics in response to the additional question
which topics they thought telekom should be most involved in some of
these were listed repeatedly these included data privacy and data
security climate and climate protection sustainability along the supply
chain human rights the environment recycling and education

internal rating of all topics confirmed
the results of the online survey confirmed the majority of the rating
results from the telekom workshop there were slight deviations from
the internal assessment of some topics but no impact on overall results
a few topics received mixed stakeholder ratings in the survey

this review of the results of our internal workshop helped us compare
internal and external points of view as well as expectations the respon
ses we received to our open questions confirmed that we are on the
right path

tsystems international
our cr highlight optimizing and consolidating data centers
reducing co2 emissions is a key component in deutsche telekoms cr
activities operation and planning of tsystems data centers plays a sig
nificant role in our efforts we work to reduce our co2 emissions by
making improvements at individual data centers as well as optimizing
our global data center landscape

we thoroughly optimized current data center sites from 2008 to 2013
some examples include updating the cooling systems and installing
cold aisle containment to control the flow of cooling air as needed and
minimize cold air waste in the it areas in this context upgrading our it
systems and migrating the application environments to this new techno
logy contributed considerably to the improved energy efficiency that we
achieved in the years 2008 to 2013 the pue factor power usage effec
tiveness is the globally recognized indicator in the it industry used to
measure energy efficiency the indicator compares the total amount of
energy used at a data center to the amount of energy used by it sys
tems and equipment this value can be calculated for each data center
our average pue factor improved from 185 to 164 the lower the
value the lower the amount of energy being consumed by infrastructure
components at a data center

we also work to improve efficiency by physically consolidating our data
centers we do this by reducing data center space and number of loca
tions and by using logical consolidation ie via virtualization with its
dc112018 program tsystems is working to globally consolidate
data center sites with the latest it technology to a few fmo future mode
of operation data centers we expect these measures to massively
reduce co2 emissions according to the latest plans the program
should cut co2 emissions in half by 2020

why corporate responsibility matters to our company
                                 we feel that reducing energy consump
                                 tion is key when it comes to reducing
                                 our co2 emissions thats why we have
                                 been systematically optimizing the car
                                 bon footprint of our data centers since
                                 2008 we are planning to cut our data
                                 center co2 emissions in half by 2020 by
consolidating our data centers worldwide and increasing our use of vir
tualization technology for us green it isnt the future  its what we do

our cr highlight solar sunflowers at elementary schools
in march 2013 hrvatski telekom launched and financed the solar sun
flowers project with a donation of approx 53000 eur hrk 400000
the project was implemented in cooperation with the united nations
development program undp as a result elementary schools throug
hout croatia have been equipped with a solar tracker solar sun
flower a freestanding solar system that tracks the sun throughout the
day so that solar modules are positioned at an optimal angle to the sun
this boosts system efficiency by approx 30 percent and thus increases
the amount of energy produced
the idea behind the project is to educate children about renewable
sources of energy and in particular solar and wind energy by enabling
them to see how much energy is being produced by each solar sun
flower in a given hour day or year they also learn about the energy that
can be generated from river currents tides and waves as well as geo
thermal and biomass energy

our awards
 for the project solar sunflowers hrvatski telekom received dts

why corporate responsibility matters to our company
                      nowadays stakeholders expect more from a
                      company than a good bottom line  responsibility
                      that goes beyond the main goal of staying profita
                      ble and functional in macedonia these expecta
                      tions are even more pronounced when it comes
                      to large companies that record high profits on
                      their balance sheet hence as one of the most
                      significant players in the macedonian business
                      environment it is very important for makedonski

why corporate responsibility matters to our company
                        corporate responsibility in a company is an

our cr highlight sale and reuse of electrical and electronic
equipment
since 2012 tsystems iberia has not been selling any electrical and
electronic equipment as a result the amount of electrical and electro
nic waste has been reduced during 2013 for example 335 laptops
were donated to a supplier which resulted in a reduction of 1340 kg
in waste

in 2012 tsystems iberia also began selling redundant electrical and
electronic equipment from its data centers to a supplier who is required
to use any suitable spares in maintaining the companys equipment so
the supplier is turning redundant equipment into repairable spares and
the company is reducing the amount of waste generated in data centers
annually by approx 90 per cent related to previous years cost savings
are being achieved in the fields of spare parts storage and waste
management

why corporate responsibility matters to our company
                     we continue to work on a comprehensive pro
                     gram to embed corporate responsibility in our
                     company cr contributes to the integral improve
                     ment of the quality of management in the com
                     pany and also helps to achieve a more positive
                     role in the eyes of all its stakeholders and indeed
                     society we firmly believe that the practice of cr
                     can strengthen the competitiveness of the natio
nal economy and the capacity for development

in the current context and in light of trends in the field of the sustainabi
lity in spain the integration of the cr into the management of the com
pany contributes to building a sustainable economy society and envi
ronment on the other hand the nature of the companys business is a
clear guarantee of our commitment to sustainability

this commitment to sustainability is reflected among other actions in
our solutions for example the cloud solutions in which we have over
seven years of experience these seven years of experience indicate
that our commitments are not marked by fashion trends and are not
superficial we did not merely take up these commitments in the recent
past but rather they are the result of an awareness of sustainability that
we have been putting into practice for nearly a decade in this context
tsystems iberia can play an important role in the promotion of a new
economic model based on innovation and can thus be part of the solu
tion

evaluating the emf policy and implementing
recommendations for improvement
the results of our regular monitoring activities reflect our progress when
it comes to putting our emf policy fully into practice in all action areas
the policy was fully implemented in croatia and the federal republic of
macedonia during the reporting period as well

it is important to keep in mind however that our emf policy is not static
but leaves considerable room for flexibility within this framework our
national companies that have already fully implemented our emf policy
continue to improve their measures the telekom national companies
share their experiences with each other as well as with other network
providers and interact with associations consumers politicians and sci
entists all of these activities play a central role in their efforts

our primary goal in 2014 is again to make sure the emf policy is put
into practice in its entirety at every national company we will also conti
nue in our efforts to further optimize current measures in each country
some examples include better transparency about our mobile commu
nications stations and more effective interaction with local communities

implementation of the emf policy
during the reporting period telekom engaged in a number of measures
at the international level to implement its emf policy we have included
a few examples of these activities in the table below

social and environmental principles how we require our suppliers to
comply with these principles and how this is monitored through the use
of practices such as audits

the cr clause expressly refers to current internal standards the code
of conduct and telekoms social charter and enforces their applicabi
lity for suppliers and subsuppliers working with our group the clause
gives telekom the right to demand that suppliers provide information on
human rights labor and environmental standards as well as on activities
they are conducting to fight corruption and fraud within their sphere of
responsibility and influence it also gives telekom the right to review the
accuracy of this information every time a supplier signs an agreement
with telekom they also place themselves under the obligation to use
concrete measures to prevent and fight corruption to make the goods
and services they supply to telekom more environmentally friendly and
energy efficient and to provide information on the materials they use

ways that are energyefficient                                                as possible by that time

the board of managements approval of the climate target includes the
implementation of tools for central monitoring and management as well
as a consistent enhancement of the climate strategy identifying further
efficiency potential investing in climate projects eg modeled after the
kyoto mechanisms and increased use of electricity from renewable
energy sources are all interesting ways to achieve an ongoing reduction
of co2 emissions

the individual companies will contribute in varying degrees to the
achievement of our groupwide climate protection target contributions
will be based on countryspecific market and business trends and
expansion scenarios eg expansion of mobile communications net
works data center consolidation as well as other climaterelated and
geographic factors that might have an impact on the energy efficiency
measures

the board representative for climate protection and sustainability will
be responsible for the achievement and enhancement of our climate
protection target he will also ensure that the board of management is
updated on target progress in an annual status report

progress in measuring emissions along the supply
chain
scope 3 emissions are generated for instance by our employees on
their way to work or by our customers when they use our products we
are already reducing these scope 3 emissions for example by issuing
our staff with discount season tickets for the use of public transporta
tion the extent of these emissions is reflected in the fact that on their
way to work alone our employees in germany generate a volume of
co2 emissions representing around 12 percent of our entire scope 1
and 2 emissions

in 2013 we made progress with the measurement of these scope 3
emissions we can now calculate 10 out of 15 categories in the ghg
protocol which we have rated relevant for our company our object is
to report all our main scope 3 emissions we should achieve this in
germany in 2014 and for the group overall in 2016

house gases wherever possible the second priority is to reduce the
amount generated where emissions cannot be avoided we invest in
certified climate protection projects to compensate for some of the co2
emissions that we are unable to avoid or reduce

from early march 2013 to late february 2014 telekom compensated
for 11333 metric tons of co2 emissions these included emissions
associated with our events participant travel to and from the event

one way we do this is by providing financial support to a biogas project

standard the strictest requirements for emission reduction projects
worldwide and 70 percent comply with the voluntary carbon standard
which is recognized internationally as well
