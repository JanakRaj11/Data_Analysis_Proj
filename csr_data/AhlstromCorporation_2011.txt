    we use the terms specialty nonwoven and specialty paper throughout this report this is what they mean

    a nonwoven is made from fibers filaments or yarns that have been formed into a web and bonded together by
    any method other than weaving they contain synthetic fibers though the amount used varies depending on the
    product nonwovens are used for example in medical materials like surgical gowns filters in industrial products like
    flooring and car panels and everyday household items like baby wipes and tea bags

    specialty papers are made from 100 renewable fibers which are selected for their particular characteristics
    according to the use to be made of the end product these include for example food packaging release liners
    labels and wallpapers

    ahlstrom is the worlds leading producer of both specialty nonwovens and specialty papers

    this is the first time ahlstrom has issued a standalone sustainability report but this way of
    thinking has been an integral part of the way weve run our business for 160 years weve
    always believed in a proper balance between economic social and environmental
    priorities the products we make improve the quality of peoples lives and some are vital
    to modern medical procedures many of them also help both individuals and businesses
    live and operate more sustainably by reducing their emissions and cutting their energy
    consumption this is what we mean by products with purpose

    developing products like these is the most obvious way we put our principles into practice
    weve also made real progress in improving our own sustainability performance by using
    less energy and water and producing less waste per product which in turn makes us a more
    costefficient business just over 82 percent of the fiber raw materials we use now come from
    renewable sources

    this report will show you what weve achieved so far and the challenges were facing going
    forwards its part of the ongoing dialogue were having with our stakeholders on the whole
    idea of responsible business one of our values is learning and renewal and in that spirit
    we aim to share our own thinking on sustainability as openly as possible we want to invite
    everyone with an interest in our company to offer their own point of view from customers
    to employees to local communities near our sites

    were proud of what were doing to make ahlstrom a more sustainable business for the              we aim to share our own thinking
    future but were also very much aware that this is work in progress because the issues          on sustainability as openly as possible
    are constantly evolving and public and customer expectations change with them our
    commitment is to work hard to make a positive difference and i know all my colleagues
                                                                                                      we want to invite everyone with an

where do we      south america now supplies the vast majority of the worlds hardwood pulp and we buy most of
                 our own supplies there there are good reasons to do this both commercial and environmental for
                 example the forest area required to supply a millionton pulp mill in brazil is only 100000 hectares

source our       compared to 720000 in the nordic countries no renewable crop is more efficient than this likewise
                 eucalyptus trees can be harvested within seven years compared to 3540 years for scandinavian

hardwood pulp   birch and 7080 years for finnish pine

                 planted forests cover 6 million hectares or 07 percent of the total land area of brazil these forests
                 absorb around a billion tons of co2 per year close to half or 27 million hectares of forest are fully
                 certified with fsc and some also doublecertified with pefc cerflor all the eucalyptus we buy is
                 from these areas which like all eucalyptus plantations are located on marginal land which supports
                 the growth of other crops and does not compete with them no rainforest is cut to make room for
                 eucalyptus trees which are grown on degraded land that can serve no other agricultural purpose
                 using pulpwood from plantations like this puts less pressure on natural forests these plantations also
                 support much needed social and economic development in these neighborhoods and are providing
                 thousands of local jobs

are there alternatives to oilbased
chemicals
              with increasing competition for scarce oil reserves industries like ours are investing heavily in alternatives to
              oilbased polymers like those we use for the vast majority of our synthetic fibers weve been actively exploring
              new biopolymers for years and were a pioneer in the development and use of polylactic acid or pla which is
              a renewable polymer derived from corn secondgeneration biopolymers are now being made from renewable
              sources like sugarcane but these are not yet widely available

              biopolymers have great potential to reduce our dependence on oil and minimize our environmental impacts
              but they raise complex issues too many people question for example whether land should be used for
              biopolymer production when it could be used to grow food in our view the first problem to address here is food
              waste up to 70 percent of the worlds food production is lost at some point in the chain from field to refrigerator
              and the eu has estimated that household losses in its region alone are over 40 percent if this level of waste
              could be reduced there would be far less pressure on agricultural land

              third generation biopolymers could provide an even more sustainable longterm solution if a way can
              eventually be found to produce these from biomass waste pulp mill or agricultural or algae there would no
              longer be any competition with food crops

waste reduction is an ongoing process




                                                                4 maintain the condition                          2 create strategies

             doing more with less
             being more efficient with natural resources is the right thing to do but as those resources become more
             and more scarce it will soon become an unavoidable necessity the successful companies of the future
             will be those who can anticipate this change and turn it to competitive advantage

             our plan is to reduce our total production waste by a total of 2 percentage points in 2010 and 2011
             this may not sound like a huge amount but it would translate into a saving of over eur 20 million of raw
             materials and energy every year we use a technique called material balance analysis to assess how
             much raw material were using compared with an ideal level of consumption we then look at every
             stage of the manufacturing process to see where waste is occurring and reduce it this is a new and
             more rigorous approach to waste reduction which well be using in all our plants by the end of 2011

             were also working more collaboratively with our customers to make sure products are not unnecessarily
             overspecified which helps us make better use of our manufacturing plants cutting waste is an ongoing
             task and each time an improvement is achieved we start looking for the next one




                                                                                                                                          29

     good safety is
     good business

     nothing is more important to us than the safety
     of our employees and our environment every
     employee has the right to return home at the end
     of the working day as fit and healthy as when
     they left nor should the work we do harm the
     environment in which our plants operate this is not
     only the right thing to do but the best and most
     costeffective way to run our business

how will we meet tomorrows
challenges
             according to the most recent forecasts the earths population is projected to grow from 7 billion in 2011
             to over 9 billion people by 2050 adapting to such a huge increase in population will be an enormous
             challenge especially as the world is already starting to see shortages in key resources like food water
             and energy and most of the new population growth will come from developing countries some of these
             markets will continue to suffer severe problems with poverty and disease while others like brazil russia india
             and china face the different but equally complex task of managing sustainable economic development
             and the demands of a newlywealthy middle class

             everyone in the world will have to deal with immense change but there is one thing we know for sure we
             will all have to live and work more efficiently and find a way to prosper while using fewer resources and
             emitting less carbon

             we at ahlstrom want to play our own part by making our own operations more sustainable while continuing
             to provide the products that people need in everyday life we already have a significant presence in the
             major emerging markets and our strong culture and shared values will help us become not only a more
             global business but a more successful one

             this is our ambition as a company but it will only be achieved by the actions of individuals through the
             decisions we all make every day they may have a small impact in themselves but add them all together
             and we know we can make a real and positive difference
