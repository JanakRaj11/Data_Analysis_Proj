           given the diversity of customers and regions where we operate
           we have established the policy of aiding those for which we
           consider our support is needed most



             in view of the huge deficiencies and needs we find in some sectors of the
           population we have chosen formulas that enable us to have the widest coverage by
           creating synergies with other organizations companies customers collaborators
           commercial partners and the community itself
             we offer support to established institutions to help them achieve their objectives
           by working with them their area of specialization is optimized to address the specific
           needs of the community
             we collaborate mainly with institutions located in the cities where the company
           has operations and which address the basic needs of those less fortunate people
           preference is given to those institutions that have programs to help senior citizens
           or orphans as well as programs in support of nutrition education health and the
           prevention and attention in cases of natural disasters and emergencies
             the participation of our customers and collaborators has been a key factor for the
           success of many of the programs we have undertaken
