approach to working with cambodias impoverished rural
communities this approach has fuelled the organizations
rapid growth and contributed to the success of many
projects                                                                    phnom penh 


crdt addresses poverty by focusing on the following six
processes

living  working in the field
we are unique in that our staff resides in target villages for extended periods of time in order to ensure
activities are successful and to build relationships with communities

learning by doing
to ensure effective transfer of knowledge all beneficiaries implement project activities themselves a ripple
effect ensures experience spreads through each village

linking development  conservation
poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability are our two intertwined goals working in high priority
areas for conservation we support alternative livelihoods to reduce natural resource dependency

learning  good practice
crdt is always adapting and learning methods of implementation facilitation and participation are
continually refined as well as being revised to suit differing environments

sustainable enterprise
we are forward looking taking an enterprisewide approach to community development using concepts of
stewardship and sustainable income we plan for the long term

governance and professional practice
the ngo certificate of governance and professional practice gpp
administered by the cooperation committee for cambodia ccc is a
collective response by ngos working in partnership with donorsfunding
agencies and other stakeholders to professionalize and strengthen the ngo
sector in cambodia by encouraging and promoting their accountability
since receiving this award in 2011 crdt has maintained a high standard
monitored by followup visits from the ccc gpp team
                                                                                                                          3

    from the executive director or channy

    2013 has been the critical year for crdt where it
    reached a crossroads and it has also been the most
    challenging so far for me as executive director with
    support from the board of directors i decided on
    changes in management and program structure
    the reform plan has been introduced and put in
    place for implementation over a 2year period the
    management reforms have introduced changes in top
    management increasing the number of management
    committee members and bringing in new skills and
    competencies better decision making and changes
    to management style the program restructure was
    made in order to clearly identify priorities define the
    scope of activities improve strategies and develop
    models of implementation we are now organised
    into three main programs livelihoods microfinance
    self help groups and social businesses


    key achievements of the year include

    livelihoods the implementation strategy has been updated to be more effective and reflect
    real practice this year we were able to support 85 cbos with 1854 members including the
    establishment of nine new cbos this makes the total number of cbos up to 190 with more
    than 6700 members since the strategy was originally launched

    microfinance self help groups shgs phase i has been remarkably successful and completed in
    june 2013 by the end of the year 133 shgs had been established and basic group management
    and skills training had been provided to shgs members phase ii began in july confident of
    even greater success by the end of the year the project team had received the complete set of
    training in the shg model and credit operation systems thanks are due to our partner hand in
    hand india hih for providing the support to bring about this success

    social businesses crdtours and the tourism training center le tonlé le tonlé which has
    been taken over from swiss organization tourism for help has been operating well with a
    clear model and better business structure le tonlé has extended its operation to kratie and
    experienced further growth crdtours has become selfsufficient and able to make profits to
    support the rest of crdt

    the challenges appeared critical though fund security became the main concern throughout
    the year and a heavy workload has arisen due to budget constraints that forced us to work with
    a limited number of staff this threatens our ability to progress

    however the first year reforms reached their goals successfully the most remarkable
    achievements of the year appeared from the implementation of shgs microcredit models
    and the growth of crdts social businesses both crdtours and le tonlé the strengthened
    partnerships with hand in hand and tourism for help are also significant

    tackling the challenges throughout the year has been rewarding to me and to crdt too coming
    through such a difficult situation provides us with a promising future we have become more
    resilient we have better plans and effective strategies to cope with such critical challenges and
    to push for future growth i thank my colleagues on the management committee and all the staff
    of crdt who have maintained their commitment and continued to work hard for crdt during

4

this difficult time i am grateful to the board of directors who play active roles and support the
management of crdt i thank especially our chairman mao savin who is my indispensable
partner for his intellectual support and diligence in driving for changes i thank our donors
partners and friends who provide continued support to crdt

crdt is working towards self sustainability the goal we are seeking is to sustain both
organizational operations and beneficiaries incomes in this regard we will strive to promote
social enterprises both to create revenues to support our operations and to improve local social
economics through creating jobs crdt will also try to diversify its funding sources through
generating its own revenues and approach its extended network such as the private sector to
fundraise rather than just reliance on traditional donors

it is my privilege to work with crdt i am committed to fully completing the reform plan and
seeing a significant growth of crdt in 2014 and look forward to cherishing the continuous
success of crdt in the years to come


from the chair of the board of directors mao savin

                                        much of the boards attention in 2013 has been focused
                                        on restructuring the executive management team
                                        crdt started as a group of friends the way we have
                                        managed the organisation has been informal in nature
                                        with many decisions being taken collectively by the
                                        cofounders in the boards view the organisation had
                                        reached a size and sophistication where sadly these
                                        practices were hampering its further development
                                        therefore crdt has begun to professionalise its
                                        management because we believe that this institutional
                                        building is critical to the success of the organisation
                                        going forwards the most painful part of this process
                                        has been the changes we have made in the executive
                                        management team but that has been managed well 
                                        my congratulations to or channy the new executive
                                        director and the other management team members
                                        and staff for supporting and managing the changes
                                        internal matters aside i would like to draw your attention

to the future direction of crdt  sustainable solutions to alleviating poverty through incubating
social business enterprises crdt has long been inching in this direction but we now have it
as a clear focus you can read elsewhere in this report about the success of conversations with
foreigners crd tours le tonlé mekong credit association and the many communitybased
enterprises we have supported through our community based organisations and self help
groups the key direction for the future is to make these existing social enterprises viable as
selfsustaining businesses and to start and grow new ones

finally i am stepping down now as chair of the board after 5 years as one of the cofounders
i am very pleased with how crdt has evolved over the years and very proud of our team it
is time now for me to let a new leader take over at the top of crdt i would like to express
my sincere thanks to my fellow board members and founder advisors management and staff
for their enthusiastic support of crdt crdt is an amazing achievement coming from the
collective ideas and actions of a group of students i will be staying around and i am sure i will
remain involved in some capacity


                                                                                                      5

    livelihood development


    in 2013 nine new communitybased organisations cbos
    were established and crdt supported in total 85 cbos with
    1854 members 1163 women out of the 190 cbos that crdt
    has helped to found fewer cbos received support this year
    as several projects ended but some cbos have been able to
    run without the support of crdt as they have reached the
    last stage of their implementation strategies
    almost all of the committees and members of cbos have
    been highly committed to investing their time in the cbos
    activities but the capacity of cbos committees for group
    operation participation of members in group and commune
    meetings and understanding of process and objectives of
    commune investment plan were still limited and thus need
    further improvement to strengthen the sustainability of their
    projects
    this year beneficiaries were observed not only to have a
    better food security and variety but also to have improved
    their nutrition and health more significantly as food sources
    have been diversified the beneficiaries have spent less time
    fishing 25 and exploiting forest resources 69 to make
    their living
    members of cbos have shown a high degree of commitment
    to continuing their existing alternative livelihood activities
    of rice chicken and pig production the increased food and
    livelihood security from nonnatural resource dependent
    sources is also remarkable 90 of beneficiaries reported
    home consumption of alternative livelihood produce

by fostering networks and providing access to markets crdt is supporting local communities
to generate income to raise their standards of living farmers are able to identify value chains
and become part of a cooperative that enables them to get better prices for their products
for instance in stung treng province the
income from rice sales of the 27 cbos in
ramsar site increased from 56527 to
                                              in kratie 90 of the beneficiaries
57414 a year another aspect of income
improvement is the capacity to save and
                                              increased their rice production
budget in mondulkiri 11 saving groups
consisting of 167 members 102 women
have saved 9267 which generated
1876 in interest
in 2013 thanks to a funding from the
kusanone program from the embassy
of japan a water supply system was built
in koh phdao village kratie province
for communities to have access to clean
water for daily consumption improving
agricultural activities such as home
gardening rice intensification fish and
livestock raising as well as enhancing the
services of ecotourism in koh phdao
so far 91 households have benefited from
the system this project is contributing to
the conservation of the mekong river as
the villagers have reduced time washing
clothes and cleaning themselves in the
river a community canal of 1600m and
water storage were built in samphin
village kampong cham commune kratie
province to help beneficiaries irrigate
their rice fields




60 reported a positive impact on
health hunger or food availability
we believe demonstrating how livelihoods are so crucially linked to
sustainability will enable communities to value their environment reduce
exploitation and manage their natural resources responsibly at a time
of climatic uncertainty overall the natural resource exploitation from
communities has been reduced by 35 as the illegal fishing wildlife trade
and timber trade activities decreased

                                                                                                   7

                                           in 2013 crdtours organized several tourist group tours through
                                           various villages around the mekong river to enjoy the culture and

reinvested in the business               industry in 2013 crdtours itself made a profit of 7665 which
                                           was reinvested in the business

     the community head of koh phdao stated that this year 506 tourists visited the village and some even
     stayed for a long time however koh preah did not host a lot of tourists so crdtours considers this
     to be one of next years challenges koh preah only hosted 44 tourists providing 2358 income to the
     community

     mr men vichka bought a new motorbike by combining his savings and his salary as a community
     based ecotourism committee member of koh phdao this motodop is important for me i will use it
     for carrying tourists around my village i will take my children to school when they are older and i will
     drive my wife to the rice field

                   in rural cambodia based on a model
                   of volunteering and cultural exchange

                                                    in 2013 cwf began to roll out its new curriculum designed
                                                    to empower khmer students this approach differs to the
                                                    traditional method of teaching in developing countries which
                                                    usually uses an american based curriculum by teaching our
                                                    students to be proud of their background and to talk about
                                                    their lives they can share information on cambodia with other
                                                    nationalities focusing on conversational english we aim
                                                    to build the confidence of our khmer students in a fun and
                                                    informal setting our courses now also teach the students
                                                    about the work of crdt

                                                    the money that cwf provides to crdt acts as an unrestricted
                                                    fund the model of partnership was originally conceived to
     3000 local students per year              address the problem of unpredictability in funding from
                                                    donors and to cover costs that donors are unwilling to fund
     and has raised 114309 for crdt             so far the money from cwf has mostly been used to meet the
                                                    running costs of crdt including staff insurance salaries and
