logistics africa pursues
fuel and emissions savings by
seeking out logistics efficiencies
through the intelligent
convergence of people
processes and technology
among other initiatives the combination of route
optimisation software teams to implement and operate
technology and a wellsubstantiated business case to
sustain the use and momentum of the solution has
proved highly successful

in the context of a 15 increase in revenue growth
in 2015 and a 2 increase in kilometres travelled the
division was able to reduce usage of road fuel primarily
diesel by 3 this translated to a 6 reduction
in scope 1 emissions


the fitment of solar panels to
trailers shown in the picture
alongside is an innovative
approach to achieving energy
savings which is currently being
piloted by the division the
solar panels power internal load
body led lights refrigeration units
and the tail lift via independent
batteries if successful this
technology will bring a number of
benefits including reductions in
fuel consumption co2 emissions
and noise levels and a longer
lifecycle for component parts

               logistics international took measures during the
               year to enhance fuel and emissions efficiency including
                working with barge masters to achieve efficiencies in bunker oil consumption
                optimising the shipping fleet to combine push boats and motor vessel barges  resulting in further
                 fuel efficiencies
                continuing its programme of investment in euro 6 trucks  33 of its fleet now meets euro 6
                 standards
               the division benefits from a lower emissions profile than the logistics africa division as it
               has a far smaller dependence on roadbased transportation it accounts for approximately
               30 of the groups fuel usage and scope 1 emissions
               the division is implementing an energy management system in line with iso 50001
               standards this process involves recording analysing and evaluating all energy flows in the
               company giving transparency into energy consumption to enable opportunities for further
               energy savings to be identified

                   a significant amount of water is used to wash cars
                   each day so water recycling and rainwater capture
                   have been introduced to achieve sustained water
                   savings over time
                   currently the systems we use for measuring water usage across our many
                   facilities are being monitored for accuracy we target putting in place more robust
                   systems for measuring water consumption in future including the metering
                   of municipal water as a priority

                   several dealerships have introduced wash bays which recycle and retreat
                   water  see the schematic diagram alongside as an example at the namibian
                   dealerships the system integrates rainwater harvesting and the reuse of used
                   water and is operated using solar energy when water has been used in the
                   wash bay it flows into an underground tank containing nonhazardous chemicals
                   which purify used water and pump it back to tanks for future use approximately
                   15 000 litres of water per month are being saved as a result of the systems use

                   many dealerships have also introduced waterless car washing systems which
                   enable dealers to wash cars using only one litre of water in comparison
                   to traditional car washing methods which use up to 200 litres per car

our social impact and legitimacy
among all stakeholders at
all operations globally by
continuing to respond
to stakeholder issues

a formal economic impact and
stakeholder study is underway
to form a clearer picture of the impact
that imperial has on our direct and
indirect stakeholders
we anticipate that this analysis
will not only inform the social and
environmental initiatives we undertake
in future and support improved
reporting and communication to all
stakeholders but will also over time
help to embed longterm integrated
thinking and decisionmaking
that serves shared value creation
