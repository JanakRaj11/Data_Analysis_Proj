introduction by the president
de nederlandsche bank dnb has served the public interest from its inception on 25 march           11
1814 the form this has taken has of course changed over the 200 years that have passed since
on 1 january 2014 the promotion of financial stability was for instance explicitly enshrined in
the banking act as a dnb task as a servant of the public interest dnb has a responsibility to
society which is also reflected in its mission dnb seeks to safeguard financial stability and
thus contributes to sustainable prosperity in the netherlands corporate social responsibility is
ingrained in every aspect of our work at dnb transparency is an important component of our
corporate philosophy dnb has embraced the task of explaining to society how it operates and
why also based on the awareness that transparency enhances the effectiveness of its policies


corporate social responsibility is a way of life for dnb we focus on the long term on
sustainability in other words the financial crisis has for instance made clear that economic
growth based on excessive lending is not sustainable this lesson has been incorporated
in the evaluation of a more robust financial system and a more resilient economy on the
one hand and a possible temporary slowdown in lending and economic growth on the
other the debt crisis has revealed that the existing institutional design of the economic and
monetary union emu did not suffice to ensure financial stability with this knowledge
in mind supervision of banks has been transferred to the ecb assigning dnb with shared
responsibility for banking supervision in the entire euro area the banking union more
specifically the single supervisory mechanism ssm launched on 4 november 2014 has
induced a new wave of internationalisation for dnb in the past year a large number of
dnb staff have started working on european banking supervision either in amsterdam or in
frankfurt this development is set to continue now that the second pillar of the banking union
the european single resolution mechanism srm has also come into force


global economy on a path of gradual and uneven recovery 
the world economy is characterised by falling commodity prices including those of oil
low trade growth and the perspective of diverging monetary policies on balance economic
growth is projected to recover modestly amid low inflation which reflects negative commodity
price inflation and underutilisation of production capacity particularly in the developed
countries the imf projects the volume of global gross domestic product gdp to end up
35 higher than in 2014 the comparable growth figure in 2014 was 33 recovery remains
fragile with large growth discrepancies between countries economic growth is accelerating
in the united states but only recovering very modestly in the euro area and japan although
the emerging market economies are projected to profit from the recovery in the developed
countries in 2015 recovery in the emerging countries is also characterised by divergence
on the whole asian countries are showing better performance


the united states started repairing the damage caused by the 2008 financial crisis relatively
quickly which is why the recovery of us household balance sheets and those of businesses
and banks has progressed further than elsewhere in the world this enabled the recovery of
the transmission of the very accommodating monetary policy to the real economy the united

12   states have also profited from having a relatively flexible economy which enabled quicker
     absorption of the consequences of the financial crisis unemployment had for instance fallen to
     56 in december 2014 from almost 10 in 2010 economic recovery has also profited from the
     impact of shale gas and oil extraction which has taken great flight in the united states shale
     gas provides us consumers and manufacturers with the certainty of controlled energy prices
     for longer periods of time


     shale gas extraction also has a significant influence on the global oil market by way of falling
     imports of oil into the united states the global oil market saw a remarkable development
     these past few months with crude oil brent prices per barrel halving within six months
     the price fall is mainly attributable to an ongoing large supply of oil and in part to decelerating
     demand for oil which is also being dampened by less buoyant growth in emerging market
     economies the chinese economy is for instance experiencing a gradual slowdown to a
     more sustainable growth rate the local authorities are combining policies aimed at reducing
     financial vulnerabilities with complementary growth enhancing policies as a result the imf
     projects economic growth in china to slow down from 734 in 2013 to around 634 in 2015
     the slowdown will have a spillover effect to the rest of the asian region


     the drop in oil prices has diverging economic effects for oil importing countries these
     effects are positive on balance owing to increasing purchasing power and private demand
     cheaper energy also benefits the investment climate but for most oil exporting countries this
     has unfavourable ramifications it depresses their flow of income which negatively affects
     their current accounts and public finances oil exporting countries with largescale dollar
     denominated liabilities are impacted even more severely as the us dollar appreciated sharply
     in the past few months in the longer term the global economy will not profit by sustained low
     oil prices however as these for instance dampen import demand of oilexporting countries
     the russian economy is suffering heavily from the repercussions of low oil prices in addition
     to having to deal with the effect of the economic sanctions imposed in response to the
     situation in ukraine this will also have a negative effect on russian demand for products from
     neighbouring countries from the perspective of sustainable economic growth structurally
     low oil prices are unfavourable as they make the necessary investments in sustainable energy
     sources less profitable in the longer term


      with significant downward risks
     the risks associated with this fragile and divergent recovery are largely downwards first
     and foremost there are geopolitical risks the situation in the middle east together with the
     tensions between russia and ukraine may have a detrimental effect on global economic
     growth a drop in world trade growth is an obvious transmission channel but recovery may
     also be hit by unexpected and excessive movements in the financial and commodities markets
     and by a dent in the gradually growing confidence of households and businesses

annual report




geopolitical risks in the form of attacks on the financial infrastructure may also hamper          13
recovery cyberattacks are for instance launched by public organisations such as security
agencies with the purpose of acquiring sensitive information such cyberattacks have a
large potential impact due to the vital role that information systems play in the financial
sector cyber resilience deserves and is getting attention from the highest executive levels at
financial institutions and infrastructures intensifying attention however remains important
international authorities are considering how measures enhancing security and safeguarding
business continuity may help persevering with high standards


financial markets have become increasingly sensitive to changes in monetary policy
particularly in the united states there is a great dependence on central bank liquidity as a
source of price gains in financial markets central banks in turn are becoming more and more
dependent on the financial markets for the transmission of their policies particularly for the
unconventional variants this has led to sustained very accommodating financial conditions
which underpin recovery by means of low lending rates and better access to funds but they
also have other consequences investors are looking for returns without the associated risks
being adequately reflected in pricing this makes for potentially large effects of a turnaround in
risk sentiment the probability of such a turnaround is increasing in tandem with the economic
recovery in the united states as economic recovery in the united states is progressing at
greater speed than elsewhere normalisation of monetary policy there is also approaching
faster than in other regions if the federal reserve postpones normalisation of monetary
policy asset price inflation on the financial markets may be fuelled further this carries risks
for financial stability as the reduction of excessive debt levels in various regions is under way
but has not yet been completed normalisation will also have consequences for the financial
markets not only in the united states but also in other countries the us dollar and the swiss
franc have for instance appreciated as a result of expectations about regional differences in
monetary policy positions international spillover effects of normalisation may particularly
hit emerging market economies with less robust macroeconomic foundations clear
communications by the fed and other central banks on monetary policy intentions may ensure
that financial markets are not taken by surprise policy makers in emerging countries could
contribute to stability by solidifying their macroeconomic foundations and policy frameworks
 for instance in the macroprudential area


the glass is half full in the euro area 
the deceleration of world trade growth is also being felt in the euro area via lower than
anticipated economic recovery this is why the drop in oil prices is a welcome growth impetus
for the euro area comparable with the effects of shale gas extraction in the united states
the impulse is being strengthened by the depreciation of the euro which will support exports
the euro depreciated in particular against the us dollar the chinese yuan and recently the
swiss franc measured by the importance of countries for euro area trade the euro has lost
around 11 of its value since april 2014 all in all the imf expects economic growth in the euro
area to accelerate modestly from 08 in 2014 to 12 in 2015 and 14 in 2016

14   the lower euro exchange rate is also dampening the downward influence of oil prices on
     inflation nevertheless the level of oil prices will lead to negative inflation rates in 2015
     negative inflation is not the same thing as deflation however deflation is a much more
     harmful situation of selfreinforcing price slides embedding themselves into expectations
     and wage formation there is no question of this at present but prolonged low inflation does
     carry risks relative price adjustments for instance progress at a slower pace due to which
     the competitive positions of current account deficit countries will only improve very slowly
     in addition to this longterm inflation expectations may deanchor if inflation remains below
     target for a prolonged period of time this may affect the credibility of monetary policy
     low nominal growth which is often accompanied by low inflation is also an impediment to
     debt reduction


      and institutions have been reinforced
     major progress was made in 2014 in the reinforcement of the institutional framework of the
     euro area on 4 november 2014 the first component of the banking union the ssm was
     launched the successful completion of a comprehensive balance sheet review at the largest
     banks in the euro area known as the comprehensive assessment was a first milestone for
     the ssm this assessment consisting of an asset quality review aqr and stress testing
     provided for a clear understanding of the financial health of the largest and internationally
     most interconnected banks in the euro area the majority of these banks including all seven
     dutch banks partaking in the assessment are capitalised adequately their capital positions
     will also remain adequate in a hypothetical case of a scenario of economic headwinds not only
     are the principal european and dutch banks sufficiently strong they are also able to weather
     the storm the publication of these results has contributed to the transparency on the financial
     sector that society demands from the supervisory authorities this benefits confidence in the
     new european supervisor and in the european financial sector considering the latter we may
     draw a comparison with the confidence boost provided by the publication of the results of the
     review of the us banking sector in 2009


     on 1 january 2015 the second pillar of the banking union the srm was launched the two
     pillars of supervision and resolution at european level will break the negative interaction
     between governments and banks which was one of the main causes of the european debt
     crisis in 2010 the srm is a european framework for a concerted approach to banks that are
     no longer viable the objective is to achieve orderly resolution of systemically relevant banks
     should difficulties arise without endangering financial stability and without material risk
     to the state or the taxpayer the srm includes a resolution authority known as the single
     resolution board srb in 2015 the srb will focus mainly on operationalising its duties
     and responsibilities the last include resolution planning and taking measures to improve
     the resolvability of significant and crossborder institutions in europe for a failing bank
     to be resolved in an orderly manner it is of fundamental importance that it has sufficient
     loss absorption capacity banks must therefore manage their balance sheets to ensure that
     such capacity is available in the event of resolution this may be achieved by issuing special

annual report




purpose debt paper which in the case of default of the bank can be used to absorb losses            15
and be converted into new capital instruments this enables recapitalisation of the essential
components of the institution the costs of possible failure will thus be primarily transferred
to shareholders and creditors of the bank bailin from 2016 onwards the srb will have the
power to decide on the actual resolution of a failing institution and to use the instruments at
its disposal the srb will also have a european resolution fund srf at its disposal which will
in due course be financed by contributions from the banking sector that said for the credibility
of the srm it is crucially important that this fund is financed adequately and has sufficient and
credible backup the srb board consists of its executive members and representatives of the
national resolution authorities the cabinet has designated dnb as the national resolution
authority for banks in the netherlands we will return to this topic below


the banking union is founded on adequate prudential rules and regulations deriving from
the stricter liquidity and capital requirements being imposed globally as part of the basel iii
regulations some countries are imposing even stricter regulations in view of the large degree
of concentration in our banking sector the dutch government aims to achieve a relatively
higher leverage ratio for systemically important banks in the netherlands currently firm
implementation of the agreed measures takes precedence over a further refining of the
prudential rules one exception must be made being the current preferential treatment
of government debt in supervisory rules this treatment does not reflect the risks that
investments in such debt instruments are exposed to this particularly applies to debt issued
by countries that have national fiscal sovereignty but in fact do not have national monetary
sovereignty addressing this weakness in rules and regulations will enhance confidence in the
banking industry and interbank lending


shadow banking demands increased attention from policy makers a wellregulated banking
sector may give cause for a shift of risks to the largely unregulated shadow banking system
this is a collection of institutions including money market funds financing and investment
companies that together provide credit intermediary services thereby replicating the regular
banking industry new instruments and regulations must be developed in order to prevent
these activities from becoming new sources of systemic risk


and finally on 1 august 2014 the single euro payments area sepa came into effect on that
date the harmonisation of the main noncash payment methods in europe was completed
laying the foundations for more efficient european money transfer which should be achieved
in the years ahead by means of increased scale and more competition the creation of a single
market for euro payments may serve as an important lubricant for free transfer of labour and
capital one of the cornerstones of the single market


limits of monetary policy are approaching 
in view of the declining inflation expectations and the slow economic recovery in 2014
monetary reins in the euro area were loosened further the policy rate was lowered in stages

16   to five basis points and the deposit rate has turned negative the further reduction of the policy
     rate is gradually translating into lower borrowing rates by means of targeted communications
     in the form of forward guidance the ecb has indicated that the policy rate is set to remain low
     for some considerable time in addition to the lowering of policy rates new unconventional
     monetary measures were taken the focus has been shifted from supporting the financing
     options for banks towards more structured influencing of lending operations and the status
     of monetary policy the first is effectuated by means of targeted longerterm refinancing
     operations  tltros the second via purchasing programmes for government bonds bonds
     issued by european institutions covered bonds issued by banks and assetbacked securities
     between march 2015 and at least september 2016 an amount of eur 60 billion of these assets
     will be purchased each month this will create more than eur 1100 billion of new liquidity
     if these programmes have the effect of lowering borrowing rates and depressing the euro
     exchange rate spending and consequently inflation may be positively affected it is as yet
     too early to make any pronouncements on the effectiveness of the policy measures taken
     the starting position of the euro area differs from that of the united states when similar policy
     measures were introduced there at the end of 2008 the difference not only concerns interest
     rate levels which were a great deal higher at the time there are also significant differences
     between the financial system in the united states and that in the euro area for instance
     with respect to the importance of bank and market funding which makes for a different
     transmission of such policies to the real economy at the same time largescale liquidity
     injections are not without risk for instance to dnbs balance sheet and they also contribute
     to a further rise in asset prices on the financial markets the easy liquidity conditions have
     prompted the illusion of permanent liquidity and are reflected in increased risk appetite on the
     financial markets this in turn results in a growing appetite for taking financial risks that is not
     accompanied by a willingness to take on economic risks if financial risks are taken that are not
     supported by real economic expectations this will only result in investment portfolio reshuffles
     ie of existing assets an appetite for economic risk is for instance reflected in investments in
     new assets eg a new plant such investments are a source of economic growth


     in the past years several countries have used macroprudential instruments in order to mitigate
     the unwanted sideeffects of the accommodating monetary policy these are primarily
     countries where house prices have risen sharply such as switzerland belgium and the united
     kingdom these countries have taken various measures to curb excessive mortgage lending
     other countries like norway and sweden have activated the countercyclical capital buffer
     in order to control the risks associated with credit growth in order to boost the financial
     sectors resilience still other mainly smaller countries have imposed additional capital buffer
     requirements on systemically relevant institutions although they are effective in boosting
     resilience it is debatable whether the use of macroprudential instruments only will suffice to
     mitigate adequately the risks of prolonged accommodating monetary policy


     now that the ecb has used virtually all monetary policy instruments at its disposal
     implementing reforms has become even more important such reforms aimed at increasing

annual report




real economic convergence improve economic cohesion and integration of the different parts             17
of the euro area in this way joint monetary policy can be finetuned even more thereby
reducing the likelihood of asymmetric shocks in the event of such shocks occurring greater
economic flexibility will ensure that the process of adjustment is started up relatively quickly
this is where the united states clearly outperforms the euro area a catchup effort in europe
requires a compatible economic structure and institutions in member states that are all aimed
at promoting economic growth enhancing real convergence is inseparably bound up with
increased risk sharing with the former being a precondition for the latter that said for the
support base of the emu it is essential that increased risk sharing is democratically endorsed
this requires political decisions


 making effective supporting policies even more important
in order to achieve sustained higher economic growth and price stability in the euro area a
combination of accommodating monetary policy and effective measures in other policy areas is
required as far as budgetary policy is concerned the available scope within the new budgetary
rules should be used to the full on the whole budgetary deficits are projected to be within the
reference value of 3 of gdp in 2015 but many countries still have alarmingly high debt levels
another sideeffect of the purchasing programmes referred to is that the discipline exercised
by the markets on government finances will decline this means that budgetary rules have
become even more important to safeguard discipline in government budgeting consequently
a budgetary impetus must be provided by specific countries or by the composition of
government budgets countries may for instance optimise the influence of government policy
on growth by shifting costs from labour to wealth or consumption in the composition of
expenditure increasing public investment is worth considering especially in countries where
the quality of the infrastructure is below par the demand on public finances can be reduced
by financing public investments partially through publicprivate effort or at european level
the recent plan presented by european commission president juncker may therefore have
a positive effect although this will to a large extent depend on how the plan will be put into
effect


the impact of monetary and budgetary measures may be further enhanced by actions taken on
the supply side of the economy as said extensive measures have already been implemented
in the financial sector these are also aimed at boosting the financial sectors allocation
function as savings find their way better to the more productive sectors growth potential is
enhanced such reinforcements also benefit by further deepening and broadening of market
financing the internal capital market eg for securitisation of venture capital is less efficient
and accessible in the eu than in the united states this is also attributable to institutional
constraints within the union such as differences in company law and bankruptcy laws
reducing these constraints will therefore create scope for broadening the financing base for
european businesses with lower capital costs and increased investments as a result

18   in other areas too there is still ample scope for more extensive structural reforms in the
     peripheral euro area impressive and socially uncomfortable internal wage and price
     adjustments have been made the deployment of policies in these countries should now
     be focussed increasingly on changing the economic structure too long and too often
     institutions and commodities and labour market regulations have hampered innovation
     and entrepreneurship in several countries this is still the case meaning that sectors where
     relatively low added value is created are overly represented in our globalised world this leads
     to wage and price competition from emerging economies especially asian ones historical
     experience in other countries including the netherlands has taught us that this battle cannot
     be won in view of the differing stages of economic development although especially countries
     benefiting from support programmes have made progress since 2011 eg in the efficiency of
     product and labour markets a great deal of ground still needs to be covered in this respect
     regrettably the pace of reform has been falling off these past few years while large countries
     such as france and italy are even starting to lag behind european governments should devote
     more attention to the ease with which businesses may be started up and young businesses
     may be allowed to grow to a bigger scale important measures here are further curbing of
     employment protection in fixed employment contracts spain france a more activating
     labour market policy ireland or liberalising of network sectors portugal and regulated
     occupations such as lawyers france italy the quality of government and the legal system
     also warrants improvement italy the power that these and other structural reforms have of
     boosting economic growth through higher productivity should not be underestimated oecd
     calculations show that relative to other developed countries the euro area benefits more
     significantly from structural reforms more than the united states for instance in the euro area
     the stimulating effects of reforms may increase to 6 of gdp on average


     budding recovery in the netherlands
     since the financial crisis economic growth in the netherlands has lagged behind that in
     the surrounding countries the financial crisis has revealed that the previous growth rates
     based on excessive debt accumulation are unsustainable as purse strings needed to be
     tightened domestic spending and consequently economic growth came under pressure
     the dutch economy was kept upright by foreign trade of dutch goods and services for a
     prolonged period of time the induced balance sheet repair  not only for households but
     also for the government and the financial sector  has provided the foundation for more
     sustainable growth since mid2013 the economic sentiment in the netherlands has been
     picking up markedly confidence in the housing market also increased in 2014 evidenced by
     the rising number of transactions and modestly higher prices although there continue to be
     large regional differences it looks as though the housing market will continue on the path
     of recovery in 2015 partly owing to government measures aimed at preventing a repetition
     of past excesses price rises should remain under control with the return of consumer and
     producer confidence domestic spending is expected to show a more favourable trend which
     is good news for small and mediumsized enterprises smes this sector was hit hard by the
     crisis and has to date only profited modestly from the largely exportled recovery with the

annual report




growing scope for domestic spending industrial sectors such as construction hospitality and     19
business services will also gain momentum the growing domestic and foreign trade of goods
and services produced in the netherlands will provide the dutch economy with two sources
of growth again although economic growth is set to accelerate between 2014 and 2016 the
pace of growth will be modest from a historical perspective the recovery will however have
a beneficial influence on the labour market employment growth picked up speed in 2014 and
the number of vacancies continues to rise


beware of defeatism but also of complacency
there is no reason for pessimism prosperity in the netherlands ranks among the highest in
the world measured by gdp per head of the population a large number of dutch people
participate in the labour market and productivity per hour is relatively high the dutch
economy is in a favourable structural position partly owing to government measures
legislation in the fields of aow state pensions private pensions and the housing market is
underpinning the dynamics resilience and stability of the dutch economy this partly applies
to the labour market measures taken including the simplification of the right of dismissal
normalisation of flex work and rationalisation of the unemployment benefits system
considerable progress has also been made in putting government finances in order


this gives policy makers no reason for complacency however although government finances
have returned to a sustainable path budgetary margins remain tight thanks to the priority
that the cabinet has given to budgetary soundness the netherlands was able to leave the
excessive deficit procedure but public finances are not yet completely in order further
reduction of government debt is desirable not only due to the ageing population the low
level of government debt in the years directly preceding the crisis has proven its usefulness
for our country during the crisis it provided the government with a financial buffer to absorb
the first blows restoring these buffers will benefit the sustainability of future economic
growth how and when to restore buffers is a political decision of course which will also take
into account the ensuing effects on economic growth this does not by definition involve a
contradiction the government not only takes decisions with respect to the size of its income
and expenditure but also to the composition thereof where the latter is concerned the review
of the tax system features deservedly high on the cabinets priority list


if the current tight budgetary margins widen the use of the extra margin for the benefit of tax
review will contribute to both tax solidity and growth relief of taxes on labour income may
make it worth peoples while to start working or to increase their working hours in addition
not all groups respond to tax incentives in the same way meaning that targeted policies may
amplify employment gains in order to compensate for lower taxation on labour an increase in
income from vat may be considered broadening the vat base can be effectuated by reducing
the number of products with low vat rates andor raising the low vat rate there is also
scope for broadening of the income tax base tax subsidies on pension saving may be reduced
by having tax deductibility of pension contributions fall as income grows the same applies to

20   the  gradual and longterm  tax neutral treatment of the home in box 3 income tax income
     from savings and investments the latter is in conformity with the recommendations for
     system review made by the van dijkhuizen commission


     the economic structure in the netherlands post crisis 
     when the dust has settled on the financial crisis the new economic reality will be different
     than that immediately preceding the crisis the structure of the dutch economy is changing as
     a result of technological developments and societal trends research shows that technological
     adjustments are spreading around the world increasingly swiftly whereas it took 120 years for
     steam ships to make their entry in most countries the internet took only seven this means
     that specialisations and sectors also shift faster the dutch economy specialises increasingly
     in highgrade services although the commercial services sector itself accounts for relatively
     limited exports it does contribute substantially to exports of other sectors measured in terms
     of added value the services sector has taken over the growth baton from the industrial sector
     such changes also affect corporate investments in recent years expenditure on research and
     development software and databases has become increasingly important for businesses as
     compared to investments in tangible assets the labour market is also changing employment
     contracts are becoming more and more flexible and older workers are starting to play an
     increasingly important role both as a result of the ageing population and the lower number of
     young people entering the labour market


     the adaptability of the dutch economy must grow in tandem with the rapidly changing
     world economy innovation is instrumental in this process and there is mostly no lack of it in
     the netherlands between 2008 and 2012 the number of companies engaging in innovative
     activities grew relatively quickly compared with other eu countries companies operating in
     the netherlands relatively often engage in product and process innovation


     owing to innovations the netherlands now has a costefficient and quick payment system
     which also illustrates the ongoing necessity of investments in innovations without profitability
     being certain from the start contactless payment in shops for instance made a promising start
     last year on the other hand the electronic purse discontinued in january 2015 serves as an
     example of an innovation that has shown insufficient return and we are now ready to take
     the next step towards real time payments which are payments or money transfers processed
     in real time making the funds available on the receivers account within seconds of payment
     initiation such initiatives have already been taken in various countries but the netherlands will
     still have to make a significant effort in this field


     innovation is not a guarantee for success of course but failing to innovate is certain to create
     a disadvantage the government has a facilitating role here as it is difficult to project how
     our country will earn its money in the future generic measures aimed at adaptability are even
     more important promoting entrepreneurship transfer of knowledge between the corporate

important


the corporate sector also benefits from smooth access to finance in the netherlands
businesses mainly depend on bank financing a more diverse system would contribute to
sustainable growth and a better shock absorbing ability since the financial crisis market
financing has become increasingly available to businesses which is a hopeful development
to date only large companies have turned to market funding however access to this source
of finance for smes has remained limited with less than 10 of these companies using market
financing increased availability of funding would certainly be welcome for the sme sector
which provides many employment opportunities with startups being particularly important
for innovation alternative sources of finance may very well complement the current largely
bankprovided financing for smes both for loans and riskbearing capital more and more
alternative options are becoming available to smes including qredits participation funds
crowd funding and credit unions dnb welcomes these developments which facilitate lending
and in principle takes a positive view of tangible initiatives to this end such as credit unions
and crowd funding dnb uses a dedicated approach including riskbased assessment with
prudential requirements linked to corresponding risks securitisations of sme loans may
boost financing for smes securitisations and other forms of sme financing would benefit
from increased transparency with respect to the financeability of smes to this end various
initiatives were launched including standard business reporting  this project was developed
by the government and the banking sector and aims to make business information available
to investors in a standardised form  at the request of the company itself such initiatives
whereby the government joins forces with private parties to play a facilitating role are to be
preferred to additional subsidies or guarantee schemes


the government also has a role to play in securing the sustainability of public sector schemes in
a changing society our pension system is a case in point the current system is not sufficiently
tuned to the changing patterns emerging in society and the labour market employees change
jobs more often temporarily stop working or continue working in a selfemployed capacity
the group of pensioners is growing and women are accounting for a larger proportion of the
work force as a result pension entitlements are becoming more expensive larger and more
insecure this makes the system less resilient to financial shocks also because the option of
absorbing them by raising pension contributions is wearing out consequently risks are shifting
to pension scheme members at the same time the support base for the pension system is in
danger of eroding as the system is incapable of being transparent on the value of individual
entitlements prior to retirement this creates uncertainty about the consequences of social
and financial developments for individual pension scheme members the same applies to the
legitimacy of this reallocation between member groups these trends demand reforms in order
to secure the social and financial sustainability of the system for the future the state secretary
of social affairs and employment has facilitated a broadbased public debate about the future
of the pension system dnb participates actively in this debate both from the perspective of

22   the role it plays in society and in its capacity as supervisory authority a sustainable pension
     system has a number of important characteristics these include transparent ownership rights
     for scheme members and a fair distribution of risks a sustainable system does not consistently
     put specific member groups at a disadvantage in favour of other groups in addition to
     this members individual pensions and pension buildup rates also differ according to their
     risk bearing capacity which for instance differs between older and younger members and
     between higher and lower incomes dnb also believes that a sustainable pension system itself
     should not be a source of macroeconomic fluctuations and imbalances which the current
     system is for instance in the way financial shocks are absorbed and finally in view of todays
     labour market a sustainable pension system demands a review of the obligation to save for
     retirement that does justice to the different forms of employment


      and the role played by the financial sector
     the banking sector has an important social function stable and efficient banking services are
     a precondition for economic growth banks must be made futureproof to prevent society
     from having to pick up the bill for excessive risks taken by banks this is the lesson that we
     have learnt from the financial crisis and motivates the development of the recent national and
     international regulations with respect to supervision of the financial sector


     as said dnb has been the resolution authority for the netherlands since 1 january 2015 and
     is part of the single resolution mechanism of the european banking union in addition to
     this shared responsibility for significant european banks dnb is also directly responsible for
     resolution planning and execution for the nonsignificant banking institutions and a number
     of investment firms in the netherlands in its capacity as national resolution authority
     dnb together with the single resolution board will continue to operationalise the resolution
     plans prepared by the significant banks it will also give further substance to the set resolution
     instruments provided for in the relevant eu bank recovery and resolution directive in order
     to ensure that they can actually be used if the need arises putting these instruments including
     bailin into effect of course also requires the institutions to make the necessary adjustments
     a national resolution fund will be set up in 2015 which will support an institutions resolution
     where needed using the fees it charges to banks and a small number of investment firms
     for banks the national resolution fund will merge into the european resolution fund next year


     the dutch banking industry is large and concentrated both from a historical and an
     international perspective it is dominated by a small number of large domestic banks engaging
     in a broad spectrum of activities from the perspective of stability and efficiency less
     concentration and more scope for diversity would be preferable the european banking union
     will in due course provide an impetus to the stability and efficiency of banking services eg by
     improving the resolvability of banks and by stimulating crossborder competition the banking
     union may however also lead to the emergence of very large banks that will prove to be too
     complex to resolve regardless of all the measures taken in view of the importance and urgency

of this the relevant european policy makers should not waste any time discussing whether an           23
upper limit must be imposed on the size of european banks as was done in the united states


in the dutch insurance sector the life market in particular is experiencing structural changes
the pressure on earnings generating capacity will continue to grow the ban on commission
has made the market less demanddriven and consumers are asking for more transparency
and simplicity this and the reputational damage caused by investmentlinked insurance will
structurally depress sales in the individual life market although the group life market offers
growth opportunities especially in the pension field these will most probably be insufficient
to compensate for the shrinking individual life market margins are also tight due to severe
competition also from noninsurance products and institutions this demands ongoing cost
savings to which consolidation may contribute but this alone is unlikely to be sufficient to
cushion shrinking sales due to the complex back offices of individual insurance companies
it is uncertain whether merging of companies will reduce complexity and scale benefits will
be achieved this outlook requires sufficiently realistic plans from insurers and adequate cost
savings from life insurance companies to this end it is crucially important that insurance
companies have a sufficient understanding of their future cost structures cost allocation
methods and cost assumptions as a consequence of the great significance of a stable
insurance sector for the economy and society it is essential for insurers to prepare themselves
for fundamental changes in the market in the longer term and to consider different scenarios
when doing this the construction of these scenarios should go beyond the existing market
situation and the current business models


sustainable financial sector demands trust
dnb is committed to ensuring a healthy and stable financial sector as this will make the
best contribution to sustainable prosperity it requires public trust in the integrity of financial
institutions and their management boards the integrity incidents seen in the past few years
have dented the financial sectors reputation and the publics trust they have also led to
high fines legal costs and claims for damages meaning that integrity risks not only affect the
reputation but also the financial positions of institutions and confidence in the financial sector
as a whole


financial institutions are expected to help safeguard the integrity of the sector and to ensure
sound and controlled business operations first of all institutions must see to it that their
customers do not abuse them for instance to circumvent sanctions legislation finance
criminal activities or avoid paying taxes in addition institutions are required to check that
their staff members show ethical behaviour and do not misuse their information position or
their authority for their own benefit or that of others it is also essential that institutions in
their daytoday management not only abide by the letter but also by the spirit of the law
and demonstrate respect for social norms and standards in their actions the fact that certain
actions are not explicitly prohibited does not mean that they are allowed

24   financial institutions are their own best judges in identifying which organisational units and
     activities are susceptible to integrity risks it is then the institutions duty to take adequate
     measures to control these risks or if necessary put an end to the activities in question if the
     associated risks are not managed to a sufficient extent institutions are already required to
     report incidents actively to dnb


     integrity supervision is a national authority meaning that dnb can act independently
     it focuses on the management of known risks and identification of new ones the experience
     of the past years with the fraudulent activities in the real estate sector and the interest
     and currency rate manipulations has taught us that activities involving financial incentives
     in combination with generous discretionary authorities for individual staff members and
     inadequate checks and balances are very susceptible to integrity risks when identifying new
     risks and combating financial and economic criminal activities as part of the financial expertise
     centre fec dnb cooperates closely with third parties such as the authority for the financial
     markets the tax authority fiunl the fiscal information and investigation service fiod and
     the public prosecution service om dnb translates current themes into a practical approach
     aimed at risk identification and mitigation for 2015 these themes include sanctions corruption
     and financing of terrorism


     transparency is a powerful tool to increase both the effectiveness of supervision and
     confidence in the financial sector openness in supervision will force institutions into complying
     with the standards set through targeted communications dnb can guide the sector in
     the envisaged direction as said transparency about financial institutions and supervision
     thereof can also contribute to the restoration of confidence in the sector the commitment
     to achieving maximum possible transparency also fits in with the social role that dnb plays
     in response to the crisis there was an increased call for a better understanding of the financial
     sector and the way in which dnb performs its tasks inspired by its ambition to act in a socially
     responsible way dnb is always willing to account to society for its actions this endorses our
     role and also creates increased support for our actions


     a great deal may have changed over the past 200 years but dnbs commitment and that of its
     staff to ensuring a healthy financial environment has remained the same

the dutch economy contracted in three of the five years in the period
20092013 on the back of improved consumer and producer sentiment
since the summer of 2013 domestic expenditure recovered and real gross
domestic product gdp showed a modest rise of 08 in 2014 growing
confidence in the stability and sustainability of the financial system is one of
the factors behind the improved economic sentiment the growth outlooks
for the netherlands and the euro area are modest for the years ahead
which is why high unemployment levels are falling only at a very slow pace
while the process of deleveraging by the government and households is far
from complete the focus must gradually shift to raising sustainable growth
and prosperity private and public investment in economic and human capital
plays an important role in this respect to promote such investment in the
future there are various areas where reforms need to be implemented
if these reforms are successful the european economies will emerge
from the crisis stronger and more robust this chapter lays down dnbs
recommended course  including considerations  in four sections

section 12 zooms in on the need to continue the structural reform agenda in order to raise
the sustainable economic development in the netherlands this requires for example
making adjustments to the labour market and a number of collective arrangements such as
the health care and pension systems section 13 deals with the impact of the new rules and
requirements aimed at enhancing the soundness of the dutch banking sector and financial
stability with special attention being devoted to sme finance issues sections 14 and 15 take
a broader perspective by discussing the economic and monetary union emu section 14
addresses the further easing of the conventional and unconventional monetary policies in 2014
and early 2015 to stimulate inflation and economic growth in the euro area the boundaries of
what monetary policy can achieve are in sight additional budgetary and structural measures
are unavoidable and should in the end enable the phasing out of the unconventional measures
section 15 concludes the chapter and deals with the risks of the accommodative monetary
policy such as the unbalanced pricing in some financial market segments central banks
consider the negative side effects of monetary measures in their policies macroprudential
instruments can counter these side effects to a limited extent

28   12 the netherlands after the crisis focus shifting to raising
     sustainable growth

     deleveraging and falling house prices have dampened economic growth in recent years
     currently economic confidence is increasing the housing market is slowly getting back on
     its feet and domestic expenditure is once again contributing to growth the government can
     support sustainable growth by continuing its structural reform agenda


     121 sluggish recovery
     the netherlands is slowly but surely recovering from the 2008 global credit crisis and the
     second dip which followed in 2012 see chart 11 recovery from both crises is not just slow
     due to the weak external environment but also as a result of lagging domestic expenditure
     for example in 2013 real gross capital formation which is an important component of domestic
     demand was still almost 20 below the level seen shortly before the credit crisis broke out

reduced their benefits see also section 24 government debt rose from 43 of gdp in 2007
to almost 70 of gdp in 2014 initially the government absorbed the economic downturn
by letting its budget deficit rise and through automatic stabilisers such as unemployment
benefits later in 2009 and 2010 the government provided a discretionary spending boost
however the government was then forced to consolidate in order to prevent government
debt from rising further and comply with european budgetary agreements this meant that it
both reduced its expenditures including government investment and raised taxes households
in the meantime saw their disposable incomes stagnate due to the deteriorated labour market
conditions in addition balance sheet repair by the government and pension funds affected
households disposable incomes through higher taxes social insurance contributions and
pension contributions


households also saw their wealth deteriorate in particular due to housing market
developments from 1990 to the start of the credit crisis house prices rose by 150 in real
terms partly as a result of generous tax incentives relaxed financing conditions and sluggish
housing supply during this phase higher house prices went hand in hand with excessive and
unsustainable debt accumulation the crisis  and the great uncertainty that went with it 
ended house price increases and the ensuing positive wealth effects on private consumption

30   the number of transactions fell rapidly after the credit crisis struck and house prices fell
     from peak to trough by approximately 20 in nominal terms and approximately 30 in real
     terms around a quarter of home owners are confronted with mortgages in excess of their
     house value underwater mortgages due to the high loantovalue ltv ratios of their loans
     beyond compulsory pension fund savings households have also substantially increased their
     noncontractual savings in recent years in order to repair their wealth positions at the expense
     of private consumption


     gross capital formation also fell markedly in particular household investment in houses
     corporate investment in buildings and government investment in infrastructure see chart 12
     these constructionrelated investment categories make out almost half of the total investments
     the volume of other investment is currently at the same level as in 2008 in addition smes have
     faced financing problems in recent years which may have restricted investment in that sector
     see section 13


     122 modest economic upswing in 2014
     now the dutch economy seems to be slowly shrugging off the global credit crisis and domestic
     balance sheet problems the government has brought the rise of its debt to a halt and the
     netherlands exited the excessive deficit procedure in 2014 we have seen an improvement in
     producer and consumer confidence since the summer of 2013 which was even relatively strong in
     international comparison households finally saw their disposable incomes rise again in 2014 and
     for the first time in years domestic expenditure did not have a negative impact on gdp growth


     the housing market also showed signs of recovery to strengthen financial stability
     the government has taken various measures in recent years aimed at reducing the incentives
     to high debt financing of own homes this means that househunting households have received
     more clarity about the tax conditions that apply to them beyond that generous transition
     periods have been introduced to avoid sharp reductions in the borrowing capacity of households
     the number of transactions rose considerably in 2014 with house prices edging up
     many firsttime buyers have postponed their home purchases in recent years which implies
     that pentup demand will further support the number of transactions this will also partly
     improve the mobility of existing homeowners the rise in transaction numbers is expected
     to translate into an increase in the average house price despite the tightening of lending
     standards in 2015 the housing market is likely to generate some positive spending effects
     for the economy in the years ahead albeit at a considerably lower level than in the precrisis
     period the government has not yet completed its deleveraging process which is evident from
     for instance the overshooting of the 60 debt ceiling that is again expected for the next few
     years this is why sustainable growth will mainly have to come from other sources

despite the recent lean years dutch prosperity as measured by per capita gdp is still high on
an international scale dutch per capita gdp is well over the eu average and is still on a par
with its european peers see table 11 per capita gdp is significantly below that in the united
states in particular because the dutch work fewer hours in 2013 productivity per hour may
have been lower than in the united states but this is mainly because following the outbreak
of the credit crisis us employment has adjusted more quickly and strongly than that of the
netherlands shortly before the crisis dutch productivity per hour was virtually at the same
level as in the united states table 11 shows that the financial crisis has hit the dutch economy
harder than european peer economies this is mainly related to the fact that house prices in the
netherlands fell quite considerably in the period under review

participation by dutch women partly through a good parttime work environment and ample
availability of flexiblehour contracts partly as a result of that the share of active workers
is particularly high in the netherlands see table 11 further modernisation of the economic
structure remains necessary to maintain the favourable prosperity position here lie various
challenges


first of all the netherlands will have to continue investing in the adaptability of its economy
independently of crisisrelated adjustments the dutch economy is of course subject to
structural changes on a continuous basis given that it is increasingly easy for new technologies
to spread globally specialisations can shift more quickly in the rapidly changing global economy

32   stagnation means decline the dutch economy will have to adapt continuously to maintain
     its structural growth potential because it is difficult to predict how the netherlands will earn
     its money in the future it is particularly important to take generic measures aimed at the
     economys adaptability promoting entrepreneurship encouraging exchanges between the
     business sector and knowledge institutes and ensuring access to finance policies should be
     aimed at both existing and new enterprises the business sector also benefits from a well
     educated labour force with workers who are able to adapt to new technologies quickly
     the governments role is in ensuring highquality initial education adequate further training is
     also a responsibility of employers and workers


     the nature of the labour market has also changed fundamentally for example the participation
     of older workers has increased considerably partly as a result of the governments active policy
     in the light of demographic ageing one example is that various routes to early retirement
     occupational disability act unemployment act and early retirement schemes have largely been
     blocked since the nineties as a result of the growing share of older people in the population and
     their extended labour participation the role of older workers on the labour market has become
     increasingly important in the early nineties workers aged between 55 and 65 years made out
     only 6 of total workers in 2014 their share was more than 17 see chart 13

the continued fundability of collective arrangements will require a further increase in labour     33
participation in terms of numbers of both workers and hours which calls for various measures
deferred retirement is a first step with the recent increase of the pensionable age making
an important contribution it must be ensured however that employees working up to the
deferred retirement age can also be full members of the labour force through wage cost
subsidies and exemption arrangements for health care costs the government is trying to raise
the relatively low chances of finding a job for older workers but there are more bottlenecks
that are becoming more and more costly as the importance of older workers on the labour
market grows for example steep wage profiles and more generous fringe benefits in collective
labour agreements may make it relatively expensive to employ an older worker this is why
more flexibility in wage profiles and careers  including the option of demotion  may enhance
the labour market position of older workers


economic growth may benefit from a tax system adjustment owing to the marginal rates
and the current system of allowances some people gain little if they start working or work
more because different groups respond differently to tax incentives targeted policies may
stimulate the labour supply at the same time the system must not be made overly complex by
introducing differentiated rates and exceptions


the collective arrangements themselves also need maintenance currently curative care
insurance health insurance act  zorgverzekeringswet and longterm care insurance
social support act  wet maatschappelijke ondersteuning and longterm care act  wet
langdurige zorg are in danger of becoming increasingly expensive total care costs rose from
around 11 of gdp in 2000 to 16 of gdp in 2013 this rise ensued from both higher care
prices and care provision growing in volume because for example older people make out
a larger share of the population and prosperity has grown however there are also indications
that perverse incentives in the current funding system may result in excessive care provision
in particular since the termination of strict budgeting householdpaid contributions to care
used are often very low and for care providers cost effectiveness is not always considered as
an integral part of decisions about treatments there is a need for better incentives to promote
appropriate use of health care for both users and providers


124 shortterm policy
the above measures can structurally raise sustainable growth in the netherlands some may
also support shortterm economic growth health care system reforms can limit the rise in
collective health care premiums which would benefit the financial headroom of households
the latter also applies to pension system reform for example high pension contributions
prompt a review of the ambition of the second pillar of the pension system which has
become considerably more expensive in the current climate of low interest rates from a
macroeconomic perspective incomerelated pension contributions are desirable to avoid
excessive saving on top of that a system in which persons with relatively high incomes
pay gradually decreasing incomerelated pension contributions means that high earners

34   have to take on more responsibility for their own pensions these persons can take on this
     responsibility relatively well because they often enjoyed high levels of education own a house
     have substantial private assets and have better employment prospects at older age in addition
     the dutch economy will benefit if the rationalisation of the witteveen framework results in
     a reduction of pension contributions to the extent that the amount of pension contributions
     released by rationalisation is not needed to restore pension contributions to selffunding
     levels this may result in lower pension contributions for employees thus the adjustments
     could provide an impulse to households purchasing power differentiated wage movements
     with wage growth in sectors with financial headroom can also contribute to a welcome
     improvement of spending power


     in budgetary terms there is limited policy scope in the short term to promote economic
     growth while the netherlands may have exited the excessive deficit procedure in 2014
     the budget deficit is only edging down and government debt is expected to exceed the 60
     ceiling of the maastricht treaty in the next few years spending restraint in the health care
     sector and lower tax subsidies on pension savings will strengthen public finances on the other
     hand tax revenues will decrease as a result of lower taxes on labour this may be compensated
     by broadening the tax base and raising revenue from sales tax vat to promote the political
     feasibility of a tax system revision the government will have to use the available budgetary
     headroom as a political lubricant


     13   growing resilience of banks and finance for smes

     dutch banks are well on their way to comply with the basel iii capital and liquidity
     requirements and they are expected to be able to comply with the proposed additional
     lossabsorbing capacity requirements the influence of this on lending will be limited
     although the number of alternative sources of finance is growing quickly smes continue
     to depend heavily on bank finance accessible corporate information is important for the
     development of alternative sources of finance for smes


     131 higher capital requirements and their impact on lending
     the regular dnb monitoring shows that the dutch large banks are expected to comply in
     good time with the new capital requirements basel iii and capital requirements directive iv
     which will come into effect in 2019 this also applies to the supplementary national leverage
     ratio target of at least 4 by complying with these capital requirements the financial sector
     will contribute to a sustainable and stable economic development profits falling short of
     expectations pose the greatest threat to timely compliance with the new capital requirements
     should profits be worse than expected banks can limit their dividend payments or issue new
     capital so that lending to households and enterprises does not have to be at risk the new
     liquidity and funding requirements  in the form of the liquidity coverage ratio and net stable
     funding ratio respectively  also seems feasible

annual report




in the meantime new measures are being developed that will further strengthen the                  35
soundness of the financial system from 2015 dutch banks will contribute  partly on the basis
of risk indicators  to the new national deposit guarantee fund and the european resolution
fund banks are thus encouraged to improve their risk profile in addition the european
commission has proposed separating the traditional banking operations from the banks
trading activities this should reduce the risk of problems in one type of operation spreading to
the other contagion risk the basel committee is currently working on proposals to enhance
the comparability of capital ratios these proposals which went through public consultation in
late 2014 may in time result in a further increase of capital requirements for banks


in addition the financial stability board fsb has recently presented a proposal that would
require global systemically important banks to hold more capital on top of the new capital
requirements so that any losses in the event of bank failures can be absorbed the total loss
absorbing capacity tlac standard aims to raise lossabsorbing capital to enable an orderly
resolution of these banks without making claims on the public purse the proposal is consistent
with similar european requirements for all banks the minimum requirements for own funds
and eligible liabilities mrel section 34 takes a closer look at the new requirements


the intended increase in lossabsorbing capital may have consequences for corporate and
retail lending while the tlac and mrel requirements have not yet been finalised a provisional
estimate of their impact can be made on the assumption that the new requirements will only
have consequences for capital instruments and subordinated debt instruments that is because
these instruments provide more assurance that a bank in trouble has sufficient lossabsorbing
capital in place according to the provisional estimate the dutch large banks would need to
raise approximately eur 40 billion in additional capital instruments and subordinated debt
instruments in due course to comply with the intended lossabsorbing capacity requirements
that is equivalent to 2 of the banks total assets the phasein of the basel iii capital
requirements will reduce the amount needed somewhat because those capital instruments
also qualify as lossabsorbing capital


banks can comply with the proposed new requirements in two ways firstly they can build up
more lossabsorbing capital by retaining earnings if available or by issuing qualifying capital
or debt instruments issuing subordinated debt instruments is expected to be cheaper than
raising additional share capital debt issuance is more attractive from a tax perspective and
less unfavourable for a banks return on equity secondly banks would be able to meet the
proposed requirements by reducing their balance sheets given that the requirements are
expressed as a percentage of the balance sheet total however compliance with the proposed
capital requirements would imply balance sheet adjustments at a scale that would affect
profitable activities from a macroeconomic perspective too this does not seem to be an
attractive approach

36   all things considered banks are expected to issue mainly subordinated debt instruments to
     strengthen their lossabsorbing capital position in a steady balance sheet situation this would
     boil down to replacing existing senior uncovered debt instruments with subordinated debt
     historically the financing costs of subordinated debt have been higher than those of senior
     debt see chart 14 as a result banks total funding costs are expected to rise although they
     will be offset to a limited extent if the senior debt risk premium declines

     note risk premium relates to the return above the riskfree interest rate on
           eurodenominated bank bonds




     whether higher bank funding costs will have consequences for lending depends on the
     extent to which banks pass such costs on to customers through higher interest rates
     in the netherlands all large banks are expected to be affected by the proposed additional
     requirements the fact that global systemically important banks gsibs have to meet the new
     requirements raises the likelihood that the financing costs can be passed on smaller banks
     may even benefit from this development because the difference in financing costs between
     sibs and nonsibs will decrease it is likely that the proposed additional lossabsorbing capacity
     requirements will result in the average loan becoming slightly more expensive which would
     hamper lending to households and enterprises to a limited extent this effect can be mitigated
     by phasing in the new requirements

132 importance of market funding increases mainly for large companies                               37
while the share of market funding has risen since the financial crisis hovering at around 24 at
the end of 2014 dutch companies have continued to depend strongly on banks it is primarily
large companies that have turned to market funding for example capital market debt issue
amounts averaged at approximately eur 350 million in 2014 the high fixed costs of market
funding and the fact that investors lack a clear understanding of the financial resilience of
mediumsized and smaller enterprises constitute important obstacles to market funding from
the perspective of financial stability and sustainable economic development diversification of
sources of finance is desirable including for smes


in the third quarter of 2014 bank lending to smes was 43 below the level in the previous
year this decrease is partly because some smes currently have solvency levels below their
precrisis levels which hampers the availability of bank finance these enterprises mainly need
to strengthen their equity position another factor is that dutch smes  unlike foreign smes 
relatively often seek to finance their inventories or working capital rather than their capital
investment however applications for working capital finance are turned down considerably
more often than for example loan applications related to business accommodation
one explanation is that risks and returns for working capital finance are harder to determine
than for capital investment finance


133 alternative sources of finance on the rise
alternative sources of finance may very well complement the existing supply of finance for
smes there is a growing supply of alternative sources of both debt and equity financing
including crowdfunding platforms and credit unions these alternatives are growing fast
for example 2014 saw crowdfunding double versus 2013 to eur 63 million more than 80 of
which was used to finance companies even so their size  in absolute terms  will be limited
for some time


the emergence of electronic data processing has resulted in banks assessing their credit risks
increasingly on the basis of specific predetermined criteria which has also caused a shift in the
banking business model with relationship banking playing a less prominent role compared
with large companies there is little public information about individual smes making it difficult
for financiers to conduct a risk assessment in addition enterprises are not always able to
provide the information that is necessary for a proper assessment of their creditworthiness
improving the availability of business information may therefore contribute to broadening
the financing options for smes to this end various initiatives have been launched one very
good example is sbr standard business reporting a publicprivate project aimed at giving
investors access to business information in a standardised way and with company approval
furthermore surveys reveal that sme awareness of alternative sources of finance and existing
government measures may be raised

38    14       monetary policy and economic recovery in the euro area

      due to low economic growth and inflation the unconventional monetary policy measures
      were expanded in 2014 and early 2015 sustainably higher levels of growth and inflation also
      require effective fiscal and structural measures these supplementary measures will reduce the
      pressure on the eurosystem to pursue an accommodative monetary policy and should in the
      end enable the phasing out of the unconventional monetary measures


      141 inflation developments and monetary policy
      the slow economic recovery in the euro area is accompanied by low inflation the rate of
      increase of the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp has been well below 2 since
      2013 and is expected to remain below the ecb target in 20152016 with the underutilisation
      of capacity being one of the contributing factors looking at the hicp components the decline
      in energy prices  notably oil prices  has been the main factor driving inflation down
      see chart 15 core inflation which excludes volatile components such as energy
      is considerably more stable and saw hardly any further decline in 2014


      low average inflation in the euro area goes hand in hand with deflation in some member
      states in 2014 there were five euro area countries where consumer prices declined on an
      annualised basis in particular countries that have been hit hardest by the debt crisis this is

partly the result of a necessary adjustment of relative prices and accompanying structural             39
changes in the sectoral composition of output the latter enhances the productivity and
competitiveness of these countries however amid persistently low inflation relative
price adjustments are slower to materialise which means that the competitive position of
deficit countries will improve only slowly low inflation or deflation also means that debts
and interest rates continue to be at high levels in real terms spain and italy for example
saw nominal lending rates decline at a slower pace than expected inflation which resulted in
a rise in real lending rates for enterprises in 2013


longterm inflation expectations have gradually fallen below 2 which shows that inflation
expectations are less firmly anchored than in the past this reflects the increased risk of a
prolonged low inflation level however there is no sign of classic deflation in the sense of self
reinforcing price slides accompanied by a sharply contracting economy due to the declining
inflation outlook partly the result of the slow economic recovery the ecb has further eased
its monetary policy in june and september 2014 the policy rate was lowered in two stages to
only five basis points and the deposit rate was set at a negative level up to 20 basis points
the policy rate reduction has gradually translated into lower lending rates in 2014 nominal
lending rates for euro area households and enterprises declined to an average of approximately
05 percentage point the accommodative monetary policy has also contributed to the
depreciation of the euro between april 2014 and endjanuary 2015 11 in nominal effective
terms and 19 visàvis the us dollar a key factor here was that the markets anticipated
a future interest rate increase by the federal reserve while the ecb has communicated that
the policy rate will remain low for a long time


beyond the policy rate cuts new unconventional monetary measures were also taken
here the emphasis has shifted from support for bank funding  such as by the full allocation
of liquidity at a fixed interest rate and longterm refinancing operations  towards influencing
lending operations and the economy in a more targeted way one of the new instruments
the targeted longerterm refinancing operations  tltros gives banks an incentive to use
the eurosystem funding for corporate lending the low interest rate on this longterm facility
can result in further lending rate cuts and encourage demand for credit in 2014 banks already
borrowed well over eur 200 billion under the tltros and they can use the facility until 2018
in late 2014 the eurosystem also began to purchase covered bonds issued by financial institutions
under its covered bond purchase programme cbpp3 and assetbacked securities under its
abspp programme


early 2015 it was decided to expand the purchase programme to include bonds issued by
governments and european institutions the aim is that the eurosystem will purchase bonds
including bonds under its cbpp3 and abspp programmes worth eur 60 billion every month
from march 2015 to september 2016 the purchase programme is aimed at bringing inflation
close to the 2 target in the medium term this will be done in various ways for example
the largescale programme reinforces the perception of a monetary policy that will be very

40   accommodating for some time to come in response this allows market interest rates to decline
     asset prices to rise and the exchange rate to depreciate rising asset prices can feed through into
     expenditures and a depreciation of the euro supports exports thus the purchase programme has
     a stimulating effect on the economy the purchase programme also has an impact on financial
     markets in the broadest sense if investors replace the government paper sold by longerterm
     or riskier investments as a result longterm interest rates and risk premiums will decline
     the favourable effects on the financial markets will ultimately translate into lower lending rates
     and higher lending volumes by banks which will have a positive impact on expenditure and thus
     inflation however the size of the effects expected from the purchase programme is uncertain


     142 need for supplementary fiscal and structural policy
     all in all the eurosystem has taken a large number of conventional and unconventional
     measures since the financial crisis and the limits of what can be done are in sight an additional
     issue is the growing risk of negative side effects associated with the measures a prolonged
     accommodative monetary policy may increase the danger of new financial imbalances
     or can lead to misallocation of capital if bad loans for example are rolled over time after time
     see section 15 a sustained and higherthanexpected level of growth and inflation requires a
     combination of accommodative monetary policy and effective measures in other policy areas


     under the new fiscal rules most countries will have limited budgetary headroom according
     to the european commissions latest economic projections next years budget deficits in most
     countries will be below the maastricht treaty limit of 3 of gdp at the same time however
     many countries continue to have alarmingly high debt levels see chart 16 in addition
     the credibility of the recently tightened european fiscal rules is at stake now that countries like
     france and italy are at risk of noncompliance an overall weakening of rules is undesirable


     a fiscal incentive in the euro area to strengthen the business cycle and economic structure
     should therefore come from specific countries or from the composition of national budgets
     countries may for instance increase the impact of fiscal policy on growth by shifting the tax
     burden from labour to consumption or by rate reductions in exchange for tax base broadening
     see also section 124 as regards the composition of expenditure raising public investment is
     worth considering because many emu countries have seen this expenditure category
      which is important to structural reinforcement  decline in recent years public investment
     is most effective in countries with lowquality infrastructures as is the case  according to
     indicators  in countries like ireland and italy or countries whose infrastructures are in decline
     such as in france germany and belgium thorough costbenefit analyses play an important
     role here the claim on public finances can be reduced by financing public investment partially
     through publicprivate cooperation or at european level the recent plan of president of the
     european commission juncker to invest more than eur 300 billion ie 22 of the eus gdp
     through private participation and the european investment bank may have a positive effect on
     economic growth albeit that much will depend on its implementation

these monetary and fiscal measures should be reinforced by measures taken on the supply
side of the economy the financial sector has already seen farreaching measures such as
implementation of basel iii the banking union and the comprehensive assessment of european
banks balance sheets in other areas however there is still ample scope for further structural
reforms although especially countries benefiting from financial support programmes have
clearly made progress since 2011 they still lag well behind other european countries and
for example the unites states and the united kingdom in terms of labour market and product
market efficiency see chart 17 the relative positions of a number of european countries have
even deteriorated in the period 20112014 because the efficiency improvement of their labour
and product markets lagged behind that of the other countries


regrettably the pace of reform has fallen off again in recent years with large countries such
as france and italy at risk of lagging behind useful reforms worth considering include further
curbing employment protection in fixed employment contracts spain france implementing a
more activating labour market policy ireland or liberalising network sectors portugal
and regulated professions such as lawyers france italy the quality of government and the
efficiency of the legal system also warrant improvement for example in italy

     reforms can be aimed more directly at growth now that the main divergences in current
     account balances and competitiveness have been reduced considerably per capita gdp in
     the euro area is currently more than 30 below the us level and is at risk of lagging 40
     behind the united states in 2023 according to the european commission according to
     international institutions including the oecd the upward effects of reforms on potential
     output are considerable up to an average of 6 of gdp in the euro area europe can reduce
     the gap in for example innovation by eliminating growth restrictions for small and new
     enterprises new technologies can also be applied more quickly by making services sectors
     more competitive and improving the quality of professional education and practical training
     also there is much to be gained from further reinforcing the european internal market
     this can for example be achieved by improving the application of the services directive
     the directive provides some policy discretion which has resulted in many countries lagging
     in terms of removing crossborder restrictions to the full extent possible according to the
     european commission a further removal could increase potential output by up to 16
     in addition the internal market could be further extended in specific sectors for example
     there are still quite some crossborder restrictions in place in road and rail transport and
     energy for example because the physical infrastructures are not always aligned other areas
     where the internal market could be strengthened include digital services such as online sales
     or regulated professions such as lawyers civillaw notaries or auditors finally strengthening

143 importance of reforms for monetary policy
the structural and institutional reforms help strengthen the economy and the banking sector in
the euro area this is important for the eurosystem for a number of reasons one reason is that
the reforms reduce the need to pursue a prolonged accommodative monetary policy a policy
that may be accompanied by negative side effects see section 15 as a result of growth
enhancing measures by other authorities countering low inflation is no longer a matter of
monetary policy only in addition the improving financial position of households enterprises
and financial institutions will remove bottlenecks in monetary transmission as a result
monetary policy will become more effective which means that the same effect can be achieved
with less monetary stimulus ultimately the reforms make it easier to gradually phase out the
accommodating monetary measures as soon as the economic and financial situation allows this


it is important that monetary policy does not reduce the incentives to reforms monetary policy
may buy time but cannot resolve structural problems other authorities should therefore use
that time to make adjustments aimed at improving the economic fundamentals in order
to encourage such authorities to do this conditions may be attached to accommodating
monetary measures this was the case for the outright monetary transactions omts
developed in 2012 which while never activated featured the condition that the government
whose government paper would be purchased had to carry out an euimf support programme
the purchase programme for sovereign bonds and bonds issued by eu public bodies that was
announced in early 2015 is not subject to conditions in respect of government policy still risk
sharing applies only to the bonds of european institutions and to 8 of the sovereign bonds
which means that the likelihood of redistribution of risks on government paper through the
central bank balance sheet are limited this limited risksharing may help in keeping pressure
on governments to reform their economies


another favourable effect of the institutional reforms and stricter rules for the financial sector
is that it reduces the risk of the eurosystem having to provide prolonged liquidity support
to banks for example the banking union the use of macroprudential instruments and the
stricter liquidity and capital ratios have raised the trust in the robustness of the banking sector
and thus lending the comprehensive assessment of european banks balance sheets has
also contributed to this to restore banks in financial trouble to health quickly the european
resolution authority now has several resolution instruments at its disposal these reforms
should reduce the frequency and duration of any periods during which a bank no longer has
access to other sources of finance

44   15    accommodative monetary policy and impact on financial stability

     the accommodative monetary policy has contributed to divergence in economic and financial
     developments it has resulted in disorderly pricing in some financial market segments
     central banks consider the negative side effects of monetary measures including risks to
     financial stability in their policies macroprudential instruments can counter these side effects
     to a limited extent


     151 divergence in economic and financial cycles
     the eurosystem has taken further unconventional measures to support economic dynamics
     see section 14 however the transmission of the monetary policy to the real economy
     is restricted by the balance sheet recession in the euro area a result of high debts in the
     economy and balance sheet restrictions at banks in addition the expenditure and demand
     for credit are depressed by uncertainty among enterprises and households this is contrary to
     the developments on the financial markets where the accommodative monetary policy has
     contributed to low volatility and rising asset prices viewed in this light the real and financial
     cycles have increasingly diverged and investor sentiment is more positive than that among
     businesses and households see chart 18 in other words there is an increasing gap between
     the financial developments and the real economic outlook


     the ample liquidity conditions are reflected in investors growing risk appetites as a result of
     the continuing presence of central banks in financial markets market parties regard the risks
     of significant negative price developments in a wide range of investment categories as smaller
     the monetary measures have created an illusion that liquidity will be available permanently
     however the stagnation of the financial markets and the abrupt price adjustments in
     midoctober 2014 showed that market liquidity can quickly dry up in a stress situation


     the pursued monetary policy which has contributed to ample availability of financial resources
     and low interest rates has encouraged a search for yield in financial markets some market
     segments are showing signs of bubble creation this was also recognised in dnbs overview
     of financial stability in the autumn of 2014 as a result of the intensified search for yield share
     prices have risen considerably in recent years the priceearnings ratios of american shares
     have risen to levels above longterm averages this is an indication that financial market
     developments are not consistent with the profit development of companies the intensified
     search for yield has also resulted in riskier and more leveraged investments this has resulted
     in a sharp rise in the interest rate sensitivity of investment portfolios all in all the risk has
     increased that a future tightening of the federal reserves monetary policy will result in sharp
     stock exchange adjustments


     the low interest rates and investors growing risk appetites have brought about a sharp rise
     in demand for riskier bonds with relatively high yields this has resulted in interest rates on
     sovereign bonds of vulnerable countries and that of businesses with a reduced creditworthiness

falling to historically low levels see chart 19 by contrast the debt ratios of the countries and                   45
businesses concerned remain high which is an indication that there is a disconnect between
what is happening in financial markets versus the real economy this has increased the risk of
a sharp adjustment if participants are forced to sell securities in such a scenario investors can
suffer large losses and prices may enter a downward spiral should this occur on a wide scale
this would pose a risk to financial stability and thus to the real economy

152 policy considerations
the eurosystem weighs up the contribution of the accommodative monetary policy to
economic recovery and price stability against the risks of growing financial imbalances
these are included in the monetary analysis on which decisionmaking is based one of the
considerations is that the accommodative monetary policy can buy time which private parties
and governments can and should use to repair their balance sheets and implement reforms
optimism among investors may indicate that they expect the economic fundamentals to
improve for one thing a number of euro area countries should structurally adjust their
economies to avoid betrayal of market confidence see section 14

46   another risk of longterm accommodative monetary policy is that disrupted price
     determination and incentives may cause a misallocation of resources this too may
     undermine longterm financial stability in addition persistently low interest rates may affect
     the supply side of the economy one of the dangers of prolonged low interest rates is that
     it accommodates finance for unproductive investments and the rollover of bad loans as a
     consequence the necessary adjustments in the economy are postponed at the expense of
     productivity and enterprises become more vulnerable to interest rate increases


     while being an effective way of reducing the risk appetite in financial markets a tighter
     monetary policy is currently not the appropriate measure to counter the growing imbalances
     given the outlook of persistently low inflation at the same time the eurosystem considers
     the risks of financial imbalances and market disruptions in the design and implementation
     of monetary policy measures including new unconventional measures to support lending to
     enterprises such as the tltros and the purchase programmes


     153 the role of macroprudential policy
     the main aim of macroprudential instruments is to enhance the shock resilience of the financial
     system as a result sudden changes in market sentiment and sharp asset price adjustments
     can be absorbed in addition these instruments which are disconnected from monetary policy
     and can be aimed at specific sectors contribute to a reduction of the financial imbalances
     that accompany the accommodative monetary policy in recent years new macroprudential
     instruments have been developed for example as part of the prudential rules for banks in
     europe many european countries have recently activated one or more macroprudential
     instruments see table 12 with measures in some of these countries these are in particular
     economies in which house prices and mortgage lending have increased considerably such as
     belgium norway the united kingdom sweden and switzerland


     the netherlands has also taken macroprudential measures which were set out in the overview
     of financial stability in the autumn of 2014 however these measures are aimed not so much
     at imbalances related to the accommodative monetary policy but at structurally increasing
     the buffers in the financial system ing rabobank abn amro and sns must hold additional
     capital buffers  3 for the first three and 1 for sns  because they have been classified
     as systemically important institutions and thus pose an increased risk to financial stability
     the intended increase in the leverage ratio to 4 for these institutions in 2018 is also worth
     mentioning here because this will raise the resilience of systemically important institutions
     in addition the maximum ltv ratio for house purchases will be reduced in stages  by one
     percentage point each year  to 100 in 2018 these are structural measures that will
     sustainably strengthen the financial system

there are limitations as to how macroprudential policy can mitigate the risks of financial
imbalances these specific measures can never fully redress the generic incentives that ensue
from the accommodative monetary policy the effectiveness of macroprudential policy is also
limited because of the nature of the current  largely crossborder  risks in the financial
markets that is why countering these imbalances through macroprudential policy requires
farreaching international coordination another reason for macroprudential policys limitations
in redressing the imbalances is that most instruments relate to banks while the risks of bubble
creation and the intensified search for yield manifest themselves in the financial markets
and also affect nonbanking parties such as institutional investors this aspect is compounded
by the ongoing shift of finance activities from the banking sector to nonbank institutions
that is why it is important to develop instruments with broader scopes than the current
instruments it is conceivable that instruments aimed at banks can be deployed for nonbanks
by imposing limits on the size of exposures in certain markets or of credit lines to nonbanks
also instruments that are aimed outside the banking system may be considered such as
haircuts and margin requirements for certain transactions in financial markets in international
bodies such as the fsb and the european systemic risk board dnb is working with other
central banks and supervisory authorities to develop these instruments

48   experience with the use of macroprudential instruments is still limited especially in the current
     environment of low economic growth it is therefore all the more important that the existing
     and new instruments are aimed at actual imbalances and do not hamper the financing of
     highrisk productive investment

21   introduction                                                                                51


over recent years the foundation has been laid for strengthening the
robustness of financial institutions and creating a stronger supervisory
system the efforts to restore trust will need to bear fruit in the coming
period priorities in this regard are the further development of the single
supervisory mechanism ssm and the transition to new supervisory regimes
such as the european capital adequacy rules and regulations for banks
crd ivcrr and insurers solvency ii and the new financial assessment
framework ftk for pension funds transparency and integrity are also key
conditions for a sustainable financial sector and financial institutions will
have to continue adapting to the changing market climate in order to ensure
that their business models remain viable

a major reform agenda was drawn up in response to the financial crisis muchneeded changes
were made to national and international regulations to increase the robustness of financial
institutions and improve the quality of their risk management and operations the creation of
the european banking union marks another important step towards stronger supervision and
breaking the negative spiral between banks and governments


the public body accountability report which will be published simultaneously with this
annual report reviews developments in supervision over the past year this chapter of the
annual report focuses on the challenges that lie ahead for supervision of the financial sector
section 22 describes the next steps in building an effective single supervisory mechanism
after a successful start the year ahead will be characterised by the actual implementation of
single supervision as well as by gaining experience with and further developing the procedures
and methodology for the ssm section 23 discusses the elements needed for the sustainable
restoration of trust based on a balanced weighing of interests by robust institutions acting
with due care and integrity finally section 24 explores how futureproof the different
sectors are institutions need to adapt their business models and strategies such that they
accommodate developments going forward also in the long term

52   22    next steps in european banking supervision

     the ssm came into effect on 4 november 2014 the creation of a new governance structure
     within the ecb and the completion of the comprehensive assessment marked a successful start
     to the launch dnb is a great advocate of european banking supervision which will also lead to
     a number of practical changes supervision will be more intensive and more emphasis will be
     placed on harmonising supervisory regimes besides continued focus on sustainable business
     models and profitability of banks


     the financial crisis made clear that the existing national supervisory structures were no longer
     adequate against the backdrop of financial integration in europe at the height of the crisis
     it became evident that financial problems in the banking sector can lead to fiscal problems in
     a member state  and the converse can also be true in addition national problems can have
     direct implications for the euro area as a whole a fundamental overhaul of the supervisory
     system was needed to continue guaranteeing financial stability in europe with this in mind
     government leaders decided in june 2012 to create a european banking union


     the banking union rests on three pillars the first is the single supervisory mechanism ssm
     which involves close collaboration between the ecb and national supervisory authorities
     such as dnb the ecb bears ultimate responsibility for european banking supervision and
     directly supervises 123 significant banks which together account for 82 of the total banking
     assets in the euro area in addition national supervisors supervise the other approximately
     3500 banks the second pillar is the single resolution mechanism srm which provides for
     the orderly resolution of financial institutions in difficulties for details see chapter 3 the third
     pillar is the creation of a european deposit guarantee scheme the reform of the relevant
     european directive marks the first step towards the required harmonisation but the european
     commission has yet to come up with more detailed proposals


     the first pillar the ssm took just over two years to become operational this was a complex
     operation that was carried through with unprecedented speed european regulations came
     about to provide the statutory basis for the ssm and a legal framework for the collaboration
     between the ecb and national supervisory authorities a new supervisory methodology was
     also developed determining how supervision will be carried out within the ssm the ecb
     published a summary of this methodology in its guide to banking supervision a new division
     has been created within the ecb for which nearly 800 staff have been recruited


     in the runup to the launch of the ssm a comprehensive assessment was performed to
     gauge the strength of the banking sector entailing an asset quality review aqr and a stress
     test the aqr looked at whether the measurement of banks assets was prudent the stress
     test involved an extrapolation of a scenario with a series of negative economic shocks
     the comprehensive assessment marked a milestone in the buildup to european banking
     supervision and provided a muchneeded perspective on the quality of bank balance sheets

annual report




the assessment revealed that the financial position of dutch banks is robust enough to enable       53
them to make the transition to the ssm and that they are sufficiently capitalised to remain
above the threshold values in situations of severe stress


the successful launch of the ssm and the comprehensive assessment have laid a solid foundation
for the restoration of trust what is important now is to press ahead and to ensure that the
ecb and national supervisors operate from a position of strength within the ssm and work
together effectively as a single organisation


the ssm pools the strengths of the ecb and the national supervisors european supervision
also imposes discipline on the member states in question and approaches supervision from
a european perspective thereby contributing to effective decisionmaking moreover
the good reputation of the ecb provides authority to european supervision the ecb brings
its knowledge information and experience to bear allowing it to benefit from synergy effects
the ecb mandate for the entire euro area also makes it easier to compare banks across
member states thus strengthening the quality and consistency of the supervision


dnb is now a member of a european system of supervisors joint supervision teams supervise
significant institutions coordinated by the ecb dnb mainly carries out supervisory tasks and
retains primary responsibility for the supervision of relatively small institutions a number
of specific aspects such as integrity remain the responsibility of the national supervisors
the shift from national to european supervision implies that dnb now also shares responsibility
for the supervision of all major banks across the euro area joint decisions are taken via the
supervisory board the ssm policymaking body in which all national supervisory authorities
including dnb are represented dnb will also use the ssm to strengthen its own supervision
and will conversely contribute its expertise and experience to aid in the development of the
ssm the aim is to ensure that key elements in dnbs supervisory activities such as liquidity
supervision supervision of conduct and culture supervision of business models and strategy
the link between macroeconomic risks and microprudential supervision and screenings are also
effectively embedded in the supervision by the ecb this is one of the reasons why dnb seeks
to be represented as broadly as possible within the ssm particularly in key strategic positions


at yearend 2014 more than 20 dnb staff had joined the ssm organisation at the ecb
there were also a number of temporary secondments to support the launch of the organisation
and the development of the new supervisory methodology easy twoway mobility strengthens
the collaboration within the ssm and ensures better staff development dnb aims to ensure
that it is sufficiently involved and represented in the ssm organisation so as to guarantee that
there is adequate knowledge and understanding of the dutch market dnb maintains close
contacts through formal and informal networks and mutual visits


but the success achieved so far is only the beginning the ambitions for the ssm are high and
will lead to a number of changes

54   first of all supervision is set to become more intensive the ecb sets high standards for
     continuous supervisory assessments as shown for instance in an increase in the volume
     of onsite inspections these onsite visits usually have a specific focus they may look at
     financial risks in certain loan portfolios as in the comprehensive assessment they may also
     be concerned with operational risks ict risks or business practices such frequent onsite
     inspections already form part of the normal supervision practice in other european countries
     and dnb has now also set up a special division for this purpose the demands placed on data
     quality and analysis are also rising considerably as the ecb supervision makes greater use of
     statistical comparisons and quantitative analyses finally the ssm will lead to an intensification
     of the supervision of internal models dnbs current supervision model starts from a riskbased
     approach based on an annual highlevel assessment of the use of internal models by supervised
     institutions supplemented with analyses in the event of significant changes to existing models
     or the introduction of new models the ecb approach requires more capacity which will be
     deployed on a continuous basis to examine the data used by the supervised institution the use
     of internal models and the management environment within the bank in question


     secondly the ecb will prioritise the harmonisation of national supervisory regimes local
     supervisors currently take widely differing approaches to supervision for instance in their annual
     assessment of capital adequacy and operations  srep  which means that international
     comparison is not always easy the ecb wants to create a more level playing field by
     introducing greater consistency in the application of options and freedoms currently open to
     supervisors in their supervision based on the national implementation of the european capital
     requirements directive crd iv the ecb also seeks to strengthen the european supervision
     of nonsignificant institutions through the further development and harmonisation of the
     methodology and supervisory approach


     thirdly much attention will remain focused on sustainable business models for banks and
     ensuring profitability the banking sector is still in a state of flux and the profitability of
     business models is under pressure like dnb the ecb attaches great importance to analysing
     how banks respond to changing circumstances and how they adapt their business models to
     ensure they remain structurally sound and profitable

23   sustainable restoration of trust                                                              55


a stable financial sector contributes to sustainable economic prosperity the new regulatory
frameworks for banks insurers and pension funds will increase the financial robustness of
institutions and help ensure a balanced weighing of the interests of different stakeholders
in its supervisory strategy 20142018 dnb also presents a clear set of ambitions relating to the
integrity and transparency needed to restore trust in the financial sector the first steps have
already been taken and further progress will be made in the years ahead


231 implementation of riskbased supervisory framework
major progress was made in 2014 in the international reform agenda with agreement on the
establishment of new supervisory regimes in all sectors over the coming period attention will
be focused on timely preparations for these new regimes and ensuring a smooth transition


the revised european capital adequacy rules and regulations for banks and investment firms
crd ivcrr came into effect in 2014 the new regulations impose requirements for higher
capital buffers and improved bank solvency and liquidity they also strengthen bank risk
management systems for example by imposing stricter rules on risk weightings and enhanced
risk reporting requirements the regulations allow banks to move in phases towards building
the envisaged capital buffers dnb is working with the ecb to monitor banks progress in duly
meeting these requirements the ecb has announced that it will also look carefully at banks
dividend policies


after years of international debate good progress has also been made on the introduction
of the new european framework for insurance supervision  solvency ii  with effect from 1
january 2016 dnb sees this as a crucial development because it is an important step towards
stronger more riskbased and forwardlooking supervision ensuring a smooth and well
considered transition of insurance supervision to the new framework will therefore be a key
activity in the year ahead supported by the significant preparatory steps that have been taken
in recent years


the introduction of the new financial assessment framework in the pensions sector will bring
a muchneeded technical update and increase the financial viability of supplementary pensions
pensions will become more shockresistant by applying a longer period for smoothing
out financial setbacks in addition amendments to the rules governing pension funds recovery
plans give these funds more time to adapt their investment policy which is not unwelcome
from a macroeconomic perspective either pensions will also become more stable by setting
conditions for indexation and adjusting the method of calculating the funding ratio
the assessment framework also ensures that financial ups and downs are shared in a balanced
way across different generations

56   as well as tightening the regulations the supervisory approach has also been strengthened
     over recent years dnb has performed a cultural shift towards more intrusive and more
     conclusive supervision the annual stakeholder analysis that dnb commissions from an
     independent expert shows that supervised institutions clearly perceive this intensification
     of supervision there is also greater emphasis on enforcement from analysis to action
     and greater willingness to impose formal measures in order to enforce the desired changes
     in addition there are procedures in which dnbs enforcement measures are being assessed
     by the courts




        box 21 screening of policymakers

        dnbs statutory assessments of the suitability and integrity of policymakers are an
        important tool in guaranteeing the quality of management at financial institutions
        and therefore the trust in the financial sector dnb fosters a rigorous decisionmaking
        process by creating clear expectations removing misunderstandings and adopting clear
        procedures with adequate internal and external safeguards


        a total of 1737 executive directors supervisory board members and policymakers of
        supervised financial institutions were screened in 2014 the focus in these assessments
        is on both knowledge and skills in 13 of cases an application was formally denied
        or the application was withdrawn before dnb reached that decision candidates
        may be ruled unsuitable for several reasons an important reason for rejection is
        that candidates are insufficiently prepared for the role and have done too little to
        familiarise themselves with their specific tasks the institution in question or the
        relevant regulations they therefore lack the knowledge experience or skills needed to
        fulfil the role other common flaws are a lack of competencies such as responsibility
        judgement or independence


        in addition to reviewing individual suitability in assessing a candidates suitability
        dnb also looks at the composition and quality of the board as a whole there needs
        to be a balanced distribution of knowledge and experience within an executive board
        or supervisory board a lack of diversity on the board for instance in terms of age or
        background can also play a role in a rejection


        candidates are only rejected after careful screening when matters are complex or
        in case of doubt several meetings are held at various levels within dnb candidates
        are rejected only after broad and careful consideration those affected can go through
        the usual channels to contest or appeal against a decision by dnb

232 integrity                                                                                       57
lack of integrity has undermined the reputation of the financial sector in recent years dnb
regards trust in financial institutions and their executives as an essential condition for the
operation of the financial sector supervision of integrity an explicit statutory duty of dnb
will therefore receive prominent attention in the years ahead with a particular focus on
preventing and combating financial and economic crime such as financing terrorism breaching
sanctions and money laundering conflicts of interest will also be investigated ie situations
where decisions are influenced by personal interests or by professional interests other than
those of the institution concerned


financial institutions both in the netherlands and elsewhere have been involved in several
cases of manipulating market data fraud facilitating moneylaundering and circumventing
sanctions financial institutions have a statutory duty to prevent becoming involved in situations
that undermine their integrity that involvement can take different forms it may involve lack
of integrity in the conduct of employees but it can also pertain to the institution itself eg
with respect to the duty to act transparently and not engage in misselling finally financial
institutions have a duty to prevent becoming involved in breaches of integrity by clients


an incident involving integrity affects not just the institution concerned but the entire sector
the direct impact on an institution may consist of high fines legal fees claims a halt on
new business takeover restrictions recovery costs and loss of clients in addition breaches of
integrity often stem from a weak risk culture which in itself brings further prudential risks
integrity incidents also undermine trust in the financial sector in general and can have an
adverse impact on the orderly operation of financial markets finally financial and economic
crime such as deliberate or unintentional facilitation of money laundering can have an impact
on the integrity of the regular economy and public safety


integrity supervision is constantly evolving in order to respond better to developments in
the sector dnb is working towards better identification of integrity risks improving the
analysis of these risks and intensifying the collaboration within the financial expertise centre
fec a partnership between authorities that have supervisory control prosecution or
investigation powers in the financial sector dnb concentrates on the early identification of
new developments in relation to integrity regular trend reports are an important tool in this
context they quickly reveal an overarching picture the sharing of information within dnb
has been stepped up and ways are being sought of improving the way in which professionals
report breaches of integrity dnb will also continue to investigate dnb themes such as
sanctions corruption and management of integrity risks in crosssectoral projects


233 transparency
dnb aims for maximally possible transparency of supervision so as to provide a clear picture of
the stability of the financial sector and the way in which dnb fulfils its mission accountability
is a major factor in dnbs public role it contributes to the restoration of trust in the financial

58   sector the comprehensive assessment by the ecb and the european banking authority eba
     illustrates this perfectly openness enhances the effectiveness of supervision through
     communication about issues risks and desirable developments the limits of transparency
     are defined by confidentiality requirements which prohibit the publication of confidential
     institutionspecific information dnb will not publish any information that could cause
     unnecessary harm to an institutions robustness to individuals or to financial stability


     the strategic priorities of supervision are described in dnbs mission and ambitions
     the supervisory strategy 20142018 the action plan for cultural change the brochure on
     the focus approach to supervision and the ecb guide to banking supervision these priorities
     are translated into the public body accountability budget and the annual thematic supervision
     brochure in which dnb publishes its planned activities and deliverables


     dnb reports on the status of these activities during the year and provides an understanding
     of the outcomes in the public body accountability report and in specific publications such as
     the monthly newsletters and dnbulletins publications in the past year include forward studies
     of the insurance and pensions sector and a critical review of trusts dnb has also published
     information memoranda on its activities and supervisory findings in a number of cases
     including the aqrs of commercial real estate the libor affair and the nationalisation of sns
     reaal a dutch bank the effectiveness of dnbs supervision is also subject to regular internal
     and external review and an annual stakeholder analysis is carried out to ascertain what
     financial institutions think about dnbs performance


     steps are being taken in liaison with the dutch banking association nvb and relevant banks
     to facilitate the publication of institutionspecific information on the dnb website something
     that is already being done for insurers the dutch minister of social affairs and employment
     has also proposed legislation that will make it possible to publish information about individual
     pension funds


     and there is more that dnb wants to do dnb can use transparency more actively as a tool
     to promote the effectiveness of supervision when defining the supervisory approach and
     planning interventions dnb will take greater account of whether targeted communication can
     contribute to better supervision it is also important that financial institutions are clear about
     the purpose and envisaged effects of dnbs supervisory activities supervision is most effective
     when the priorities and expectations of the supervisor are clear institutions also need to be
     given structural feedback on findings and areas where improvement is required regulations
     policy and the supervisory approach should be accessible the regulations have become more
     complex over recent years and there is an important role for dnb to play in providing clarity on
     relevant information about legislation and regulations and its supervisory approach this will
     make it easier for institutions to meet the requirements

annual report




dnb will also continue its efforts to increase the transparency of the ssm and will look to            59
work with the ecb to make the most of opportunities for transparency some aspects of
european banking supervision are already very transparent as reflected for instance in the
sharing of detailed anonymised reports of supervisory board meetings with the members of
the european parliament the rendering of account to the eurogroup and the proposed direct
contacts with national parliaments


24 sustainability of business models

a sustainable financial sector is one that is able to meet its obligations both now and in the
future that is why dnb looks not only at the present situation but also at the interests
of depositors policyholders and pension fund members going forward major changes are
expected over the longer term in the structure scale and competitiveness of various sectors
and rules and regulations will need to keep pace financial institutions need to respond quickly
to changes by adapting and futureproofing their strategies and business models


241 structure of the banking sector
supervision contributes to stable and efficient banking services the structure of the banking
sector is also a key point for dnb in ensuring the sustainability of the dutch banking sector
decisive factors such as the scale and extent of the competition have an impact on the stability
and efficiency of banking services a stable financial sector is able to absorb external shocks and
is not itself a source of shocks or imbalances banks need to have sustainable business models
and the banking sector should be resilient with a healthy structure and efficient service delivery
as the legislative authority the government plays a decisive role in the area of tax and
prudential regulation


the dutch banking sector stands out for its large size and high degree of concentration
although the sector has contracted since the onset of the crisis it remains large in relation to
the dutch economy both historically and internationally chart 21 shows that the total assets
of the dutch banking sector are more than four times as large as dutch gdp


a large sector is not by definition problematic but may be a sign that the stability or efficiency
of banking services is under pressure the crucial question is what underlying factors cause the
sector to be so large a sector that has grown due to a high risk appetite on the part of banks
can put strains on the stability of the system the relaxation of the mortgage lending criteria by
dutch banks from the 1990s onwards is an example of growth in the banking sector that was
accompanied by increasing solvency and liquidity risks the high ratio between loans and deposits
at dutch banks and the associated dependence on shortterm market finance are an illustration
of this certain elements of the dutch tax system such as mortgage interest tax relief are also
examples of growth factors that put pressure on the efficiency of the sector and that carry a
social cost to boot market distortions including implicit subsidies for systemically important
banks that are deemed too big to fail can also lead to a large inefficient banking sector

     another characteristic of the dutch banking landscape is the high market concentration
     with a small number of relatively large dominant institutions based on the market share
     of the five largest banks in consolidated total assets the netherlands has one of the most
     highly concentrated banking sectors in the euro area see chart 22 the dominance of these
     large banks is also evident from their large share in the different domestic banking services
     rabobank ing and abn amro together account for more than threequarters of the
     mortgage commercial lending and savings markets in the netherlands


     failure of individual banks with a large market share could jeopardise the stability of the banking
     service and since banking services in the netherlands are dominated by a small number of
     banks with a large market shares the chance of instability in these services is relatively high
     the european regulations on bank recovery and resolution are designed to reduce these
     distortions and will also affect the structure of the banking sector high concentration can also
     make the sector less efficient where smaller banks enjoy benefits of scale through growth
     large banks may see their service delivery become less efficient as their market share grows
     although competition in a market dominated by large banks is not impossible clearly the level
     of competition would be greater if the degree of concentration were lower banks then have
     a greater incentive to innovate and offer their services at the lowest possible price and the
     distorting effect on competition of implicit subsidies for systemically important banks is also

lower one possible counterweight to these efficiency gains is that banks with a smaller market
share have less access to benefits of scale however this effect appears to be limited because
large banks do not benefit greatly from these types of gains and probably also feel less pressure
to pass them on to their customers


the european banking union has important implications for the structure of the european
banking sector on the one hand it will reduce the problems surrounding systemically
important banks because the playing field for banks and their supervision will be substantially
enlarged while on the other the ongoing integration of european banking market
 in combination with greater transparency and better capitalisation thanks to the aqr 
could lead to a new wave of consolidation among european megabanks that could mean
that banks become even more relevant to the financial system and prove to be too large and
too complex to be resolved in an orderly fashion in light of this dnb wants the topic of a
responsible maximum size for banks in the euro area to be placed on the policy agenda

        box 22  customisation in supervision and regulation

        the regulations rightly set high standards both for existing institutions and for potential
        entrants to the financial sector partly in response to the financial crisis the regulations
        have been tightened and broadened in recent years that was a necessary response to
        developments and a means of ensuring that banks had adequate capital and liquidity

     242 consolidation in a contracting life insurance market
     changes in the market for taxefficient individual assetbuilding products are prompting life
     insurers to evaluate their business models the overcapacity of life insurers puts pressure on
     the resilience of the sector going forward and sales of individual life insurance policies have
     reduced sharply since the introduction of bank saving products in 2008 see chart 23


     it is likely that this contraction is structural in nature which means that life insurers are faced
     with overcapacity resulting in high overheads  principally staff and ict expenses  that are no
     longer in line with premium income the longterm nature of life insurance and the associated
     investment income imply that insurers will be able to carry this overcapacity for a considerable
     time but this is not a sustainable situation in the long term


     fierce competition and the drying up of traditional sources of profit exacerbate the challenges
     for life insurers while taxefficient bank savings are eating into the market share of life
     insurers in individual life insurance there is also growing competition from premium pension
     institutions ppis in the field of taxfriendly collective assetbuilding products the future

administrators to administrate multiple pension schemes is likely to reinforce this trend
although insurance groups can secure a presence in this pensions market through subsidiaries
the contracting market for individual life insurance is unlikely to be large enough to
compensate for this trend for all life insurers the nonlife insurance market is under similar
pressure competition in the private nonlife insurance market is already fierce owing to
the rise of the internet and comparison shopping websites while the commercial segment
is characterised by heavy competition from international specialists the trend for growing
numbers of dedicated life insurance groups to focus on the nonlife market as well is putting
further pressure on margins the ban on life insurers charging commission has also put
pressure on a key traditional distribution channel and is denting the profits of life insurers


contracting premium income and limited growth opportunities mean that cost savings need
to be made in the life insurance sector because the reduction in costs is not keeping pace
with declining premium income cost savings are necessary to enable insurers to continue
meeting their obligations to policyholders in the long term a clear picture of cost structures and
allocations is essential for monitoring whether costsaving programmes are sufficiently effective
for this reason dnb attaches great value to the quality of projections for cost provisions


consolidation can help reduce overhead a merger or acquisition involving two or more
companies brings benefits of scale because the costs of the combined operation will
generally be lower consolidating portfolios can also produce diversification benefits but
this does not provide an overall solution over time life insurers have sold a range of long

64   life products which has made the operational structure of many insurers complex with a
     multiplicity of ict management systems and diminishing knowledge of the products with
     the longest lives because of this backoffice complexity it is not easy by any means for an
     independent insurer to implement rationalisations and cost savings mergers between insurers
     will not in themselves resolve this complexity  it might actually increase  which implies
     that the benefits of scale to be gained from mergers are uncertain and likely to be limited
     uncertainty regarding potential claims involving unitlinked policies makes it difficult to value
     the insurers concerned which could hinder consolidation in the sector dnb would like to see
     a solution to the problem surrounding these insurance products in which the interests of all
     policyholders including those without unitlinked policies are properly weighed


     243 features of a sustainable pension system
     the netherlands has a good pension system by international standards but fundamental
     changes are needed in order to guarantee its sustainability in the future at the same time
     the netherlands has an ageing population shifting employment patterns very low interest
     rates and a reduced willingness of employers to bear risk in order to retain a highquality
     pension system in the long term a number of fundamental changes will have to be made
     while ensuring that the strengths of the current system are retained as the supervisory
     authority dnb is concerned mainly with ensuring transparency for all stakeholders and striking
     a balance between the different groups of pension scheme members dnb also believes it is
     important that the pension system contributes to trust in the robustness of pension funds and
     sustainable economic prosperity in the netherlands dnb identifies the following five features
     of a sustainable pension system


     first of all clear ownership rights contribute to transparency making clear what claim an
     individual has to the pension funds plan assets this requires clear agreements on adjusting
     those claims in the event of financial shocks and changes in average life expectancy so that it
     is clear in advance who bears which risks transparency in the form of clear ownership rights
     will prevent nontransparent changes from being made when absorbing the impact of financial
     shocks it also makes it easier for people to change jobs without affecting their pension accrual
     clear ownership rights also form the basis for communication about pensions that gives
     members a realistic picture of the pension benefits they are likely to receive and the associated
     risks this increases the involvement of members and enables them to arrange for proper
     financial planning


     secondly a balanced sharing of risks increases public support for the pension system and
     means that individual members do not have to save vast amounts of capital to cover the
     possibility of a long life it also enables the investment risks to be borne by members that
     are better able to do so in a sustainable pension system risks are shared in a balanced way
     so that no groups of members are given a structural advantage by the system at the expense
     of others dnb advocates a reappraisal of the sharing of risks with generations that have
     not yet entered the pension system the limited benefits of risksharing with these future

annual report




generations no longer stands up against the administrative and discontinuity risks in which the      65
fruits are consumed immediately and only the burdens are passed on to future generations
another prominent example of a more balanced sharing of risks between generations is the
replacement of the flatrate contributions system in which the pension contribution and
pension accrual is the same percentage of the pensionable salary regardless of the remaining
contribution period a system based on actuarial principles would bring contributions and
the accrual of pension entitlements more into balance and eliminate a major source of
nontransparent and hard to justify redistribution between groups of members it would also
promote the smooth functioning of the labour market because the choice of whether to work
in salaried employment or as selfemployed would no longer be influenced by the pension
system


thirdly customisation will improve the match between the pension system and the
characteristics of different groups of members currently pension accrual starts from
a onesizefitsall approach in the present system the pension ambitions of different
groups of members do not always match their savings and spending patterns pension
ambitions and contributions that gradually reduce in line with income are an initial tool for
differentiating based on the needs of different groups of members high earners are usually
relatively well educated own their own home have considerable financial assets and have
more opportunities on the labour market in later life this justifies giving this group greater
individual responsibility for providing for their retirement low income earners generally have
fewer or no financial assets are often not well educated and have fewer opportunities on the
labour market relatively high pension ambitions would protect their standard of living after
retirement a second opportunity for customisation is differentiation in the ability to bear risk
young people are generally better able to bear financial risks than older people because they
can usually look forward to receiving a substantial income from employment in the future from
which they can save and because they have a long investment horizon the challenge then is
to distribute the risks in the pension system such that young people are able to give priority
to the affordability of their pension accrual and that older people feel that their pensions are
sufficiently secure


fourthly the current pension system is not well geared to the shifting patterns in the labour
market the number of selfemployed persons in the netherlands has increased over recent
years similar to persons on flexible employment contracts such as temporary staff this is a
group who often invest little in a pension against this backdrop it is important to examine
whether the present rules on compulsory pension contributions still have sufficient scope
the starting point should be to set a pension savings requirement that helps to ensure an
adequate standard of living in retirement this will also limit the future risks for taxpayers
the added advantage of a sufficiently broad compulsory system is that it will have less of a
disruptive effect on the choice of whether to work as an employee or to become selfemployed
it would be worth examining whether a distinction needs to be drawn between employees
who are forced to become selfemployed and those who choose to do so voluntarily

66   the method of pension accrual could also take account of the greater need of selfemployed
     persons for liquid financial buffers


     finally the pension system needs to make a greater contribution to macroeconomic stability
     negative financial shocks in the past have often led to higher contributions and curtailment of
     indexation of benefits changes to contributions have had a relatively greater impact because
     they lead to higher labour costs weaken competitiveness in the market and result in lower
     net wages for employees a sustainable system minimises the likelihood that accommodating
     financial shocks drives up labour costs in times of economic weakness and depresses them in
     periods of economic growth


     the challenge for the future appears to lie in combining the best of defined benefit and defined
     contribution plans the public debate on increasing the sustainability of the pension system
     is accompanied by a slow but sure shift from defined benefits to defined contributions

the ambition to maintain the quality of the dutch pension system in the long term does not              67
mean that the importance of retaining the strengths of the current system has been forgotten
examples of those strengths are the group approach the utilisation of benefits of scale the
sharing of risks and the aim to provide lifelong annuitybased pension benefits we need
to avoid these elements being lost in the switch to a more sustainable system at the same
time the reforms offer an opportunity to incorporate strengths that characterise defined
contribution schemes into the dutch pension system these include clear ownership rights
transparent products and greater scope to meet the preferences of members


244 crosssectoral exploration of supervisory regimes
the new supervisory regimes for the banking insurance and pension sectors differ from each
other substantially the development of new legislation and regulations has strengthened
the financial sector in recent years with new regimes for banks basel iiicrd iv insurers
solvency ii and pension funds new financial assessment framework these supervisory
regimes were developed separately from each other against different historical backgrounds
and with different aims basel iiicrd iv was introduced in the wake of the financial crisis in
2008 with the primary purpose of raising both the quality and quantity of capital held in the
global banking sector the development of solvency ii stemmed from the need for a european
riskbased supervisory regime that offers adequate protection to policyholders without directly
seeking to increase the existing capital buffers the new financial assessment framework is
designed to make the existing national framework more resilient to shocks


the differences between the supervisory frameworks stem largely from intrinsic differences
between banks insurers and pension funds each of which play a different role in the economy
and consequently have different business models and risk profiles this creates a different
starting point for elements of the supervisory framework relating to aspects such as balance
sheet valuation confidence level diversification liquidity and capital adequacy requirements
the differences between the supervisory frameworks can create a playing field that is
different in each sector when explained in light of the different characteristics of the sectors
in question this is justifiable from a prudential perspective it is not logical to treat unequal
institutions equally the systemic risk in each sector is different as well which is also a relevant
aspect from a prudential perspective this systemic risk which is a reflection of the level of
interconnectedness with the financial system and replaceability occasionally demands more
robust safeguards and can lead to higher supervisory standards for some types of institutions
within sectors too higher standards are set for systemically important institutions


variations in balance sheet valuation are a prime example of intrinsic differences between
the supervisory frameworks governing banks insurers and pension funds the supervisory
framework for banks does not use market valuation because it is not very easy to determine
a market price for nonmarketable assets in the banking book such as loans using market
valuation to determine the value of the assets of insurers and pension funds is easier because
their assets are principally made up of bonds and equities for which a market price tends to

68   be available the shorter duration of the obligations such as savings deposits also implies
     that market valuation is less urgent for banks than for insurers and pension funds  although
     the latter do in many cases offer their policyholders and members guarantees extending
     over an extremely long period thirdly sharp fluctuations in equity that can stem from market
     valuation can have an undesirable impact on trust in the sector this can have a major impact
     on liquidity positions especially of banks


     another example of a difference in the supervisory frameworks for banks insurers and
     pension funds is the confidence level against which the solvency requirements are calibrated
     the solvency requirements of basel iii solvency ii and the financial assessment framework
     are calculated such that the financial institutions in question hold enough assets to meet
     their obligations with a degree of certainty of 999 995 and 975 respectively over a time
     horizon of one year these differences in confidence level lead to substantial variation in capital
     requirements from a prudential perspective a first justification for the higher confidence level
     for banks is the systemic risk to which they contribute in addition banks are more vulnerable
     because customers can rapidly withdraw their savings a higher capital buffer reduces the risk
     of a run on the bank differences in the nature of the operations and the ultimate beneficiaries
     also justify higher capital requirements for banks and insurers compared with pension funds
     unlike pension funds banks and insurers are generally private enterprises that have been
     financed with loans and riskbearing capital erosion of the buffers can create a perverse
     incentive for shareholders to take more risks in an attempt to repair them holding more own
     funds reduces the risk of institutions ending up in such a situation and being exposed to the
     risks of a costly insolvency finally there are differences in the ability of financial institutions
     to absorb losses stemming from their obligations depositors and policyholders have a claim
     against the business whereas for pension funds reducing the accrued rights of members is an
     option that  albeit as a last resort  can form part of a recovery plan


     there are also differences between the supervisory frameworks in the sectors that mainly
     reflect the fact that these frameworks were developed separately all frameworks are
     the result of negotiations which are heavily shaped by the ideas and interests of direct
     stakeholders in addition basel iii was developed at global level solvency ii at european level
     and the financial assessment framework at national dutch level the priority in these
     negotiations was often not ensuring crosssectoral consistency but strengthening prudential
     supervision dnb will aim to reduce crosssectoral inconsistencies except if this is not possible
     for prudential reasons this prevents arbitrage of regulations and contributes to a level playing
     field  although the adequacy of the framework as a whole should also be taken into account
     individual components of the new supervisory frameworks are often interconnected in all
     manner of ways and repairing differences in one place can lead to distortion somewhere else
     as a result creating a level playing field based on partial analyses is not a viable approach

the financial crisis has made clear that systemically important institutions
cannot fail without compromising financial stability this knowledge has led
to new european legislation and regulations and to the establishment of
the european single resolution mechanism or srm as the second pillar
of the banking union a controlled approach to bank failure or resolution
ensures that a banks critical functions can continue to operate without
government intervention thereby contributing to financial stability the new
regime affects the institutions concerned as well as de nederlandsche bank
dnb which was designated as the national resolution authority on
1 january 2015 this chapter sets out the most relevant developments and
priorities for dnb as the national resolution authority in 2015

section 32 explains the importance and design of the european resolution mechanism as
the second pillar of the banking union the srm promotes a harmonised approach to
resolution in the preparatory phase as well as in the execution phase section 33 addresses
the amendments to national legislation and to the internal organisation that constituted the
basis for dnbs new resolution remit section 34 deals with the importance of adequate
lossabsorption capacity on banking balance sheets for orderly resolution an international
standard is currently being developed for this purpose section 35 sketches the progress made
on the resolution plans for the three large dutch banks and highlights dnbs activities for
the coming year


32   resolution mechanism an essential element of the banking union

the establishment of european banking supervision prompted the need for a harmonised
crossborder approach to failing banks resulting in the launch of the european single
resolution mechanism on 1 january 2015


since 4 november 2014 banking supervision has been a europeanlevel responsibility a similar
instrument for resolution enables problems with banks to be tackled at a european level too
supporting the banking supervision mechanism and breaking through the negative interaction
between governments and banks  one of the main causes of the european debt crisis


the european resolution mechanism became operational on 1 january 2015 like the european
banking supervision system it consists of a network of national resolution authorities headed
by a central decisionmaking body the single resolution board srb the srb executive
board will be installed on 1 march 2015 and consists of a chair a vice chair and four permanent
members the executive board is supplemented in the plenary meeting with the heads of the
national resolution authorities of the participating member states including dnbs executive
director responsible for resoultion together with the relevant national resolution authorities

72   the executive board is responsible for institutionspecific decisions such as determining
     the plans and strategies for resolution actual resolution and the deployment of resolution
     instruments from 1 january 2016 the srb will have a european single resolution fund srf at
     its disposal to which all banks under the srm will contribute


     the scope of the srbs powers will be expanded in phases in 2015 the srb will have the
     power to initiate resolution planning and take measures aimed at improving the resolvability
     of significant institutions under direct ecb supervision from 2016 onwards the srb will be
     able to actually place a failing institution in resolution and apply resolution instruments such as
     amortisation or conversion of liabilities through bailin


     in its first year of operation the srb will focus on operationalising its duties and responsibilities
     in view of its shared responsibility for the implementation of resolution plans as well as the
     actual resolution of banks it is essential for the srb to define clear frameworks of rules and
     regulations within which the resolution authorities may operate the regulatory standards
     and guidelines developed by the european banking authority will serve as the basis for these
     frameworks the srb frameworks should support the preparation resolution planning
     resolvability assessment lossabsorbing capacity requirements as well as the implementation
     of resolution the establishment of these frameworks contributes to a harmonised consistent
     and predictable performance of duties within the srm which will in turn support market
     confidence in the new resolution regime and a level playing field for european banks


     33   dnb as a resolution authority

     pursuant to the srm regulation dnb has been the designated national resolution authority
     since 1 january 2015 dnb will be able to take up its full responsibility in this regard when the
     european bank recovery and resolution directive brrd for recovery and resolution of banks
     and investment firms will have been implemented in full into national legislation this new
     responsibility requires careful embedding in the organisation in order to ensure synergy with
     banking supervision and independence


     an essential precondition for adequate execution of resolution responsibilities is a robust
     regulatory framework the brrd provides for a number of crucial resolution instruments
     and powers and must therefore be translated into national legislation in full and in good
     time as long as this has not been done it will not be possible to set up a national resolution
     fund nor can an institution be placed in resolution should the need arise until that time
     the supervisory authority and the minister may exercise their powers pursuant to the
     intervention act


     dnbs designation as the national resolution authority requires considerable organisational
     adjustments dnb now has a dedicated resolution division with its own duties staff and
     budget with one of dnbs governing board members being responsible for resolution authority

jaarverslag




operations in order to ensure independence this board member may not at the same time be             73
responsible for monetary policy financial stability or banking supervision


an internal resolution board has now kicked off chaired by the director for resolution and
including representatives from the divisions that are relevant to resolution such as banking
supervision and financial stability the board will discuss decisions regarding resolution
planning removing impediments to resolvability and actual resolution cases it will also discuss
subjects such as internal and external upscaling and the operationalisation of resolution
instruments the governing board holds overall responsibility as with all dnbs duties


a national resolution fund will need to be set up in 2015 that will fund an institutions resolution
where needed using the fees it charges to banks and a limited number of investment firms
covered by the brrd from 1 january 2016 onwards it will pass on fees charged to banks to the
european single resolution fund fees charged to investment firms will continue to be used for
the national resolution fund


34 lossabsorbing capacity important for the resolvability of
systemic banks

to ensure orderly resolution and protect the treasury it is essential that the systemically
important banks in particular have adequate lossabsorption capacity banks must therefore
manage their balance sheets to ensure that such capacity is available in the event of resolution
sufficient lossabsorbing capacity will have to ensure the credibility of shareholders and
creditors picking up the bill if a bank fails for example by using the bailin instrument


in november 2014 the financial stability board fsb proposed requirements with the aim of
raising the total loss absorbing capacity tlac of global systemic banks these requirements
raise the current minimum capital requirements under basel iii excluding buffers to a
minimum of between 16 and 20 of riskweighted assets on the understanding that other
instruments such as subordinated debt may also be included figure 1 similar to the
basel iii capital requirements the fsb proposals comprise an unweighted minimum requirement
of at least 6 of a banks total assets the main purpose of lossabsorbing capacity is
recapitalisation of the core activities of a bank during resolution to enable these activities
to continue without the tlac requirements chances are that systemic banks will have
inadequate lossabsorbing capacity at the moment of resolution forcing the state to deploy
public resources the final tlac requirements are due for adoption in late 2015 following a
public consultation round and the fsbs quantitative impact assessment


the tlac requirements are related to the brrd minimum requirement for own funds and
eligible liabilities mrel and provide for a specific and effective implementation of the
european requirement dnb is in favour of the tlac proposals and would like to see that the
european mrel requirement is aligned with the final tlac requirement it is essential that

74   banks hold sufficient mrel resources to be eligible for support from the resolution fund if
     required the brrd states that banks are eligible for support from the fund only after
     bailin of 8 of their total assets the loss absorbing capacity requirements are expected to
     be introduced gradually in order to limit the consequences for lending

     35 well begun is half done resolution planning

     adequate resolution planning ensures that both the institution and the resolution authority
     are wellprepared for unexpected problems in 2014 dnb presented the resolution strategy
     and an initial operational resolution plan for the three largest dutch banks in 2015 the focus
     will be on finalising the resolvability assessment jointly determining how banks should remove
     impediments to resolution and defining the mrel resources resolution planning for the other
     banks will also start in 2015


     the aim of resolution is to ensure that critical activities are continued without material risks
     to the taxpayer and financial stability shareholders and unsecured creditors must share in
     the losses adequate preparation is essential to achieving this aim the resolution authority
     determines a resolution strategy for this purpose specifying how and where the authority
     will intervene and works out a plan to implement this strategy needless to say the internal
     organisation and processes of the resolution authority must also be in order


     in 2014 dnb presented the resolution strategy and an initial operational resolution plan for
     the three largest dutch banks these plans are based on information from and consultations
     with the institutions about their financial legal operational and organisational structure
     and interdependencies in addition the process has helped dnb in identifying the structural
     conditions that institutions have to meet in order to be able to implement the resolution
     strategy such as improving management information systems ensuring continuity of it and
     payment systems drafting resolution proof contracts and having sufficient loss absorbing

jaarverslag




capacity for bailin dnb has meanwhile started its resolvability assessment of the largest          75
banks on the basis of these preconditions


this assessment is due to be completed in 2015 after which dnb will share its initial operational
resolution plan with the institutions concerned as soon as the tlac and mrel requirements
have been finalised a minimum level of lossabsorbing capacity will be determined
the institutions are expected to draw up a transition plan in 2015 in order to remove the
impediments identified in the operational resolution plan as soon as possible these activities
are undertaken in close collaboration and alignment with the srb


dnb will determine if a resolution plan is also required for the nonsignificant institutions
for the most important midsized banks dnb will set out a process for drawing up the
resolution strategy and the resolution plan for the other midsized and smaller banks and
relevant investment firms dnb will develop a proportional resolution planning framework

41   introduction                                                                                    79


ensuring secure reliable and efficient payment systems is one of dnbs main
objectives reliability and security of such systems have to be earned every
single time more particularly as innovations are constantly being introduced
continuity of payment and settlement systems is imperative while their
infrastructures are being updated

in the netherlands we demand secure reliable and efficient payment systems  and rightly
so as money and payments are so basic to the economy that we cannot afford to have the
payment infrastructure break down technical system failures or external factors such as
cyberattacks can undermine the robustness of the infrastructure and so jeopardise financial
stability section 42 of this report sets out the measures implemented by dnb government
and other regulators both at home and abroad to guarantee continuity of payments as much
as possible section 43 discusses innovations in retail payments such as mobile payments
such innovations apart from reflecting social trends often also lead to greater efficiency
in payments systems with the introduction of the single euro payments area sepa
europewide innovations are preferred over domestic solutions section 44 discusses the use
of cash cash retains a meaningful position despite the gradual shift towards electronic
payments cash should remain generally accepted and cash dispensing machines atms
should continue to be widely available section 45 discusses the reforms of the international
overthecounter otc derivatives markets these market infrastructure innovations were
introduced in response to the 2008 financial crisis in order to mitigate the systemic risks
involved in derivatives transactions


in short payment infrastructures must continue to operate at all times even when specific
components are being updated and enhanced for payment and settlement systems the
maxim business as usual must also apply during alterations


42 security and reliability of payments

payments and settlement systems are becoming increasingly interconnected and complex cyber
threats pose a structural risk to their security and reliability and demand a rigorous approach


421 cyberthreats
banking systems financial markets and payment infrastructures are increasingly interconnected
particularly on the back of everwider application of information and communication technology
ict however it is precisely because of this interconnectedness that cyber attacks can do
substantial harm to the financial sector systemic risks may emerge if such an attack targets
payments and settlement at and between financial institutions and market infrastructures
cyber attacks are growing increasingly sophisticated and can damage the availability
reliability and integrity of ict systems in the financial sector  with advanced persistent threats

80   apts posing the biggest danger in apts ict systems are being infiltrated and the attack
     mode is adjusted to the defence mechanisms in place at the target thus detection is avoided
     and havoc can be wreaked for months or even years the diversity of cyber attackers and their
     motives is also increasing hacktivists for one typically look to disrupt selected activities
     and may have a political message to deliver other cyber criminals are driven by personal gain
     while foreign security services may try to retrieve information or disable ict systems


     the financial sector has launched concerted efforts across the world in order to bolster resilience
     against cyberthreats a working group of the basel committee on payments and market
     infrastructures chaired by dnb has analysed cyberthreats to financial market infrastructures
     and is advocating an integrated approach in which all players in the payment or settlement
     industry join forces its recommendations cover governance and policies security measures
     and potential scenarios in addition to ict measures cyber resilience warrants attention at
     the highest executive levels and requires internal and external communications attention to
     processes and employee awareness the working group has recommended a wide range of
     security measures particularly in the ict arena and also suggested that institutions set up their
     systems to enable a quick recovery to normal operations if an attack succeeds even if on a
     smaller scale at first


     422 working towards safety and robustness
     to maintain robust payment infrastructures financial institutions must adequately manage
     their operational and security risks banks have reduced fraudrelated losses in retail payments
     with a range of measures since 2012 losses totalled eur 95 million in the first half of 2014
     banks reported fewer cases of both internet banking fraud eg phishing and payment fraud
     eg skimming thanks to such measures as the introduction of emv chip cards preventive
     blocking of the use of debit cards outside europe and enhanced fraud detection systems
     despite these measures the threat of fraud remains high in online banking


     to maintain robust payment infrastructures dnb wants banks to commit to reducing the
     effects of the kinds of disruptions and attacks they fell prey to in april of 2013 banks have now
     taken measures to better ward off distributed denial of service ddos attacks they are also
     disentangling the infrastructures for ideal internet banking and mobile banking the objective
     is that these should operate independently as much as possible and that any failures will not
     take down the entire electronic payment system while information security at dutch banks
     has improved steadily since 2010 dnb will further tighten its prudential requirements on ict
     risk management in 2015 with a view to cyberthreats in addition we are investigating the
     payments chains on a range of payment products and their vulnerabilities to find out if further
     measures are needed


     meanwhile the dutch legislator is also looking at ways of enhancing the security and
     availability of payment systems and has expanded the legal requirements regarding controlled
     and ethical operational management with effect from 1 january 2015 these requirements as

annual report




imposed on banks settlement firms and electronic money and payment institutions now also             81
regard the smooth operation of the payment system dnb will translate these requirements
into rules and standards for the availability and security of payment systems based on the 2012
international principles for financial market infrastructures pfmi supplemented if necessary
by rules provided by the european banking authority eba and the european forum for the
security of retail payments in 2014 this ecbcreated forum was turned into a joint ecbeba
platform that brings together central banks in their capacity as overseers of the payment
systems and prudential supervisors


despite the plethora of measures taken we cannot entirely rule out payment failures or cyber
incidents as payment chains are complex and it is virtually impossible to avoid technical failures
in all links of the chain at all times parties with malicious intent can abuse software and
hardware vulnerabilities to attack financial institutions prevention of cyber attacks and failures
as well as rapid recovery measures go hand in hand the reliability and security of payment
systems have to be earned every single time


43	sepa up and running
     innovations and the future of european payments

2014 saw the launch of the single european payments area sepa which encourages
competition and lays the foundation for innovations contributing to the smooth operation of
the payment system


431 sepa foundation for innovation
1 august 2014 was an important date in the history of the single european payments
area as it saw the completion of the migration to international bank account numbers
ibans and common sepa standards for credit transfers and direct debits in the euro area
this harmonisation of the main noncash payment methods has created the conditions for
a competitive and innovative european payments market sepas explicit purpose sepa
should make it easier for payment service providers such as banks and payment processors to
provide their services internationally as consumers and companies are no longer constrained
by national borders when choosing one or more providers the idea is that sepa will promote
competition in the market for payment services enable providers to leverage economies of
scale and cost benefits and lead to greater innovation from this perspective the completion
of the sepa migration is only the beginning of the single payments market to enhance sepas
development with input from providers and users of payment services the ecb created the
euro retail payments board erpb at the end of 2013


432 innovations social needs and risks
payment innovations are driven by the changing needs of consumers and businesses
mobile payments are becoming increasingly important as mobile devices claim a bigger role
in our daily lives meanwhile banks in the netherlands offer mobile banking apps for remote

82   payments following a successful contactless payment pilot project in leiden in 2013 one of the
     major dutch banks has been offering the ewallet since the beginning of 2015 the electronic wallet
     contains debit card data and other information to make payments in addition one of the countrys
     mobile telephone providers has introduced a mobile payments product contactless payment by
     debit card has also gained traction since its rollout at the start of 2014 in december 2014 the
     number of transactions stood at over 2 million four times as much as in july contactless payment
     is expected to gain rapid acceptance as over the next two years major retailers are replacing their
     current terminals by equipment that will accept contactless payments smaller companies will
     probably wait to do so until their terminals certification expires


     while mobile phones can also be used for persontoperson payments this would still seem to
     be a poor alternative for cash in the netherlands granted a mobile banking app supports the
     initiation of payments onthespot but this is more complicated than simply paying in cash
     in addition the payment does not show up immediately in the recipients account if they happen
     to bank with another bank a number of other european countries including sweden the
     united kingdom and italy are already facilitating virtually realtime persontoperson payment
     methods digitisation makes these types of payment more efficient while they also reflect
     broader trends in society such as the growth of ecommerce and online activity in general


     every new and more efficient payment product also requires a close assessment of its risks
     new products may still have security weaknesses that fraudsters can leverage for instance
     via malware malicious software used to infiltrate users computers or via phishing payment
     instruments offering high levels of anonymity such as virtual currencies are particularly
     vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing if necessary dnb will advise users of
     these risks and hold providers accountable both the ecb and the eba are monitoring the risks
     with the latter also providing guidance on the security of retail payments


     433 early adoption or waitandsee innovation in the netherlands or europe
     sepa facilitates europewide innovation but designing crossborder products is not quite
     as easy in practice it is being complicated by the complexity of european decisionmaking
     processes and infrastructures besides countries are displaying different payment method
     preferences so there is no homogeneous payments market making it hard to achieve
     economies of scale on occasion similar solutions are designed in different countries but with
     technical differences preventing interoperability for example countries have yet to agree on a
     european electronic direct debit mandate emandate to simplify the issuance and registration
     of mandates in the netherlands it should become possible in 2015 to issue an electronic
     mandate in a technically and legally sound manner


     here a dilemma arises when innovations bring clear social advantages providers should not
     allow themselves to be slowed down by lack of progress in europe at the same time a single
     european payments market fragmented by innovations in individual countries is not the way
     to go as it fails to lock in the advantages of sepa a single european payments area supporting

annual report




european payment solutions is in the general interest but not everyone is aware of this yet                         83
the transition to sepa was merely a beginning it is time to start reaping the rewards of the
migration efforts
												
44 cash use and availability

while cash remains the most common method to pay at the counter its use is dropping steadily
cash dispensers are readily available in the netherlands although gaps have opened up in some
rural areas  which the banks will need to address together


441 cash and debit card transactions
the use of cash is declining slowly in 2014 cash point and bank counter withdrawals fell by
over eur 2 billion to eur 49 billion a eur 9 billion drop from 2010 although cash is still the
most frequently used payment instrument in pointofsale pos payments its share in the
total number of these payments has declined over the past years see table 41 this trend is
expected to continue in the 20142018 pin agreement retailers and banks have committed
themselves to reducing the proportion of cash payments further to 40 in favour of debit card
transactions


table 41 debit card transactions are increasing but cash remains important

                                                              2010         2011   2012          2013         2014

note figures relating to cash transactions are estimates other payment
instruments include the electronic purse and the credit card

84   cash however continues to play a key role and this is not only because with cash you
     immediately round off a payment transaction finality the existence of various payment
     instruments is also relevant to prevent possible social unrest if the electronic payment channel
     is temporarily out of order then cash can serve as an alternative payment instrument in this
     light it is in the interest of society that cash remains readily available to settle payments
     that retailers continue to have easy access to depositing facilities and that consumers can keep
     withdrawing cash amounts easily


     in 2014 dnb detected more counterfeit euro notes see table 42 elsewhere in europe
     the number of counterfeit banknotes is also rising due to the operations of international
     criminal organisations

     442 access to cash dispensers atms
     in 2014 access to atms was in the news residents of several rural areas complained about
     the disappearance of local atms research by the national forum on the payment system
     however showed that 9959 of the population lives within five kilometres of a bank atm
     virtually unchanged from the 2013 number of 9965 this does not detract from the fact that
     easy access to atms everywhere is desirable from a social point of view a generic approach
     to achieve this is as yet unwarranted as access is still easy on the whole in addition the banks
     are prepared to address bottlenecks this offers the opportunity for tailormade solutions as
     having an atm within five kilometres does not automatically mean that it is within easy reach
     alternative solutions such as cashback at local shops or installing nonbank atms may also
     be explored banks have now also obtained approval from the authority for consumers 
     markets for a pilot project in the southwest of the country to confer about installing atms
     together in such a way that they are easily accessible throughout the area


     as the use of cash declines peer consultation among banks may provide the opportunity to
     rationalise the atm network gradually while maintaining national coverage costs associated
     with the use of cash may be managed in this way and an excessive drop in the number of atms
     may be avoided it would not be acceptable if consumers were no longer able to pay in cash

annual report




due to poor access to atms on dnbs initiative the national forum on the payment system                                                                85
will examine this year how easy access to cash may be ensured in the longer term


45 reform in the international otc derivatives markets

derivatives markets are being reformed in order to safeguard financial stability all financial
institutions using derivatives are required to adjust their risk management processes


451 content and purpose of the reforms
otc derivatives are financial instruments that market participants use to hedge risks or to
enter into new risks since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008 it has become clear that
many market participants had taken insufficient account of the potential obligations associated
with derivatives the international otc derivatives markets also lacked transparency due to
the plethora of bilateral contractual relationships


prompted by the crisis the g20 government leaders in september 2009 initiated international
market reforms the objectives of these reforms are curbing system risks increasing transparency
and combating market abuse the main change is that standard contracts will now be settled
through central counterparties ccps see figure 41 this reduces the likelihood of the
default of one market participant destabilising the whole financial system for two reasons
firstly a ccp reduces the current positions of its members by netting mutual claims and
liabilities multilateral netting and secondly ccps guarantee transactions and can take over
liabilities from a counterparty if necessary in exchange they require security in the form of
collateral stricter collateral and capital demands will also apply to transactions not settled
through ccps in order to increase market transparency and counter market abuse the g20

settlement through ccps reduces counterparty risks and increases transparency

note settlement by means of a ccp provides financial market participants with one and the same solid counterparty
      only banks have direct access to a ccp other parties can get access through a bank general clearing member

86   agreed that standard contracts will be traded though trade platforms and all contracts must
     be registered in trade repositories in europe the g20 agreements have been incorporated in
     the european market infrastructure regulation and the capital requirements directive and
     regulation these reforms will capture systemic risks which is to be welcomed but they will
     also create new risks for the financial sector that demand complementary measures


     452 new risks
     first of all due to the reforms liquidity risks increase market participants need a structurally
     higher amount of suitable collateral in particular cash and highgrade government paper
     although this provides for better management of counterparty risks a larger proportion of
     liquid assets is encumbered and no longer available for other purposes in times of stress
     the need for collateral may also increase rapidly if the market value of contracts changes
     sharply market participants may be ordered by a ccp or a general clearing member gcm
     to provide additional collateral immediately this may have considerable effects for end users
     with onesided derivatives portfolios liquidity risks also occur in bilateral transactions that will
     be subjected to the stricter collateral requirements an additional problem is that the value of
     collateral may drop in times of stress thereby fuelling market risks


     the second category of risks induced by these reforms is that of concentration risks this is
     first of all due to the fact that a substantial proportion of the otc derivatives transactions
     will be settled by a small number of ccps a second source of increased risk is that endusers
      who do not have direct access to central settlement  use gcms as economies of scale are
     at play in derivatives settlement globally there is only a limited number of gcms mostly large
     international banks here too risks coalesce as gcms guarantee the exposures of their
     customers are affiliated with several ccps and contribute to the latters guarantee funds
     they may form a contagion channel for a financial shock to prevent this from happening
     gcms must be able to bear large losses the market for bilateral transactions that are not
     settled centrally will also have a small number of large active counterparties high market
     concentration limits the options and sometimes market entry for certain parties end users
     with large derivatives portfolios such as dutch pension funds will not be able to do business
     with a single gcm but are required to split up the clearing of their derivatives portfolio
     small parties will find it hard to obtain access if the gcm considers their small portfolios not
     sufficiently profitable owing to the scale of the operation of ccps and gcms


     453 effects on the dutch financial sector
     dutch financial institutions have large derivatives portfolios mid2014 the gross market
     value of the derivatives contracts of banks pension funds and insurance companies taken
     together came to eur 305 billion on the assets side and eur 286 billion on the liabilities side
     of their balance sheets the reforms will consequently have substantial liquidity effects for
     these market players in particular for pension funds and to a lesser extent for life insurance
     companies in view of the nature of their business the derivatives positions are onesided
     which limits the options for netting and makes for high collateral requirements banks will not

annual report




suffer that quickly from a shortage of collateral provided they prepare themselves adequately       87
due to the character of their business banks hold more liquid assets and if necessary they can
appeal to the central bank many banks say that they are busy building their liquidity buffers
they are also adjusting their collateral management systems in order to have better insight
into their necessary and available collateral the biggest risk for banks and for insurers is the
possibility that the ccps or gcms tighten their collateral requirements suddenly


454 risk management is important
individual market participants using derivatives are required to maintain liquidity buffers and
to perform stress tests on these buffers when assessing their liquidity requirements banks
must take account of their contingent liabilities such as extra contributions to the ccp arising
from their status of clearing member pension funds and insurers ought to perform regular
liquidity stress tests in order to assess what effect the new collateral requirements have in
stress scenarios it is also recommendable to curb the procyclicity of collateral requirements
on dnbs initiative a working group of the european systemic risk board will explore the
options for doing this if ccps and gcms use conservative margin requirements they will
also remain robust during stress periods while liquidity risks for other market participants
are limited ccps need recovery and resolution plans in order to tackle concentration risks
overseers will review their recovery plans and compile resolution plans this requires
international coordination between supervisors and overseers to ensure the robustness of the
otc derivatives infrastructure and thereby safeguard financial stability

this chapter discusses the main results achieved in 2014 it summarises the achievements with
regard to dnbs core tasks corporate social responsibility csr financial results and internal
operational management


sustainability is one of the key principles underlying dnbs performance of its tasks as is
evident from its mission dnb seeks to safeguard financial stability and thus contributes to
sustainable prosperity in the netherlands this refers to longterm sustainable prosperity
based on sustainable economic social and environmental factors in addition to this mission
dnbs strategy comprises ten longterm ambitions


1    dnb is an influential bank in the european system of central banks escb
2    dnb is a leading institution in the area of financial stability
3    dnb stands for efficient and robust payment and securities chains
4    dnbs supervision sets a benchmark and is authoritative
5    dnb influences financial and economic policy in its envisaged direction
6	dnb makes full use of the synergy stemming from its combined role of central bank and
      supervisor
7    dnb hires only the best people for all positions
8	dnb has a modern information system and produces practically viable statistics to
      internal and external users
9    dnb contributes to trust in the financial system through consistent communications
10   dnb has an effective governance model


dnb seeks to perform its core tasks as effectively and efficiently as possible and to integrate
and embed sustainability into the performance of its tasks and its operational management
the aspect of sustainability is therefore discussed on various pages of this annual report




52 results achieved in dnbs core tasks

521 financial stability
dnb is responsible for overseeing financial stability in the netherlands  an essential
precondition for balanced economic development together with price stability see section 523
on monetary tasks financial stability forms the basis on which businesses and households
take their shortterm and longterm economic decisions imbalanced developments such as
boombust cycles in the financial sector can hamper this decisionmaking and may result
in substantial economic and financial damage to society at large moreover such cycles
may encourage nonsustainable deployment of resources examples include real estate and
infrastructure projects that were started on the basis of cheap funding and overly optimistic
expectations and ending up in vacant business property and unfinished holiday parks

100   on 1 january 2014 various amendments to the bank act bankwet and the financial
      supervision act wet op het financieel toezicht came into effect assigning dnb with the
      formal duty of promoting the stability of the financial system with the capital requirements
      regulation crr and the capital requirements directive crd iv entering into force
      dnb now has the macroprudential instruments at its disposal to fulfil this task with respect
      to banks crd iv for example offers the scope of increasing sectoral risk weightings using a
      countercyclical capital buffer and imposing higher capital buffers on systemically important
      banks in 2014 dnb imposed additional capital requirements of 3 of riskweighted assets
      on ing bank rabobank and abn amro bank and 1 on sns bank the higher buffer
      requirements allows these banks  with the crucial role that they play in the financial
      system  to better absorb unexpected losses banks have been allowed to build up these
      buffers gradually between 2016 and 2019 starting in 2016 dnb will determine the size of the
      countercyclical capital buffer ccb on a quarterly basis this extra capital buffer requirement
      may be activated during periods of excessive credit growth which are often indicators of a
      looming financial crisis in anticipation of the implementation of the ccb dnb now indicates
      in its biannual overview of financial stability ofs whether it would be appropriate to activate
      this instrument dnb saw no reason for activation in 2014 as credit growth in the netherlands
      remained modest


      the ofs outlines risks that affect groups of institutions or entire sectors that could destabilise
      the dutch financial system and that may eventually disrupt the economy in 2014 the ofs
      focused in particular on low interest rates and the subsequent search for yields bubble
      creation in the financial markets liquidity and concentration risks on the derivatives markets
      the dutch mortgage portfolio the downward pressure on bank yields and cyberthreats
      in addition to more general external risks such as a renewed outbreak of the european debt
      crisis geopolitical tensions in the middle east ukraine and russia and the phasing out of the
      accommodating monetary policy in the united states based on the risk analysis included
      in the ofs operational supervision determines whether mitigating actions at individual
      institutions are required macromicro link


      the main risks to financial stability are also discussed in the financial stability committee fsc
      this committee comprises dnb the authority for the financial markets afm and the
      ministry of finance and is headed by the president of dnb in 2014 the fsc convened twice
      to discuss the role of standards for mortgage finance to promote a stable housing market
      more specifically the pros and cons of lowering the loantovalue ltv limit for mortgage
      loans after 2018 were discussed the effects and risks relating to such a measure are currently
      being studied the fsc also endorsed the dutch efforts to impose an internationally harmonised
      minimum standard for the loss absorption capacity of banks in resolution this standard
      ensures that bailin can be implemented effectively and adequately thereby minimising
      the chance that banks need to be saved with public funds in the future the committee
      also discussed the position of the dutch life insurance sector observing that the sectors
      traditional business model is under pressure from factors such as low interest rates and

annual report




falling premium income in addition the sector is still dealing with the unitlinked insurance     101
policy issue resolving the problems in the life insurance sector requires a combination of
measures to be taken by the sector including the development of sustainable business models
finally the committee found that most dutch major banks followed its recommendation
that they should improve the risk information provided in their annual reports this will allow
investors to make more balanced risk assessments


on an international level dnb advocated a sound design of macroprudential policy for instance
on the european systemic risk board esrb chaired by dnb the esrbs instruments working
group iwg has worked on operationalising objectives and instruments in this context
the resulting report was published early in 2014 and led to the esrbs recommendation to
national governments to provide their macroprudential authorities with sufficient instruments
the macroprudential authorities of various eu countries reported to the esrb that they
took a total of 95 macroprudential measures in 2014 the countries of the single supervisory
mechanism ssm coordinate their macroprudential measures even more closely in particular
through the ecbs financial stability committee fsc due to the diverging financial cycles
and structural risks in the various member states macroprudential policy is a national task
however the ecb has the power to tighten national measures if necessary dnb is represented
on the ecbs financial stability committee


dnb is responsible for implementing the deposit guarantee scheme dgs which guarantees
savings deposits up to eur 100000 per account holder per bank dgs regulations have been
harmonised within the european union in 2014 agreements were made at the european level
regarding a revision of the dgs directive which is to enter into effect by mid2015 and require
the dutch deposit guarantee scheme to convert to exante funding the revised directive
will offer more comprehensive coverage the maximum payment period will be shortened and
communication about the dgs to deposit holders will be improved instead of paying deposit
holders the dgs could also contribute to a banks resolution by enabling a takeover by another
bank payments to deposit holders may no longer be necessary this is subject to the condition
that this should involve lower net costs for the dgs dnb is advising the ministry of finance in
the transposition of the directive into dutch legislation


522 resolution
during the financial crisis european governments were forced to bail out a large number of
banks with public funds many banks were too closely interconnected within the financial
system and were too important for the real economy to allow them to fail to prevent this from
happening again in the future various measures have been taken such as the development
of the european bank recovery and resolution directive brrd and the establishment of
the single resolution mechanism srm this mechanism comprises the european single
resolution board and the national resolution authorities of the euro area including dnb
together these authorities have the power to make preparations for a banks resolution
resolution planning and to intervene if a bank threatens to fail resolution means that a bank

102   is stabilised and restructured in a controlled manner without material risks to financial stability
      and the taxpayer


      in 2014 the minister of finance and dnb jointly determined the resolution strategy for ing bank
      rabobank and abn amro bank which outlines the resolution planning for these banks
      the strategy comprises an approach at group level in the course of 2014 theses strategies were
      translated into operational plans including an assessment of the banks resolvability


      resolution legislation has been primarily developed in a european context dnb advised
      the ministry of finance and contributed to the positioning of the ecb pursuant to the
      srm regulation the minister of finance designated dnb with effect from 1 january 2015
      as the national resolution authority for banks and a number of investment firms in the
      autumn of 2014 the necessary preparations were made including amendments to dnbs
      governance and the establishment of a new resolution division see also section 54 in 2015
      the implementation of the brrd will be a key point of focus as this directive sets out the
      resolution powers and instruments that dnb needs to perform its resolution duties effectively


      the european single resolution board srb formally took up its task on 1 january 2015 dnbs
      executive director responsible for resoultion occupies a seat on this board the srb focuses on
      the significant banks that are under direct supervision of the ecb and it will be authorised to
      effectuate the resolution of problem banks as from january 2016 it will have a resolution fund
      at its disposal for this purpose financed by the banks the total size of this resolution fund will
      eventually amount to eur 55 billion the netherlands will contribute around eur 45 billion to
      the fund
      through the financial stability board dnb contributed to the development of regulations
      with respect to the lossabsorbing capacity of global systemic banks the total lossabsorbing
      capacity tlac requirements ensure that the costs of bank failure can be shifted credibly and
      effectively to the shareholders and creditors the tlac requirements also lead to sufficient own
      funds being available in resolution to ensure continuation of a banks core activities such as
      savings and lending


      523 monetary tasks
      as a member of the eurosystem dnb contributes to the development and implementation of
      monetary policy measures monetary policy is aimed at price stability over the medium term
      which is an important precondition for businesses and households to invest in their future
      with certainty and confidence in this way monetary policy contributes to the retention of
      economic and human capital and hence to current and future prosperity in the netherlands
      and the euro area


      in 2014 new monetary measures were decided on in view of the low inflation outlook for the
      euro area the policy interest rate was lowered in june and september to 005 to enhance
      the effectiveness of this measure the interest rate on the deposit facility was also reduced

annual report




to 02 the negative deposit rate means that banks are required to pay for the deposits they    103
hold with the ecb in addition two unconventional monetary measures were taken aimed at
supporting monetary transmission and lending operations the first comprises a series of
targeted longerterm refinancing operations tltros running until september 2018 this will
give banks temporary access to cheap longerterm central bank funding the tltros provide
an extra incentive for banks to increase their lending to the real economy as for all banks the
size of the available funds was made dependent on the number of outstanding and new loans
to the private sector and nonfinancial organisations in particular the second unconventional
measure comprises the purchase programmes for various types of assets in the euro area
in october 2014 the eurosystem central banks started purchasing covered bonds as part of
a new cbpp3 asset purchase programme set up especially for this purpose in november the
ecb launched a purchase programme for assetbacked securities abspp in january 2015 it
was decided to expand the programme to include bonds issued by european governments and
european institutions from march 2015 through to september 2016 the combined monthly
asset purchases of public and private sector bonds will amount to eur 60 billion
the low inflation outlook for the short term necessitates an accommodating monetary policy
however the potentially undesirable side effects of the current accommodating monetary
policy stance are a growing dilemma in the decisionmaking process continued low interest
rates and substantial unconventional liquidity support may reduce incentives for governments
and the private sector to implement structural reforms and pursue sound financial management
moreover an accommodating monetary policy may encourage excessive riskseeking
behaviour in investors the search for higher yields may go hand in hand with the creation of
bubbles in certain market segments


an accommodating monetary policy supports economic growth in the euro area but it is up
to the governments to find sustainable solutions to the economic problems in the euro area
such as measures to boost the growth potential proper alignment of monetary policy with
other policy areas both in the netherlands and at european level underlines the importance
of transparency about monetary policies towards stakeholders as well as the general
public in order to promote a better understanding of the decisionmaking process with
respect to monetary measures the ecbs governing council decided in 2014 to publish the
minutes of its meetings starting in 2015 dnb highlighted the social effects and dilemmas
underlying monetary measures in 2014 in its dnbulletins speeches and external presentations
dnb president klaas knot took part in a lower house hearing on the risk of deflation in
the euro area and in a public discussion with the standing finance committee about the
monetary decisions taken in june 2014 last but not least dnb kept the government informed
of monetary policy pursued for example in the regular meetings between dnb president
klaas knot and the minister of finance

104   advisory role in economic policies
      in addition to its monetary duties dnb also has an advisory role in particular with respect
      to economic policy discussions dnb seeks to deploy its knowledge to promote balanced
      economic development and foster prosperity in the netherlands in the long term a balanced
      economic development contributes to public confidence in the financial sector the euro
      and in dnb as a central bank and supervisor


      in 2014 dnb contributed to four economic policy areas a position paper was drafted in the
      context of the national pension dialogue published in early 2015 discussing five important
      features of a sustainable pension system clear ownership rights balanced risksharing
      more customisation contribution to economic stability and a broader pension saving
      obligation dnbs occasional study entitled bank lending and capital provided guidance in
      the public debate on potential bottlenecks in lending it explained how the dutch banks may
      combine the required and desired capital strengthening over the next few years with lending
      operations that meet the needs of businesses and households in the light of the projected
      economic growth dnb acknowledges the problems experienced mainly by smaller businesses
      in gaining access to bank loans which is also evident from the latest dnb statistics on
      lending to the sme sector within the social and economic council of the netherlands ser
      dnb contributed actively to a report providing solutions for expanding and strengthening the
      funding market for the sme sector in the medium term dnbs occasional study entitled
      wage development considered sets out the theory and practice of the wage formation
      process and includes our advice to continue the policy of responsible wage development to
      prevent unemployment from rising further differentiated wage development with wage
      growth in sectors with financial headroom may contribute to the desired improvement
      of spending power finally dnb contributed to the european discussion on the dutch
      involvement in imbalances in the euro area with its occasional study getting to the bottom
      of the dutch savings surplus the analysis revealed that large multinationals substantial
      pension assets and extended household balance sheets are all having a major statistical impact
      on dutch savings such an exceptional financial and economic structure warrants care in the
      interpretation of the countrys current account balance


      dnbs economic developments and outlook shows that domestic dynamics are steadily
      growing stronger domestic expenditure will gradually take over from exports as the main
      driver behind economic growth allowing the dutch economy to grow under its own steam
      again in its june outlook dnb sketched a scenario explaining how a possible escalation of the
      unrest in ukraine could pressurise the recovery of the dutch economy the december outlook
      on the other hand contained a more positive scenario setting out how higher public and
      private investments in europe and in germany in particular may boost economic growth in
      the netherlands in 2015 and 2016


      with a view to promoting its policy advice dnb actively engaged in dialogue with its
      stakeholders by giving presentations organising expert meetings and asking for written

annual report




responses to its draft reports dnbs policy advice and its analyses have found their way to        105
national and international policy documents such as letters to parliament and reports of the
netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis cpb the social and economic council
of the netherlands ser the european commission and the international monetary fund
dnbulletins which summarise dnbs policy advice for the general public received ample
coverage in newspapers on television and in social media


research
dnb can rely on the results of its own research and on the knowledge and skills acquired
during the research process to deliver highquality contributions to monetary policy
decisionmaking economic policy advice and the performance of its other duties in order
to safeguard the quality of its research capacity and to make the most of the synergy with
its core tasks dnbs research effort is evaluated on a regular basis by internal stakeholders
and external experts in 2014 the research activities for 20102014 were evaluated externally
the evaluation report states that the quality of research is high by international standards
and has increased since 2010 a continuous inflow of young talented researchers is essential in
order to maintain this positive development however the report also mentions possibilities for
further strengthening the synergy between research and policy for example by promoting the
mobility of researchers within dnb
in 2014 the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy in an environment of virtually
zero policy rates was studied in the context of preparing monetary policy another subject of
study was the impact of previous announcements of ecb balance sheet expansions on inflation
expectations a third example of its research is a dnb study asserting that the stimulating
effect of expansionary monetary policy declines over time and that a continued period of low
real interest rates can be detrimental to the economys growth potential the study provides
a better understanding of the dilemma of potentially unwanted side effects of the current
accommodating monetary policy dnbs 17th annual research conference also contributed to
knowledge generation about current topics in communications concerning conventional and
unconventional monetary policy


dnb uses its internal studies as a basis for its economic policy advice for example the dnb
household survey provided valuable input for dnbs advice on the design of a sustainable
pension system these unique panel data accurately reflect the dutch population and
allow for investigation of psychological as well as economic aspects of financial behaviour
the occasional study entitled bank lending and capital also used input from previous dnb
research such as the examinations into the profitability of banks in times of recession and into
the effect of changes in bank credit policies on business lending in the netherlands insights
from dnb research into trade dynamics in the netherlands and the euro area contributed to
the advice on responsible and differentiated wage development


the research activities also delivered an important technical contribution to the econometric
models that dnb uses to predict the shortterm and mediumterm developments in the dutch

106   economy and the economic effects of various policy decisions in 2014 the delfi model used for
      this purpose was expanded in order to better describe the interaction between the real and
      financial spheres


      524 payments
      dnb actively promotes a safe reliable and efficient payment system in the netherlands and
      europe dnb functions as the chair and secretary of the national forum on the payment
      system maatschappelijk overleg betalingsverkeer  mob thirteen organisations participate
      in this consultative body representing providers and users of payment services with the aim
      of promoting the efficiency accessibility availability and safety of the dutch payment system
      dnb seeks to achieve these objectives both independently and under the aegis of the mob


      the robustness of the payment system is one of the issues that is currently being discussed
      following technical malfunctions in april 2013 the mob commissioned an examination later
      that year revealing that measures were needed with regard to online banking ideal and
      debit card payments the banks processors and the dutch payments association have taken
      concrete steps to resolve the problems the mob closely monitors the progress of these
      improvements and has asked the banks to raise their objectives


      the accessibility and availability of the payment system is particularly important for people with
      disabilities in 2014 in addition to its examination into the availability of atms see chapter 4
      the mob looked at ways of improving the accessibility of payment terminals the large
      variation in types of payment terminals at home and abroad impedes the blind and visually
      impaired in making debit card transactions this is why the mob together with the
      oogvereniging issued advice on improving the accessibility of payment terminals it also
      published a position paper to promote the use of accessible payment terminals in europe
      as these are manufactured internationally


      in 2014 the mob discussed the first evaluation of uniform safety regulations for electronic
      banking by private individuals the evaluation was carried out by the dutch payment
      association and the dutch consumers association the safety regulations were drafted in
      2013 also on the instigation of the mob they aim to harmonise regulations and policies of
      banks with respect to damage caused by online banking in order to improve transparency for
      consumers the evaluation shows that the regulations are effective and have led to increased
      awareness among consumers with respect to electronic banking the regulations will be
      reevaluated at the end of 2015


      headed by dnb the national forum on sepa migration nfs has since 2011 worked towards
      achieving the transition of the dutch payment system to the single euro payments area sepa
      and the relevant european standards such as iban by proposal of the european commission
      in early 2014 the minister of finance decided to postpone the transition to 1 august 2014
      until that date consumers and businesses could continue to use their old national bank

annual report




account numbers iban waiver the extra transition period was used to migrate the remaining      107
group of businesses and to familiarise consumers with the necessary adjustments to the
payment system to encourage consumers to start using the iban system the nfs set up a
promotional campaign during the summer months over to iban this campaign included
a dedicated website geared towards vulnerable groups such as the elderly and the disabled
explaining in clear and simple language what iban is where to find it and how to use it
safely the nfs decided to no longer convert existing account numbers to iban in online
banking from 1 august 2014 onwards as it confused consumers and led to transaction errors
and criminal abuse phishing charities were excepted they may continue to use their old
shorter bank account numbers until 1 february 2016 following the transition to sepa the nfs
was disbanded on 12 september 2014 as of that date the mob monitors sepa developments in
the netherlands mid2014 dnb set up a registration centre for iban discrimination to record
foreign institutions rejecting dutch ibans and vice versa following a complaint dnb will seek
a solution possibly through the foreign central banks involved


dnb research shows that paying by debit card can help most consumers in managing their
budgets however people from vulnerable groups prefer to pay in cash because this gives
them better insight into their spending in november 2014 dnb organised a workshop
for experts from banks the national institute for family finance information nibud and
consumer organisations on how these groups may be helped in managing their budgets using
electronic payment methods innovations that can make electronic means of payment suitable
for budget management by people from vulnerable groups should be able to provide a quick
and accurate overview of the amount of money still available for spending show them what
they spent their money on and help them in making responsible choices


dnb seeks to promote efficient recirculation of banknotes by encouraging market parties to
exchange suitable banknotes themselves wherever possible this should contribute to a more
efficient cash money cycle which uses fewer transport movements and is therefore safer and
more environmentallyfriendly one of the methods to achieve this is matching where banks
exchange banknotes among themselves instead of one bank submitting banknotes to dnb
for another bank to take them out again relative to 2013 the number of matched banknotes
rose by 27 dnb made the recommendation to the escb to continue using and recirculating
banknotes from an old series until they are rejected the escb concurred which means
that large amounts of banknotes are no longer destroyed unnecessarily dnb also invested in
innovative sorting technologies on an annual basis this saves more than 14 million banknotes
from being destroyed prematurely in cooperation with the ministry of finance dnb sold
hundreds of millions of used euro coins to other countries in 2014 to prevent needless melting
of coin surpluses

      box 51  dilemmas surrounding the payment system

      supported by the minister of finance and the lower house the dutch retail sector
      advocated faster processing of retail payments more specifically users both retailers
      and consumers require credit payments to be transferred to their bank accounts
      faster this ties in with the expansion of retail opening hours and the rise of the 24hour
      economy dnb acknowledges these needs and sees this trend towards faster processing
      as inevitable however research by dnb and the dutch payments association revealed
      that this would require fundamental and expensive adjustments to the processing
      infrastructure moreover part of this infrastructure is located abroad


      faster processing of payments should therefore be regarded in the context of european
      developments with the introduction of sepa a european payment market has emerged
      and the ecb emphatically promotes continuous direct processing of payments
      ie instant payments the dilemma is whether the dutch payment infrastructure
      should wait for developments at european level or play a pioneering role in developing
      methods for faster processing of payments being a pioneer could be advantageous
      for the dutch public but for the banks it would entail the risk of having to write down
      their investments should europe choose to use other techniques following european
      developments would cost less but would also fail to bring faster processing of
      payments closer


      another issue that emerged during the year under review was the question whether
      banks may put their customers payment data to commercial use or if this would be
      considered a breach of privacy  a difficult dilemma


      banks are informationintensive organisations they process huge amounts of data
      including payments in the context of their operational management processes
      technological developments such as the ongoing increase in computer processing
      power internet use and electronic payments and competition from large internet
      companies such as amazon and google that are now also offering payment services
      prompt the use of data for new activities on the other hand consumers depend on
      banks for their noncash payments utility function which means that banks must
      at all times seek to retain their customers trust incorrect use of data by banks would
      damage that trust in other words the fact that something is technically possible does
      not necessarily mean that it is permissible or desirable banks and payment institutions
      must comply with legislation and regulations but that is not enough in itself to retain
      trust they must be transparent and communicate clearly on their use of consumers
      payment data although dnb is not responsible for the protection of personal data
      it is responsible for monitoring sound and ethical operational management at banks

annual report




                                                                                                      109
   this requires sustainable business models including conscientious treatment of
   customers and their data in 2015 the mob will carry out an examination into
   consumers views on the use of customer data and privacy protection by banks



525 supervision
in its capacity as supervisor dnb promotes solid and sound financial institutions that live up
to their obligations and promises dnb is committed to maintaining a healthy and sustainable
financial sector sustainability relates to various aspects in supervision firstly it means that
the financial sector must adequately fulfil its public role and deliver added value to society
an important question in this regard is to what extent financial products and services
contribute to stable and sustainable economic development secondly a sustainable financial
sector must carefully and soundly weigh the interests of all stakeholders transparency
integrity and balanced decisionmaking are of the essence in this respect finally sustainability
means that the supervisory authority as well as the institutions must pay sufficient attention to
developments in the longer term to ensure that obligations can also be met in the future


2014 was a year of budding economic recovery following the peak of the crisis risk premiums
on peripheral government bonds in the euro area have fallen and most euro countries have
seen their economies pick up since the end of 2014 on the other hand the financial situation
is still uncertain disappointing macroeconomic developments and geopolitical tensions could
still turn the sentiment financial institutions must take account of these risks while they are
still in the middle of balance sheet recovery implementation of new regulations and reviewing
their business models and strategies in order to create a financial sector that is capable of
absorbing shocks and anticipating on changing circumstances the basic principle is that
financial institutions must comply with national and international legislation and regulations
in addition the financial sector should be aware of understand and manage all relevant risks
finally it is essential that it continues to work on restoring trust without trust a sustainable
financial sector cannot be achieved


last year saw a major change in banking supervision on 4 november 2014 the ecb was made
responsible for banking supervision in the euro area within a short period of time the ecb set
up a new organisation for direct supervision of 120 significant banks and indirect supervision
of the thousands of smaller banks in the euro area in preparation of the launch of european
banking supervision the ecb conducted a largescale investigation into the soundness of
banks this revealed that the examined dutch banks are adequately capitalised and sufficiently
capable of absorbing shocks the establishment of the european banking union strengthens
supervision in the euro area and reduces the likelihood of banks being unable to meet their
obligations or that they cannot be resolved in an orderly fashion this is how supervision
contributes to a financial sector capable of fulfilling its role in society in preparation for the
new approach and the allocation of powers in the single supervisory mechanism ssm

110   dnb has rearranged its organisation of supervision narrowing the span of control in all
      supervision divisions


      in 2014 insurance companies made significant progress in improving their risk management
      governance and reporting obligations to achieve a more riskbased and futureoriented
      supervisory framework under solvency ii dnb examined the resilience of european insurers
      in case of disappointing market developments in general dutch life insurers participating in
      this test were found to comply with the new capital requirements prescribed by the solvency ii
      framework however this was not the case for all individual dutch insurance companies
      which serves to demonstrate that a prolonged period of low interest rates can pose substantial
      challenges in 2014 dnb also published an exploratory study of the structural challenges
      affecting the future of the insurance sector and called on insurance companies to futureproof
      their business models


      the social and financial sustainability of the pension system also improved in 2014 a new
      financial assessment framework ftk has been agreed on which provides for a more
      shockproof stable and balanced pension system major changes with respect to governance
      communications and organisational structure were set in motion examples being the
      introduction of the pension fund governance further measures act the proposed pensions
      communications act and the proposed introduction of a general pension fund last but
      not least the ministry of social affairs and employment facilitated a broad public debate on
      fundamental reform of the pension system in its national pension dialogue with the aim of
      safeguarding the quality of the dutch pension system also in the longer term dnb contributed
      to the dialogue by identifying the key features of a sustainable pension system


      along with changing laws and regulations dnbs supervision is always evolving
      dnb recalibrated its supervisory strategy in its supervisory strategy 20142018 document
      building on its previous strategy plan dnb formulated four new ambitions in this strategy
      document 1 becoming a strong player within the ssm 2 basing supervision on thorough
      analyses 3 placing more emphasis on integrity supervision and 4 organising supervision as
      transparently as possible


      dnb strongly supports the ssm and wishes to play an active role in the development of an
      effective european supervisory organisation the ssm reinforces supervision from a european
      perspective allowing dnb to safeguard its ambition of promoting sound financial institutions
      its collaboration with the ecb and the national supervisory authorities also gives dnb the
      opportunity of addressing major findings arising from its supervision at a european level
      examples include supervision of conduct and culture and supervision of business models and
      strategies these examples underline the importance of a longterm perspective in european
      supervision

   box 52  balance as a key feature of a sustainable financial
   assessment framework

   in 2014 political agreement was reached on a new financial assessment framework
   ftk for pension funds it constitutes a major step in strengthening the financial
   sustainability of nonstate pension schemes dnb advised the ministry to develop
   an assessment framework that is not only shockproof and stable but also balanced
   in terms of representing the different generations the latter is certainly not easy
   to achieve but it is a necessary prerequisite for ensuring broad social support and a
   sustainable financial sector


   pension funds have a collective buffer to which different stakeholders lay a claim
   indexlinking is particularly important to the older generations as it improves their
   spending power early indexlinking has a negative effect on the buffer however
   which is also aimed at meeting future obligations with a fair degree of certainty
   sufficiently high buffers are therefore mainly important to the younger generations
   in other words a balanced consideration of the interests of all stakeholders is paramount


   the structure of the new ftk could help to maintain the balance between generations
   spreading financial setbacks over a longer period protects the older generations against
   abrupt annual curtailments on the other hand the stricter indexation conditions give
   the younger generations more certainty with respect to their future benefits
   the economic developments in the near future will determine the generational impact
   in the short term if the pressure on funding ratios increases any further the older
   generations will benefit from the longer time spread and when the economy recovers
   the younger generations will benefit from more responsible indexation conditions



at the same time the ssm boosts the reinforcement of dnbs supervision and analysis
this is illustrated by the introduction of onsite examinations which already is a common
component of supervision in other european countries and for which dnb established a
new supervision division in 2014 the onsite examinations place high demands on analysis
within the organisation and the quality and availability of data with the aim of promoting a
sustainable financial sector in which the interests of all stakeholders are carefully and soundly
balanced dnb regards transparency and integrity as key priorities transparency about the
performance of financial institutions enables stakeholders to ascertain to what extent their
interests are being considered and to respond for dnb transparency is a means of enhancing
the disciplinary function of its supervision in addition dnb undertook to improve transparency
about its own functioning in 2014 see chapter 3 this contributes to the level of accountability
regarding the performance of a supervisory authority that fits the publics expectations

112   at the same time integrity is an important precondition for maintaining and recovering
      trust in the financial sector in 2014 dnb carried out thematic examinations into the risks of
      bribery conflicts of interests money laundering and terrorist financing and the use of national
      and international benchmarks in the financial sector a specific example of dnbs efforts to
      strengthen the integrity of operational management is its collaboration with the dutch health
      care authority in improving claims processing by insurance companies as a result several
      insurers took measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of fraud another instrument that
      dnb uses to improve the integrity of the financial sector is screening managing directors
      supervisory directors and other policymakers of financial institutions the integrity and
      suitability of these officers are crucial towards ensuring a sound financial sector the aim of
      these screenings is to ensure that ultimately only individuals with sufficient knowledge and
      skills are employed as management and supervisory board members in the financial markets
      this will enhance the quality of operational management and restore confidence about
      1690 screenings were performed in 2014 a rise of over 40 compared to 2013 a total of 89
      of candidates passed the screening and 11 were either rejected or their application was
      withdrawn before dnb could issue a formal negative decision


      dnb investigated the possibilities of incorporating environmental social and governance esg
      risks into its supervisory approach for example on the basis of the pension fund governance
      further measures act pension funds must be open about their policy regarding green and
      social investments this is why in 2014 dnb on various occasions expressed its opinion on
      the pension funds public duty to engage in a dialogue with their members about sustainable
      investment policies in 2015 dnb will examine to what extent the pension funds are living up to
      this duty


      526 statistics
      dnbs statistics division supports dnb and the escb in the performance of their principal
      duties since november 2014 it has also supported the european banking supervision the flow
      of crd iv reports from the banks to dnb european banking supervision and the european
      banking authority eba came into full swing in 2014 supporting the european supervisory
      authorities in performing their duties for national supervisory purposes investment firms also
      started reporting to dnb in accordance with crd iv in the year under review in addition
      the preparations for reporting under the new alternative investment fund managers directive
      aifmd were completed these reports will provide more insight into the activities of asset
      managers and alternative funds including hedge funds and private equity funds  institutions
      that have attracted growing attention from supervisory authorities and policy makers since
      the crisis 2014 also saw the introduction of new data sets to support monetary and financial
      stability policy including a completely revised reporting framework for banks this framework
      meets more specific needs regarding support of monetary policy as well as the information
      required to comply with the requirements set out in the new macroeconomic handbooks
      issued by the imf and the un the ecbs statistical requirements for investment funds and
      securitisation vehicles have also been amended for this purpose in addition the statistics

annual report




division provided a new reporting framework for the tltros launched by the ecb in the                           113
course of 2014 as well as new payment systems statistics based on ecb regulations and
reports for bank lending to the sme sector the results of which are now published on the
dnb website the introduction of statistics on security holdings is another major innovation
the data on ownership of shares investment fund units and debt paper of various sectors and
banking groups that dnb collects can now be shared across the euro area these statistics
allow better mapping of interdependencies within the financial system dnb also reviewed
its balanceofpayments statistics in 2014 in addition to the methodological adjustments
following from the implementation of the imfs balance of payments manual 6 bpm6
the sources were also reviewed dnb aims to optimise the relation between the balance
of payments and the national accounts in increasingly close cooperation with statistics
netherlands in 2014 this joint effort led to the imf announcing that the netherlands as one
of the first countries in the world complies with the new special data dissemination standard
plus sdds plus these standards have been specially developed for countries with systemically
important financial sectors




53 cost development

the costs allocated to dnbs core tasks in 2014 amounted to eur 3764 million see table 51
which constitutes a budget overrun of eur 202 million this was caused by the costs for
carrying out the comprehensive assessment ca in the context of the introduction of
european banking supervision these costs had not been accounted for in the 2014 supervision

 including costs for the execution of the dgs

114   budget as the implications of this exercise could not be quantified at the time in a separate
      estimate for the minister of finance the costs for the ca were estimated to come in at between
      eur 425 million and eur 617 million realised costs for the ca totalled eur 459 million and
      will be passed on to the dutch banks involved these costs relate to the external support for
      audits appraisals checks modelling and project support as required by the ecb partly in the
      context of quality control dnbs supervision departments made a significant contribution to
      the ca owing to an internal reallocation of priorities


      as in previous years the costs for support were closely monitored a eur 44 million reduction
      is explained by lowerthanexpected staff costs for dnb as a whole due to marginal wage
      increases and pension costs that were eur 24 million lower than expected
      other material differences are explained below for each of the core tasks


      the financial stability core task shows an overrun of eur 08 million relative to the 2014
      budget the reason for this overrun is that additional legal advice was required in connection
      with the recovery of icesave deposits


      costs for the monetary stability core task and economic advice were eur 74 million
      lower than budgeted this is partly due to the postponed implementation of the reserves
      management support system eur 23 million and lowerthanexpected staff costs
      throughout the organisation in addition several divisions did not fill all vacancies in 2014


      the budget underrun for the payment system core task amounts to eur 72 million this is
      attributable to lowerthanexpected staff costs for dnb as a whole the fact that fewer guilder
      banknotes were submitted for exchange into euros eur 19 million and two projects being
      deferred to 2015


      the deployment of staff from the various supervision divisions for the comprehensive
      assessment accounts for eur 76 million of the total budget underrun of eur 121 million for the
      supervision core task as the primary deployment for regular supervision was about 20 ftes
      below budget dnb took various measures to compensate for the increased workload resulting
      from this shortstaffing deploying available resources flexibly where they were most needed
      ie where risks are the most significant for example the number of regular supervision visits
      to foreign branches regular supervision meetings and riskidentification programmes was
      reduced in 2014 as was the number of thematic examinations and fewer resources were
      made available for risk identification in addition dnb took some organisational measures in
      order to continue paying adequate attention to highrisk files the ca itself turned out to be
      an important riskmitigating factor for the banks and contributed to enhanced knowledge and
      skills of their staff that said the pressure on regular supervision was only compensated for
      temporarily but not structurally

annual report




in addition to deploying dnb staff for the ca the temporary staff costs for other projects were      115
also lower by eur 28 million than expected last but not least overall staff costs for dnb as a
whole were lower than expected in 2014


costs involved in the financial expertise centre fec were eur 02 million lower than budgeted
which was mainly attributable to savings on temporary staff costs


costs for the statistics core task overran the budget by eur 04 million due to the increased
number of hours devoted to the caesar project storage of dataoriented data streams
these are partly offset by lower staff costs for dnb as a whole


efficiency and legitimacy
dnb aims to achieve efficiency and legitimacy in its expenditure dnb instructed its external
auditor to assess the efficient and legitimate use of financial resources and to report on
efficiency in the findings to its auditors report on the accountability of its duties as an
independent public body legitimacy in this way dnb complies with its obligation under
the financial supervision funding act wet bekostiging financieel toezicht  wbft in order
to test dnbs efficiency the functioning of its planning and control pc cycle was assessed
establishing the connection between dnbs objectives and the costs incurred in achieving
them the actual costs in relation to the budget in the year under review provide a reliable
picture of dnbs efficiency dnb aims for a legitimacy rate of over 99 of its expenditure
the legitimacy rate for 2014 was 998 from 994 and 992 respectively in 2013 and 2012

      55 risk management

      551 risk management framework
      dnbs risk management framework is based on the internationally accepted coso enterprise
      risk management standard and the european banking authoritys eba methodology the risk

annual report




management framework provides for a comprehensive approach to risk management at dnb                117
important objectives of the framework include providing consistent information on risks and
incidents and preventing overlap and omissions in risk management


dnbs governance structure for comprehensive risk management is based on the three
lines of defence model the three lines of defence are line management risk management
supporting functions and internal control functions and the internal auditing department
they are independent functions each contributing to the quality of the risk management and
control system in 2014 the establishment of an operational risk board was initiated chaired
by the new secretarydirector the risk management process for all organisational units
comprises the following steps identification assessment response monitoring and reporting
based on these steps the main risks and measures to be taken are identified for each of the
organisational units where required the management may make the necessary adjustments
the outcome of this process is reported to the governing board on a quarterly basis the sb
discussed the functioning of the risk management and control systems


552 risk management for specific risk categories
dnb distinguishes strategic financial and operating risks in its risk management framework
managing dnbs strategic ambitions is the main objective of strategic risk management
financial risk management is described in section 56 operational risks include information
security risks process risks fraud risks business continuity risks physical security risks and
compliance and integrity risks in 2014 the emphasis with respect to operating risks was on
managing the following risk categories
	information security risks no significant incidents occurred at dnb owing to our high level
   of office it security and adequate maintenance dnb also initiated an awareness campaign
   on information security to keep staff alert to secure handling of dnbrelated information
	physical security is concerned with the security of buildings human resources and valuables
   and their secure transportation due to increasing national and international terrorist
   threats dnb analysed and improved its security
	fraud risk dnb updated its policy and conducted a number of fraud sensitivity analyses
   these analyses have contributed to further improvements in the management of fraud risks
	business continuity management bcm continuity agreements for various primary
   processes have been tightened contributing to further professionalisation of business
   continuity risk management
	compliance and integrity risks integrity is key to dnbs reputation and therefore constitutes
   an important core value in 2014 specific attention was devoted to strengthening the
   management of these risks at dnb an ethics framework was defined in the context
   of the ssm providing integrity guidelines for all parties involved in the ssm with a few
   adjustments dnbs integrity policy matches the ethics framework

118   553 main risks
      the main risks were identified based on the risk management process


      1 financial risks resulting from the european debt crisis
      the new and unconventional monetary measures recently introduced by the eurosystem lead
      to increased financial risks for dnb these risks are only partly covered by the guarantee issued
      by the dutch state in 2013 on crisisrelated dnb exposures since this guarantee does not apply
      to all exposures at the end of 2014 dnbs capital and buffers were sufficiently adequate to
      cover these risks


      2 cybercrime risks
      information is crucial to dnb in performing its duties to prevent loss or abuse of business
      assets such as information networks and systems as a result of cybercrime it is essential
      that dnb adequately secures its assets dnb keeps a close eye on human conduct as this is a
      decisive factor where cybercrime is concerned dnb regularly updates its information security
      policy and procedures with the aim of combating cybercrime and to safeguard the integrity and
      availability of information no significant incidents occurred in 2014 in this respect


      3 transition risks relating to the ssm
      with the introduction of the ssm banking supervision in the netherlands has changed
      fundamentally dnb has made the necessary adjustments to its supervisory organisation and
      working practice in order to adapt to the new structure in implementing its new working
      practice dnb may be faced with certain dilemmas or risks dnb is taking account of these
      risks and takes the necessary control measures where possible some of these concerns are
      already being addressed
      	a a new european guide to banking supervision has been compiled but practical
         experience still needs to be gained this requires frequent consultations with the ecb in
         order to transfer knowledge of the dutch banking sector and institutions
      	b the changes in banking supervision may not be completely clear to banks in the
         netherlands as the duties of the new supervisory authority ecb and the cooperation
         between the new and the former supervisors dnb and the afm have not yet been
         fleshed out
      	c a consequence of the introduction of european banking supervision is that priorities
         for the supervision of dutch institutions are set by the ecb restricting dnbs freedom of
         decisionmaking in the performance of its banking supervision duties
      	d the introduction of european banking supervision may put the link between specific
         dutch macroprudential and microprudential risks under pressure which may lead to the
         synergy between dnbs central banking and supervisory components not being fully used


      554 incontrol statement about financial reporting risks
      based on its evaluation dnbs governing board declares that with regard to the financial
      reporting risks in 2014 the internal risk management and control systems provide reasonable

management and control systems in respect of the financial reporting risks operated
satisfactorily in 2014




56 financial exposures

although the risk profile of dnbs balance sheet improved in 2014 the risk level remains high in
absolute terms the development of the risk profile reflects the developments on the financial
markets on the one hand the relative calm and the positive sentiment on the financial
markets have reduced the balance sheet and hence reduced the resulting risks on the other
hand the low inflation environment gave rise to new risks prompted by the start of new
unconventional monetary programmes interest income from monetary transactions and
ownaccount investments declined as a result of the low interest environment the 2014
fullyear result amounted to eur 951 million a fall of eur 227 million compared with 2013


due to the dominant role of monetary exposures dnb can only control the risk profile to some
degree the proceeds and risks of the joint monetary policy are mainly distributed in proportion
to the eurosystems capital key for the different national central banks total risk  determined
on the basis of the expected shortfall method 99 and scenario analyses and resulting from
direct and indirect eurosystem exposures  was relatively high amounting to eur 93 billion
see table 52 the exposures concerned are those on which dnb runs risks and differ from
the exposures as included on the balance sheet the state guarantee relating to exposures
resulting from support programmes partly mitigates these risks ensuring that dnbs financial

      561 monetary exposures
      further recovery of trust in 2014 led to a decline in exposures relating to the crisis measures
      taken in the context of the credit and debt crises exposure related to the securities market
      programme fell by eur 19 billion owing to repayments made by the governments of italy
      greece and spain see table 53 market perceptions of the risks on these governments
      also eased the interest rates on central government loans fell to an alltime low and credit
      ratings of in particular spain portugal and ireland were adjusted upwards the risk on the
      smp portfolio decreased significantly as a result in 2014 the banking institutions recourse to
      the eurosystem declined causing a significant fall in exposures from open market operations
      omo this development is partly attributable to the improved capital positions of banking
      institutions and their balance sheet reduction efforts the banks that had applied for
      emergency liquidity assistance also made substantial repayments

         direct exposure on governments in programme


      the trend of the real economy in the euro area with the added risk of deflation and further
      stagnation prompted the eurosystem to launch new unconventional programmes in september
      and december dnb extended credit to commercial banks in the form of targeted longerterm
      refinancing operations tltros the aim of these operations with a maturity of four years
      is to promote lending within the eurosystem in the last quarter of 2014 the eurosystem
      launched new unconventional purchasing programmes for covered bonds cbpp3 and

the programmes were limited both programmes have a twoyear maturity which will cause
the volumes and resulting risks to rise the risks ensuing from the programmes are not covered
by the state guarantee and are for dnbs own account in proportion to the capital key


from march 2015 dnb will start purchasing government bonds in particular under the expanded
asset purchase programme eapp intended monthly purchases including cbpp3 and abspp
at eurosystem level amount to eur 60 billion as the risks related to these purchases are only
shared to a limited extent 20 based on the capital key the default risk for dnb is also limited
if interest rates and deposit rates rise this may lead to refinancing losses for the programme


after the balance sheet date the exposure and ensuing risk relating to greece increased due to
outflows of money from this country

57 financial education and technical assistance

571 financial education
traditionally dnb provides financial education by informing the public on the core tasks of a
central bank and the functioning of the economy dnb has a visitors centre where these subjects
are explained to secondary and higher education students and other target groups in 2014
the visitors centre welcomed 17832 visitors mainly secondary school groups dnb also educates
the public on how to manage money and take responsible financial decisions by developing
educational materials such as brochures films online games posters and comic strips
in september 2015 the visitors centre will move from the achtergracht premises to the
sarphatistraat location which is currently being renovated the new dnb visitors centre will
also be open to individual visitors who can visit the general exhibition on the ground floor
without appointment school groups can book guided tours of the first floor which will feature
new and interactive exhibitions on dnbs core tasks


dnb also participates in the money wise platform wijzer in geldzaken an initiative of the
ministry of finance more than forty organisations from the financial sector the academic
world education and consumer organisations work together on this platform to educate
consumers and increase their financial awareness dnb is one of its four sponsors as in
previous years in 2014 dnb took part in the national money week organised by the platform
dnb staff members gave guest lessons at primary schools teaching children about money
matters moreover dnb supports child and youth finance international cyfi a global
organisation set up to promote financial awareness and skills in children that is active in over
one hundred countries in addition to providing moral support for the cyfis objectives and
participating in its events dnb has temporarily made a part of its office premises available to
the organisation free of charge


572 technical assistance
dnb has for years provided technical assistance to the central banks and supervisors of the
imf constituency representing the netherlands and belgium in the imf the constituency
comprises fifteen mostly eastern european countries a number of these countries have been
members of the european union for some time or aspire to membership the european union
sets high requirements on these countries in terms of institutional organisation legislation and

124   regulatory capacity dnbs assistance is aimed at improving the institutional and staffing
      capacities of fellow institutions in these countries due to current geopolitical tensions
      some other countries are also turning to europe which also generates demand for technical
      assistance supporting the imf constituency also serves a dutch interest a strong constituency
      is a prerequisite for holding a seat together with belgium in the daytoday management of
      the imf and thus to play a direct role in the imfs decisionmaking processes in view of the
      substantial financial claims that the netherlands has on the imf it is crucial to have a say in
      issues concerning the imfs financial soundness moreover the imf monitors international
      financial stability which is of great value to the netherlands as a small and open economy in
      2014 dnb deployed 53 ftes for technical assistance the quality of support is monitored by
      means of evaluation forms in 2014 an evaluation visit was made to one of the constituency
      countries in order to assess the results of the technical recommendations made in 2010 and
      provide further advice the visit was very successful the fact that the dutch director elected by
      the constituency can call on a number of advisers from the constituency countries contributes
      to the constituencys cohesion the director represents the interests of the constituency
      countries in the imf executive board the central bank presidents and ministers of finance of
      the constituency countries meet at least three times a year to discuss constituency matters

      581 implementation of csr policy
      dnbs csr policy encompasses the following five themes csr in relation to dnbs core
      tasks environmental aspects sustainable procurement social policy and social commitment
      each of these areas comprises a number of subjects or priority themes for which objectives
      are formulated and reports are made on an annual basis dnb uses the outcomes of the
      stakeholder dialogue on corporate social responsibility to further delineate its policy and
      set thematic priorities see the csr annex for more information on dnbs csr policy and
      explanatory notes to this accountability section


      stakeholder dialogue and materiality analysis
      at the end of 2013 dnb organised a stakeholder dialogue on its csr policy and how it is
      accounted for in the annual report the results formed the basis for a materiality analysis
      see dnbs 2013 annual report which was presented for consultation to a number of dnb key
      officials and representatives of financial institutions and government and governmentrelated
      organisations figure 1 presents an overview of the outcome of this feedback round confirming
      the outcome of the previous stakeholder dialogue the stakeholders and dnb agree that dnb
      can create the most significant impact through the performance of its core tasks the focus of
      dnbs csr policy therefore is on further integration and operationalisation of sustainability in
      its core tasks  as is also clear from this annual report in which dnb explains its csr profile
      more explicitly based on its core tasks the current materiality analysis largely corresponds
      to that included in dnbs 2013 annual report the importance and impact of the subject of

      involved in the design of the european supervisory organisation and also substantially changed
      its own organisation to tie in with the new european structure a new division was set up for
      significant institutions coming under direct supervision of the ecb as well as a banking division
      responsible for supervision of dutch banks that are not subject to the ecbs direct supervision

      in line with developments elsewhere in society dnb has introduced more sober conditions
      of employment as included in the new collective labour agreement which will come into
      effect at the start of 2015 for example this entails a more austere pension scheme leading to
      annual savings of eur 49 million over the next five years a personal choice budget pkb will
      be introduced allowing staff members to fund additional facilities or training courses all dnb
      staff members are covered by the collective labour agreement except for the governing board

      distribution part of the gold stock was relocated from new york to amsterdam now both
      locations hold 31 of the gold stock while stocks in ottawa and london remained unchanged
      in making this adjustment dnb has joined other central banks which hold a larger part of their
      gold stock in their own countries

interesting challenging jobs with ample opportunities for development through internal job
rotation and training

      that new managers are not only supported by their direct superiors but also by other dnb
      managers who can act as mentor peer review  discussing issues and cases with peers in a
      nonjudgemental setting  has proved to be very instructive a number of peer review groups
      were formed in 2014


      performance management
      the previously revised performance system was evaluated in 2014 to assess whether the new
      system contributes towards achieving the envisaged objectives improving performancebased
      appraisal by applying a sevenpoint assessment scale and by more clearly explaining the system
      to staff the evaluation shows that the sevenpoint scale has led to more differentiation and
      more uniform appraisals across the organisation

role in this respect supporting the organisation by raising awareness risk management and
giving advice ci monitors compliance with internal integrity regulations and advises the
organisation and staff members on integrity issues the department is also responsible for
following up on integrity incidents and complaints from outside the organisation


employees perception of integrity
a survey was held into employees perception of integrity at dnb in 2014 the outcome was
positive across the board most employees see dnb as an organisation where integrity is held
high by the organisation as a whole as well as by its individual employees the application
of the integrity regulations is sometimes perceived as complex however and managers
sometimes find it difficult to give substance to their integritypromoting role


development of integrity risks

that of other central banks and the ecb the outcome showed that compliance and integrity
are at the appropriate level dnbs integrity policy is in line with the recommendations drafted
at european level dnb has access to a great deal of confidential information which is of course
not meant to fall into the hands of third parties and has taken numerous measures to prevent
this from happening ci monitors compliance with the main rules for handling confidential
information and calls employees to account regarding their professional responsibility in
compliance with the integrity policy


ci  risk management

6 report of
the supervisory board
61   introduction                                                                                    135


the supervisory board devoted specific attention to a number of developments in 2014
these are set out in further detail in section 63 they primarily concern the european banking
union which was launched in phases from november 2014 onwards beginning with the
establishment of the single supervisory mechanism ssm followed by the single resolution
mechanism srm in this respect the review of the governance of de nederlandsche bank
dnb was also considered


62 composition appointments

the composition of dnbs governing board changed in 2014 following joanne kellermanns
decision not to opt for a second term starting on 1 november 2014 having joined the governing
board shortly before the financial crisis broke out she worked tirelessly throughout her seven
year term to help restore confidence in the financial sector the supervisory board owes her
a great debt of gratitude and welcomed the news that it had pleased his majesty the king to
name her commander in the order of orangenassau the composition of the supervisory
board also changed as hélène vlettervan dort decided to step down on 1 october 2014
after having served her first term the board is also highly appreciative of the contributions that
hélène vlettervan dort made to dnb jaap van manen was reappointed for a second term
with effect from 1 january 2015


the malefemale mix of both the governing board and the supervisory board changed as
a result of joanne kellermanns and hélène vlettervan dorts stepping down in the event
of appointment or reappointment the board will of course focus on the adopted profiles
which include the aim of diversity in conformity with section 131 of the bank act 1998
the supervisory board numbers a minimum of seven and a maximum of ten members at the
time of adoption of the 2014 financial statements the board consisted of seven members
who sat on the board throughout the year alexander rinnooy kan chair annemiek fentener
van vlissingen vicechair bert van delden secretary jaap van manen wim kuijken
governmentappointed member feike sijbesma and kees goudswaard


the participation of supervisory board members in the bank council remained unchanged
in 2014 wim kuijken occupies a seat on the bank council in his capacity as government
appointed supervisory board member bert van delden who has been designated by the board
as member of the bank council continued his membership in 2014 the composition of the
supervisory board its committees and the governing board is provided from page 5 of this
annual report the profiles of the supervisory and governing board members as well as the
other positions that they hold can be found on dnbs website

136   63 activities

      during the year under review the supervisory board held six plenary meetings in the presence
      of the governing board and one meeting without the presence of the governing board
      the average attendance rate of its members was over 95 none of the members were
      regularly absent the chair of the supervisory board and the president were in frequent contact
      about issues concerning the supervisory boards work the activities of the boards committees
      are described in sections 64 to 66 below


      as part of the supervisory boards supervision of the management and the general course of
      business at dnb the board discussed the financial results for 2014 in the audit committee and in
      its plenary meetings these discussions were based on the accounting and financial markets
      reports the management letters from the external auditor and the internal audit department iad
      and the iad quarterly reports one recurring issue was the development of dnbs balance
      sheet risks as a result of the conditions in the financial markets the relative calm seen in the
      markets did not lead the board to devote less attention to monetary policy and economic
      recovery in the euro area the president informed the board about the further easing of
      monetary policy related to the persistently low inflation such as the announcement by the ecb
      on 22 january 2015 of a largescale asset purchase programme and the concerns that governing
      board members have about the programme in march 2013 the dutch state issued a guarantee
      for dnbs crisisrelated assets in view of the financial risks on dnbs balance sheet at the
      time of adoption of the financial statements these financial risks had not led to actual losses
      accordingly dnb did not call on the state guarantee


      the net profit for 2014 came to eur 951 million 2013 eur 1178 million and the distribution
      to the dutch state amounted to eur 903 million dnb will again refrain from distributing an
      interim dividend for the 2014 financial year


      no gold sales took place in 2014 from time to time the supervisory board discusses the
      governing boards considerations concerning the gold stock it exchanged views with the
      governing board about changes to the location policy


      the supervisory board held detailed discussions with the governing board about the 2014
      financial statements which meetings were also attended by the external auditor the opinion
      of the external auditor and the iads analyses were included in these discussions pursuant to
      section 196 of the articles of association the supervisory board subsequently adopted dnbs
      financial statements and presented them for approval to the general meeting of shareholders
      on 11 march 2015 the latter approved the financial statements and discharged the governing
      board of responsibility in respect of its management and the supervisory board in respect of its
      supervision

annual report




the supervisory board discussed the budget for 2015 including the independent public body             137
budget and approved it on 21 november 2014 the supervisory board established that the
internal operational and control instruments such as the planning and control cycle and
the risk management and control system operated effectively with no specific points for
attention emerging having been discussed by the supervisory board and the governing board
the independent public body budget was reviewed in the annual budget meeting with the
ministry of finance and the ministry of social affairs and employment this budget provides for
an additional amount of eur 5 million earmarked for making the transfer to european banking
supervision a success the supervisory board welcomes the fact that the governing board
practises transparency in the budgeting process


one of the most important developments in 2014 was the phased launch of the european
banking union together with the other european national supervisory authorities and the
ecb dnb changed over to the single supervisory mechanism ssm on 4 november 2014
the european banking union was on the agenda of all supervisory board meetings and was
discussed at supervision committee meetings and in the board members permanent
learning programme the comprehensive assessment of significant banks played a key part
in preparations for the ssm these external developments also have important consequences
internally as do developments with regard to the srm and dnb being designated as the
national resolution authority for which task a new division was created


the pivotal changes prompted by the launch of the banking union have brought widereaching
changes for dnb not only in terms of how supervisory processes are structured but also
for dnbs statistics function and internal operations and accordingly its overall governance
the supervisory board discussed these topics and the interplay between them with the
governing board primarily in meetings of the remuneration and appointments committee


the governing board and the supervisory board announced on 6 june 2014 that joanne
kellermann had decided not to opt for a second term as member of the governing board
the move towards european banking supervision brings a number of changes including a
significant transfer of decisionmaking powers in respect of prudential banking supervision to
the ecb which is why the supervisory board in common with the governing board felt that
the work portfolios could be redistributed among the remaining members of the governing
board on the one hand the new distribution does justice to the basic principle of having
sufficient checks and balances in place to ensure a careful decisionmaking process within
the governing boards peerbased decisionmaking model on the other hand it ensures that
the synergies between its duties are utilised to the full in addition the redistribution of duties
meets the requirements governing operations in the context of the ssm and srm within the
various spheres of responsibility duties are coherent and logical enabling a proportional
division of duties among the governing board members

138   the redistribution effective since 1 november 2014 means that the president is now also
      responsible for managing internal operations at dnb in addition to occupying a seat on the ecb
      governing council and bearing substantive responsibility as chair of dnbs governing board
      femke de vries now holds the newlycreated position of secretarydirector managing the
      internal operations departments in the presidents portfolio under his immediate responsibility
      she also bears responsibility for followup to the recommendation from the board effectiveness
      study commissioned by the governing board that more attention should be devoted to
      organisational management and ensuring that board decisions are put into practice throughout
      the organisation the study resulted from the action plan for a cultural change in dnbs
      supervision as part of which the governing board arranged for a board effectiveness review
      with external support the outcome of the review was discussed with the supervisory board
      and will enable the latter to optimise its assessment of the degree of control exercised by the
      governing board


      the executive director of monetary affairs and financial stability has been entrusted with
      the responsibility for payments the responsibility for prudential supervision continues to be
      allocated to two executive directors of supervision the current executive director responsible
      for banking supervision and the supervision policy division also bears responsibility for
      insurance supervision while his counterpart heads pension supervision horizontal supervisory
      functions and integrity supervision and legal services


      dnbs new resolution duty is to be performed separately and independently of monetary policy
      financial stability and banking supervision allocation of the resolution duty to the second
      executive director of supervision mentioned above means that this basic principle has been
      complied with


      the changes in governance resulted in amendments to the bank act 1998 dnbs articles
      of association and its rules of procedure as adopted by the supervisory board and posted
      on dnbs website with regard to the allocation of duties within the supervisory board
      the supervision committee discusses ssmrelated topics the board has decided to discuss
      topics relating to the srm and dnbs macroprudential policy in its plenary meetings for the
      time being


      in anticipation of the launch of the ssm the governing board changed the structure of dnbs
      supervisory divisions with effect from 1 november 2014 combining this with its wish to bring
      the span of control of the knowledgeintensive departments into line with that prevailing at
      comparable organisations a basic principle was that changes would be implemented without
      raising the cost base staffing levels and the distribution of staff among the various divisions
      will be determined at a later stage using a bottomup approach to establish to what extent
      such staffing levels enable dnb to carry out adequate supervision of all sectors while also
      meeting all ssm requirements

annual report




regarding general business matters the supervisory board devoted a great deal of attention        139
to adjustments made to dnbs pension scheme it also discussed the strengthening of the
interrelations between micro and macroprudential supervision at dnb the supervisory
board in each of its meetings devoted close attention to the periodic update on core task
related issues discussing a wide range of subjects at each meeting the president for instance

economic conditions in the netherlands repeatedly focused on lending the supervisory board

of the supervisory board and its committees as no appointments to the supervisory board
were made in 2014 no orientation programme was organised in the year under review

applying to the european central bank ecb and the european system of central banks escb
hereafter escb accounting policies and the harmonised notes to the balance sheet and the
profit and loss account otherwise the financial statements observe the provisions of part 9 of
book 2 of the dutch civil code in line with the provisions of section 17 of the bank act 1998


the escb accounting policies are broadly in line with financial reporting principles generally
accepted in the netherlands in deviation from part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code
a	unrealised gains from assets and liabilities measured at revalued amounts are not recognised
     in the profit and loss account but included in a revaluation account in the balance sheet
b no cash flow statement is included


comparison with preceding year
the accounting policies have not changed compared with the preceding year the presentation
of the financials has changed in one respect in line with the escb accounting policies the item
net claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the eurosystem is now
presented before rather than after other intraeurosystem claims net the items have been
renumbered accordingly


general
gold and gold receivables and on and offbalance sheet claims and liabilities denominated
in foreign currency are valued at market prices prevailing at the end of the financial year the
valuation of securities is based on data that result in realistic and representative market values
the use of last trading day data may result in values that are influenced by occasional factors
which may compromise the valuation this is why dnb has decided effective from 2014 to use
the price data of the nexttolast trading day of the year to arrive at the yearend valuation
the remaining assets and liabilities are carried at cost or at face value less any accumulated
impairment losses transactions in financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the financial
statements as at the settlement date with the exception of foreign exchange transactions
interest rate swaps and the related accruals which are reported as at the trade date in
accordance with the economic approach revaluations arising from price differences in
respect of securities are determined on a portfoliobyportfolio and securitybysecurity basis
revaluations arising from exchange rate differences are determined on a portfoliobyportfolio
and currencybycurrency basis unrealised revaluation gains are taken to revaluation
accounts unrealised revaluation losses are recognised in revaluation accounts to the extent
that the revaluation accounts balance is positive any shortfall is recognised in the profit
and loss account at the end of the financial year exchange rate revaluation losses on any
one currency are not netted against exchange rate revaluation gains on any other currency or
against price revaluation gains price revaluation losses on a security are not netted against
price revaluation gains on another security or exchange rate revaluation gains

148   for gold and gold receivables no distinction is made between price revaluation and exchange

for the five years following the year of the cash changeover5 the intraeurosystem balances        151
arising from the allocation of euro banknotes are adjusted in order to avoid significant changes
in ncbs relative income positions as compared with previous years the adjustments are
effected by taking into account the differences between the average value of banknotes put
into circulation by each ncb in the reference period6 and the average value of banknotes that
would have been allocated to them during that period using the eurosystem capital key the
adjustments are reduced in annual stages until the first day of the sixth year after the cash
changeover year from then on the income on banknotes is allocated fully to the ncbs in
proportion to their paidup shares in the ecbs capital this year there were adjustments as
a result of the accession of národná banka slovenska in 2009 eesti pank in 2011 and latvijas
banka in 2014 these adjustments will expire on 31 december 2014 2016 and 2019 respectively

8 share of euro banknotes in circulation allocated to the ecb as well as the income arising
from securities purchased through the securities markets programme smp monetary
forward transactions the assetbacked securities purchase programme abspp and the
third covered bond purchase programme cbpp3 will accrue in full to the ncbs in the year
in which this income is realised unless the ecbs governing council decides otherwise the
ecb will in january of the following year distribute this amount to the ncbs in the form of an
interim profit distribution7 the amount will be distributed in full unless the ecbs net profit
for the year is lower than the combined income from banknotes in circulation and the above
mentioned purchase programmes the amount concerned may be reduced by the expenses
of the ecb arising from the issue and handling of euro banknotes subject to a decision to
that effect by the ecbs governing council in addition it may be added to a provision for
foreign exchange rate interest rate and gold price risks after adoption by the ecbs governing
council the remaining profit is distributed to the ncbs of the eurosystem in proportion to their
weightings in the eurosystem capital key the amount distributed to dnb is reported in the
profit and loss account in income from equity shares and participating interests

          shareholders equity of the bis is based on the 2014 annual financial statements
          financial year from 1 april 2013 through 31 march 2014




      the equities consist of equity index investments in 2014 dnb switched the equity indexes
      reported in other financial assets to equity index funds with a csr exclusion policy
      these funds follow the msci index but exclude companies that do not comply with the
      un global compact principles these principles are aimed at preventing abuse in the areas
      of human rights the environment labour and corruption this switch did not result in the
      realisation of unrealised gains insofar that equities were involved that were effectively retained
      after the switch the reason is that  in substance  the risk profile expected return and

 provision for monetary policy operations
in accordance with article 324 of the escb statute the provision against the risk of default
on the part of counterparties has been divided within the eurosystem among the ncbs of
the participating member states in proportion to their capital key in the year of default
this provision was released in full in 2013


 provision for employee benefits
dnb operates the following arrangements
 a defined benefit pension scheme
 a contribution to the health care insurance premiums of pensioners limited group
 a service anniversary and retirement bonus arrangement
 a social plan arrangement

174   until the end of 2014 dnbs pension scheme was an indexlinked careeraverage scheme
      with guaranteed indexation13 in line with general wage increases pensions of existing
      pensioners and pension rights of former dnb employees are indexed only if the pension funds
      financial position so permits to address dnb pension funds funding deficit which originated
      in the past the fund has drawn up a recovery plan to make up for the deficit a premium
      policy has been drawn up under which the fund will restore its minimum own funds level
      within a period of five years as from end2008 and recover to the required level within
      15 years as at 31 december 2014 the funding ratio of the pension fund dnb based on the
      ultimate forward rate in line with dnb requirements stood at 1174 so that a state of
      underfunding did not exist on that date since the pension contributions paid are recognised
      as an expense no provision has been created


      the contribution towards the health insurance premiums payable by pensioners is an
      allowance for a limited group of pensioners towards the costs concerned and may be
      characterised as a temporary transitional arrangement


      the service anniversary and retirement bonus arrangement provides for bonuses payable to
      staff upon 20 30 and 40 years service and for bonuses payable to staff upon retirement and
      payments made to surviving dependants

      in return for another currency at a specific rate and for delivery at a date in the future
      these positions are shown offbalance sheet at the forward rate differences between the
      spot and forward rates for currency swaps and forwards are amortised and taken to the profit
      and loss account unamortised forward results are recognised in the balance sheet under

although the financial risks for dnb decreased in 2014 as a result of the measures taken
by the eurosystem to stabilise the operation of the euro area they are still at a high level
the financial risk excluding gold as at 31 december 2014 was determined at eur 93 billion
dnb uses the expected shortfall es method to measure and manage its financial risks
with various scenarios being played out the resulting estimated risk is higher than the total
capital and reserves of eur 79 billion in march 2013 given the risks arising from the debt crisis
the minister of finance issued a free and unconditional guarantee of up to eur 57 billion on
the basis of the scenario risks the guarantee relates to dnbs share in possible losses on
crisisrelated exposures in the monetary portfolios14

      liability claims and procedures
      by reason of its supervisory task or otherwise dnb may receive liability notices or
      preannouncements of such notices in some cases liability proceedings have been brought
      against dnb where the liability amounts cannot reasonably be estimated or where reasonable
      doubts remain as to whether a liability will have to be settled dnb suffices by disclosing such
      cases in the notes the governing board saw no reason to make a provision on this account in
      the reporting period the relevant current cases are discussed in more detail below


      claims of fortis shareholders
      a group of belgian fortis shareholders has brought proceedings against dnb  as well as
      against the dutch state and fortis  before the brussels commercial court in an action that
      includes a claim for damages of eur 5 per share it is not known how many shares are involved
      in its ruling of 8 december 2009 the commercial court honoured the dutch states and dnbs
      invocation of immunity in these proceedings some of the fortis shareholders appealed against
      this ruling in 2011 in 2013 the appeal court ruled that the dutch state and dnb cannot be
      tried before a belgian court on the grounds of immunity in july 2014 the fortis shareholders
      appealed against this ruling with the supreme court


      receivers in the bankruptcy of dsb bank and several interest groups
      in november 2013 the receivers in the bankruptcy of dsb bank and several interest groups
      of accountholders at dsb bank summoned dnb before the amsterdam district court
      the claimants asked the court to conclude that dnb had acted unlawfully and is therefore
      liable to pay damages arising from the bankruptcy of dsb bank in december 2014
      the amsterdam district court held an oral hearing in this case a ruling is expected in the
      first quarter of 2015


      gsfs asset management bv stichting gsfs pensionfund and some individual pension
      scheme participants
      gsfs asset management bv stichting gsfs pensionfund and thirteen individual pension
      scheme participants instigated legal proceedings in february 2014 one of their claims is that
      dnb acted unlawfully towards the pension fund the asset manager and the pension fund
      participants by deciding that the pension fund did not qualify as a pension within the meaning
      of the pensions act pensioenwet and that its pension fund registration would be revoked
      the amsterdam district court dismissed the claimants claims in its ruling of 28 january 2015
      this ruling may be appealed

the monetary income pooled by the eurosystem ncbs is to be allocated among the ncbs in
proportion to the subscribed capital key monetary income pooling and redistribution leads
to redistribution effects such effects may arise from on the one hand differences between
eurosystem ncbs with respect to returns on certain earmarked assets or interest paid on
related liabilities on the other hand the shares of earmarkable assets and related liabilities of
those national banks differ from the shares in the total earmarked assets and related liabilities
allocated to the ncbs according to the eurosystem capital key for dnb the result of monetary
income pooling of eur 50 million 2013 eur 485 million arises from the difference between
the monetary income pooled by dnb amounting to eur 619 million and the monetary income
reallocated to dnb based on the capital key amounting to eur 569 million in addition
2014 saw adjustments to the redistribution of monetary income in 2008 through 2013
