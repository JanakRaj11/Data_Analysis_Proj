    a safe accidentfree
    company
    fostering an acute awareness of
    safety in the workplace on the part of
    each and every employee is as impor
    tant to establishing a safe business
    environment as instituting technologies
    and systems to prevent accidents
    the cosmo oil group focuses daily on
    safety in order to build an environment
    in which employees are able to work
    with peace of mind placing the high
    est priority on safety at all times and
    working to eliminate accidents entirely
    the cosmo oil group is committed to
    building a society where all people can
    feel safe and secure




        cosmo oil has focused on human resource development as the              last year the company is also putting effort into emergency
        foundation for safe operations this is based on the belief that         training to teach employees how to deal with disasters
        people are the ultimate line of defense when it comes to safety the           the role of the technical training center is to provide support
        companys technical training center was established in 1994 as a         for the improvement of operation techniques and safety aware
        place for employees to acquire techniques for operating oil production   ness among operation personnel from the standpoint of frontline
        equipment and to learn ways to deal with any problems that may arise    manufacturing although responses to frequently occurring
             in addition to learning on simulators for each piece of equip      incidents are covered by the regular training in order to further
        ment trainees learn about the design of machinery using miniature       improve safety in reﬁneries we must foster the ability for people
        devices the main objective is for trainees to learn normal operat      to think for themselves make decisions and take proper action
        ing techniques however after the great east japan earthquake           when emergencies or unforeseen circumstances arise


                                                        trainee comment
                                                        the simulators are identical to the actual equipment including the operations and alarm
                                                        sounds this helped us learn how to handle the actual equipment for speciﬁc products
                                                        the training on the simulator gave us conﬁdence about operating the real machinery
                                                        having the training makes a big difference in terms of how easy it is to do the job even
                                                        though it was just on the simulator we all felt a great sense of accomplishment when
                                                        we ﬁrst performed an operation correctly it gave us a real sense of personal growth

         using the volunteer leave program i helped out with earthquake     surprisingly my biggest shock came when i became the recipi
         reconstruction work in ishinomaki city miyagi prefecture from      ent of concern from a local person i met there he said to me
         september 1 to 16 2011 the number of eligible days for the         tohoku has been devastated but what are you doing to prepare
         volunteer leave program was increased after the great east           for earthquakes in other regions i was embarrassed to realize
         japan earthquake and so i was able to take half a month of          that while being so eager to serve as a volunteer i had neglected
         leave using the new program and paid absence                        to make my own personal disaster readiness preparations
               the reason i participated in volunteer earthquake                   thats why this experience became an opportunity to renew
         reconstruction work was that i wanted to see the situation in the    my awareness of dangers on the job i would also like to use
         disaster region with my own eyes rather than just thinking about    my recent volunteer experience to increase disaster prevention
         it and i thought i would learn a lot through new experiences       awareness throughout the entire sakaide reﬁnery


                                                                    i think the situation in the disaster area after the great east japan earthquake
                                                                    has affected everyone so deeply that we all wish we could volunteer to help
                                                                    feeling a bit envious of mr ishibashis ability to take action i sent him off with
                                                                    my best wishes for a safe return after coming back from his volunteer leave
                                                                    it was obvious that his awareness had been changed by the experience
                                            tsukasa shitsukawa      in the future if an employee indicates a desire to take volunteer leave i will

   morikawa asked him about how the cosmo oil group                    as of march 2012

   should promote csr and environmental management

   morikawa cosmo oil emphasizes harmony and symbiosis                   sources and make a smooth transition that is the general
   among society humankind and the environment and pursues              direction you should be heading

   this effort began with the cosmo oil eco card fund                    made a fullscale entry into the wind power business by wel
   ueda the eco card fund is a great initiative however it is          coming ecopower co ltd as a subsidiary in march 2010
   necessary to further clarify the signiﬁcance of these activities      ueda i have to say that japan is still lagging behind in the
   i think it is important to consider csr and management in an           renewable energy ﬁeld but by implementing two major
   integrated way                                                        mechanism changes progress can be expected one is
   morikawa you mean incorporating csr into the business                 balanced development for regional economies and the other
   itself                                                                is development of new production technology infrastructure
   ueda exactly it is important for the main business to have           morikawa certainly we can expect a lot from the develop

   morikawa in order to ensure our business activities as an             ueda if cosmo oil employees come together to work on

increased to 1790 kiloliters of freight per trip an improvement of 005 kiloliters year on year while unit
energy consumption also improved to 3626 kiloliters per trip an improvement of 015 kiloliters year on
year actual energy consumption from diesel oil was up 10 year on year but the total freight volume
increased signiﬁcantly so that the unit energy consumption improved year on year the company will
continue striving to achieve further energy reductions through efﬁciency improvements centering on
systematic and drivercontrolled deliveries
     for marine transport involving the use of coastal tankers the company is making ongoing efforts to
maintain high stowage rates and use larger tankers however due to circumstances such as accidents
at the chiba reﬁnery and production stoppages during the great east japan earthquake unit energy
consumption from marine transport was 662 klmtkm up 048 klmtkm or 78 year on year the
company will continue working to reduce energy consumption in ﬁscal 2012 taking into account the fact
that production will resume at the chiba reﬁnery

been installed at eight service stations in kanagawa prefecture tokyo
osaka prefecture and shizuoka prefecture in an active effort to
provide necessary infrastructure for the spread of evs led lighting is
being used at nine service stations including those with led lighting
for canopies only while new service stations are being designed
to incorporate allled lighting including in signage the cosmo oil
group will continue to examine and ﬁnd ways to make service stations

eco ofﬁce activities
the cosmo oil group conducts eco ofﬁce activities to reduce the amount of copy paper used the
amount of fuel consumed by company vehicles and the amount of electricity consumed at its ofﬁces
every employee is engaging in initiatives to achieve reduction targets set by each workplace
     the group achieved each goal established for ﬁscal 2011 with targets being set by taking the aver
age performance for the ﬁscal years from 2007 to 2009 and multiplying it by the reduction rate notably
the group attained a signiﬁcant reduction of electricity consumption at ofﬁces in response to energy
savings campaigns instituted after the great east japan earthquake as ofﬁces in areas serviced by tokyo
electric power and tohokuelectric power raised their reduction goals
