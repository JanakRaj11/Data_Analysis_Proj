message from the chief executive officer
and the managing director

dear shareholders

           qtcs road to sustainability has not been paved with roses every step has been made by overcoming
countless obstacles requiring excellent understanding trust and cooperation from all stakeholders inside and outside
the organization to solve problems and overcome those barriers together

           the first half of the year is naturally a low season for the electrical transformer business while the latter half
of the year is our high season this was also true in 2015 the first half of the year had low purchase orders due to
stagnant transformer demand domestic and foreign economic uncertainty in addition to high price competition thus
we made the decision to accept profitable jobs opportunity in crisis is a key concept of our management we use
this opportunity to prepare and make improvements to reduce costs in the production process management team skill
improvements and boost competitive capacity by using total quality management tqm this enabled our performance
in the second half of 2015 to achieve sales figures higher than 1000 million baht with higher profit ratios from the previous
year all of this was possible with cooperation from all stakeholders

           nevertheless we are well aware that all actions have both positive and negative impacts on stakeholders
such as economic social and environmental impacts we assessed risks prioritized and worked responsibly in every
aspect

           another major social problem with potential impact on qtcs sustainable growth is our discovery that high
competition overall improvements developments and meticulous production processes to minimize social and environmental
impacts to produce high quality transformers meeting world standards and build satisfaction among customers has
created pressure for our teams in qtcs inner society we have found that employee happiness is lower while love
and attachment to the organization is down therefore we began to survey for organization happiness and modify
happinessbuilding processes in the organization to build work life balance and raise happiness levels so organization
members will have sustainable happiness




                                                                                                                            3

amorphous transformer research and development
           in the project to experiment with amorphous transformer installation and utilization in the distribution system
of the metropolitan electricity authority when the company signed a memorandum with the metropolitan electricity
authority and hitachi metals ltd on 11 december 2014 the company delivered two amorphous transformers to the
metropolitan electricity authority for installation and real utilization in the distribution system the company is unable to
disclose installation sites and details in the memorandum
            in modifying amorphous transformer production processes to reduce production costs the research and
development team redesigned production designs from results obtained from testing amorphous transformers at multiple
sizes to solve errors in early amorphous transformer models furthermore the team developed skills in amorphous
transformer production which differs from normal transformer production until the team has more expertise with the
ability to produce quickly and reduce production costs nevertheless amorphous transformers remain unpopular due
to high price competition in the market and users continue to not place importance on energy conservation thus a
push from the public sector is necessary
            nevertheless the company sent amorphous transformers to test for endurance against crosscurrents at cesi
italy and has continued to develop amorphous transformers to push for greater acceptance for amorphous transformers
to be used more frequently in thailand in the future

            sustainability report 2015



           in addition the 2015 social mixer was more special due to the fact that the company provided free massage
services for participants with massage 12 beds and a massage team from a social health enterprise dr poonchai
jitananwittaya the chairman of community health enterprises came to lecture the public on knowledge about healthcare
and prevention of aches caused by work the company intends to provide income support for social health enterprises

           the social mixer created a new project for participation in community development with the major project
being occupational seminars for high school students at ban saphan see to spend free time with benefit because most
of the students were children of migrant workers working at industrial factories in pluak dang the adolescent children
had problems from being in the risk group without returning home after school parents who worked in factories without
time for family and care for children sufficiently causing a gap between groups making youths susceptible to substance
abuse or poor choices in life

hot air reduced energy consumption from hot air vacuum modifications
           the hot air vacuum is a machine used in the production process to vacuumdry the inner components of
transformers with high energy consumption the energy team used a themoscan and found loss of thermal energy
from the hot air vacuum because the cabinet connection points have invisible micro fractures and gaps under the
closed door therefore the company assigned the maintenance team to make modification plans by installed more
heat insulation at locations detected by the themoscan and install fireresistant bricks to insulate heat under the closed
door modifications experimented by collecting real power use while vacuuming the inner components from a 500 kva
transformer were found to be able to reduce power consumption by 16 kwhround or a power cost conservation by
approximately 64 bahtvacuuming round hypothesized power cost at four bahtunit
          furthermore the maintenance team in cooperation with the vacuum and oil filling station improved the
work plan further with kaizen by installing a timer relay to time when the heater works formerly the hot air vacuum
requires a person to turn it on after work and turn off when the morning production cycle arrives which was a total of
15 hours per vacuuming cycle causing waste of energy after installing a timer relay vacuum time dropped to only
nine hours per cycle

oil and air mass separator
           problems were encountered with the vacuum machines oil filtering function for large transformers in that
transformer oil particles flowed down the vacuum pipe and entered the vacuum machine when filling transformer oil and
vacuuming transformer oil particles will be mixed with the vacuum machine oil causing the vacuum machine to lose
air suction efficiency with oil heat along the pipe and on the ground thereby requiring the vacuum oil to be changed
and the floor cleaned every time in addition to costing the company in terms of expenses and time for changing oil and
cleaning the floor
          due to the aforementioned problem mr kosin moontep a production department maintenance staff member
made modifications kaizen by modifying a disused transformer conservator tank into a tank for separating oil and air
before entering the vacuum causing transformer oil particles which are heavier than air to fall to the tank bottom the
air was sucked into the vacuum machine and worked at full efficiency this modification helped to reduce expenses in
changing the vacuum machine oil and helped to extend time for changing vacuum oil and cleaning floors

water
           qtc factors located in places without public water natural resources or utilities can only pump surface water
for use in consumption water is not used during the production phase in manufacturing transformers water is only
used for cooling in the circulation of the hot air vacuum water is also used to reduce temperature in welding parts
by trapping water in a reclaimed water system where water can be used yearround the problem encountered is
that groundwater levels are insufficient and we are unable to pump enough water up for use consequently water is
supplied by outsourcing which means using water pumped from a canal or reservoir to be used for washing thus
the observation of where has all the water gone has been made
           in early 2014 the maintenance team conducted a study called where has all the water gone in this
study a meter was installed to measure the water volume pumped up from the surface and another meter was installed
at the destination where the most water was used for the purpose of measuring the volume of water used based on
the findings the volume of water pumped was higher than the volume of water actually used this shows that water
is wasted in the pipes before it exits the end meter
          the main pipe system is buried under the concrete of the factory which makes it difficult to inspect therefore
the team had to study and place new water pipes for the factory at certain spots and connect those pipes to the original
system in order to solve the problem and make inspection an easy matter these activities took a rather long period
of time and were completed in late 2014
          the results of this improvement have enabled the company to view the waste involved in using energy to
