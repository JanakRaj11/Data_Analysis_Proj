management approach

  useful metaphor for explaining the management approach and existence of a
  company could be a pine tree

  the trunk represents the fundamental management approach the compo
  nents of which are denkstatt mission values and code of conduct as well as
  denkstatt group balance score card bsc

  every branch represents the strategy review cycle on a group level where
  all managing directors are discussing together the material topics and take
  decisions during the summer strategy meeting group strategic goals are
  agreed and during the winter review meeting group balance score card is
  reviewed as well as local developments are shared and reviewed goals and
  commitments are spread in the 4 dimensions knowledge influence service
  and people

  roots of the pine tree are the operations in the different countries austria
  bulgaria hungary romania serbia slovakia spain there is no headquarter
  all are providing strength and stability to the pine tree there are few impor
  tant ingredients for the good quality of life of the pine tree water nutrients
  light and air water is received as constant feedback from people clients
  partners nutrients are denkstatt performance management system  on
  organizational level and personal level light is provided by the shareholder
  reviews and their support to achieve denkstatt trinity of goals economic suc
  cess mission fulfillment and worklife balance air is the support denkstatt
  got from all sustainability supporters

  manage external impacts not external perceptions

  imagine a new copper mine smelter waste incinerator or large hydroelectric dam such business projects are likely
  targets for negative pr campaigns but they exist to fill a need  like keeping our lights on or to take care of a problem
   like city waste companies who develop these projects often think they need pr management when in reality they
  need a vision and strategy that will make them the sustainable leaders in their industries it could be quite a chal
  lenge  cement factories contribute around 5 of global carbon emissions but such a great challenge also brings
  great returns  the margins for heavy industry in terms of co2 water and resource savings not to speak of circular
  economy potential are truly magnificent at the same time the social and economic opportunities  in terms of new
  jobs and skills new sme creation along the supply  distribution chain and improved community wellbeing from
  reformed industrial operation are not to be passed lightly even extractive industries can be a power for good  if they
  refocus on enhancing the community and ecosystem services as keenly as they do on growing their profits

  draw a triple bottom line not a red line

  at denkstatt we dont just provide established offtheshelf consulting services like waste studies and carbon or wa
  ter footprints  we try to integrate having in mind the net impact of a product or industry project we help our clients
  calculate the sustainable return on their investment new lifecycle assessment and ecosystem serviceoriented ap
  proaches are stateoftheart stuff for industry leaders but soon they will become a yardstick for the pack we want
  these solutions to reach all sectors  from energyhungry ict firms to traditional runofthemill textile workshops
  the promise of sustainable leadership must depend on ones will and commitment not on the size or techlevel of
  ones enterprise

  the path from profit goods to merit goods is a long one

  do we think some industries contribute less than others to the goals of sustainable development yes we do elec
  tricity from coal is more destructive than electricity from wind farms do we think most industries can contribute
  more certainly we do biofuels can achieve a great deal if they use nonfood waste or algae inputs

  are there companies we would not work with  yes they are those who sacrifice their own integrity or the merit of
  their product for profit and those whose product has no merit at all

                       ful knowledge management practices in the group




  knowledge is perceived as the main asset of a
  consulting company what is the perception in
  denkstatt group
  the key to success for our company is to maintain the knowledge
  of our consultants at the stateoftheart it is a huge chal
  lenge considering the rapid change in markets technologies
  society needs a recent study shows that todays knowledge will
  not be enough to cope with the job requirements in 5 years time

  5 years sounds discouraging as it requires
  constant change learning and development
  isnt it
  yes indeed thats exactly the case and i have to tell you i cannot
  imagine it otherwise for example denkstatt group has managed
  its knowledge since more than 20 years in numerous ways
  we have employeespecific training plans international service
                                                                             knowledge
  team meetings induction training weeks for new members of
  denkstatt group and many more elements with the implemen

                                                                            management
  late all our activities in one big picture thus being able to focus
  our activities even more                                                     creates
  the need of knowledge management is alarm
  ing where did you start from
                                                                                 shared
  asking ourselves what knowledge management actually con
  tributes to the success of our company and our stakeholders
                                                                                  value
  we discovered that there are mainly four areas on which our
  shared value rests

       knowledge management mission

    actively linking the knowledge of denkstatt group and us
     ing it to find creative solutions

    rapid generation and market penetration of innovations
     and services

  we developed a set of activities which support and foster the intellectual capital  human relationship and struc
  ture capital  of denkstatt group

                    embedding knowledge management in the organisational context




    human capital

  i see it is interesting to explain your management approach
  lets start with human capital
  in denkstatt we aim at having competent value driven people that learn evolve and innovate a multidisciplinary
  team with recognized experts it is an ambitious goal but its realistic in 2012 we had an average of 86 training days
  per fte in 2013  62 training days on a group level for us the most important thing is to learn on the fly

                                            training days fte per year




                                                                                                         full time equivalent
                                                                                                         no data available



  what do you mean                        the real change happens when we work on projects and when we share the
                                          experience for example in austria bulgaria and romania we introduced in
  by learning on the fly                 ternal knowledge exchange sessions sharing is caring learnt lessons best
                                          practices and inspiring sustainability ideas have been shared we aim at 2014
                                          and after to increase the scope as we are convinced that feedback is the best
                                          trainer for professional and personal development

                                                                                                                           15

  the practicality of your approach is very interesting what other useful methods do
  you use to manage the human capital part of the knowledge management
  every new employee is registered for an approximately weeklong induction training in vienna to get to know our
  fields of work the denkstatt vision and mission to learn the skills and methods to meet and greet new colleagues
  and last but not least to have lots of fun

       participants of international induction
                 training per year




  induction training for almost a week is
  a serious investment on your behalf
  indeed it is in order to take first you need to give it is
  the right thing to give trust and opportunity to newly
  hired staff people love it and we see the results in our
  work as integration takes much less time

  tell us more about the profile of your
  colleagues
  we speak 21 languages with an average of 33 different
  languages per person including chinese greek 91
  of our people have at least a bachelors degree with
  84 having obtained a masters degree or equivalent
  combined with an average professional experience of
  134 years per consultant denkstatt group has a strong
  basis of human capital

  an average of mоre than 13 years of
  professional experience by consult
  ants is a trustbuilding factor how do
  your partners perceive it
  we are often invited to present our point of view on pub
  lic events because our expertise is wellknown many
  colleagues are lecturers at universities also many are
  speakers at conferences radio broadcasts or televi
  sion in the last two years roughly 20 consultants were
  speakers because they are recognized as experts on a
  specific topic

                                                           denkstatt romania promoted the concept of green economy in romania
                                                           and celebrated the companys 5 years anniversary




  is that all that you do in the human capital part of the knowledge management
  nope there is more in order to spend some quality time with our colleagues we introduced in 2014 our yearly
  international spring party for this event all denkstatt people are invited to come to vienna and have a full day of
  workshops and presentations in 2014 focus was on knowledge management and sustainability reporting effective
  working atmosphere depends on friendly and respectful relationships which are built in nonformal setting there
  fore we had cooking activities in the evening where mixed teams provided traditional dishes from every country



  that i am sure was fun it is interesting that
  many companies neglect the effect of nonfor
  mal settings and focus only on working rules
  and fast results and you are trying to do both
  how do you manage
  we consciously work on embedding our culture and beliefs in the
  everyday work for example a special culture team meets regu
  larly in austria and supports the positive working atmosphere such
  an atmosphere is a must for successful knowledge management as
  it is widely known that knowledge management is not about tech
  nology it is about people and processes at the same time we have
  process for tracking time and utilization




                                                                                                                               17

    structure capital

  all key stakeholder groups expects you to provide high quality services i see in
  2012 and 2013 europe was still suffering from the consequences of the crisis which
  diminishes the choices for selecting work or projects many consulting companies
  exited the business or decreased their activities at the same time you invest time
  in knowledge management development

  it is inevitable we believe that a company does not exist only to make money
  it is one part of the story we exist to drive the change to a sustainable society
  even though some of our offices were struggling in the difficult financial situ
  ation in 2012 we appointed a group organisation development manager to
  coordinate the group activities in knowledge and people management in 2013
  we launched the it system for knowledge management based on microsoft
  sharepoint  the latest major addition to our structure capital the launch of
  this online platform marks a huge milestone in our knowledge management
  activities we believe this will speed up the effective transfer and exchange of
  our knowhow now we have relevant project data of more than 1800 success
  fully completed reference projects available within seconds people discuss
  sales opportunities on it as international sales activities are posted online
  while interested managers or sales experts are instantly notified and invited
  to participate the spaces   another major feature of our online platform
   enables our people to improve their collaboration on an international level
  extensive option to set up permission rights ensures the safety of our clients
  data we are very strict on this matter in none of our offices we dont have
  complaints regarding breaches of customer privacy and losses of data

  both in 2012 and 2013 we had 2 community practice meetings where ex
  perts gather to exchange best practices and to learn new working methods
  and tools of denkstatt

  there are also numerous video and teleconference meetings of our consult
  ants to exchange knowhow

    output and impact

  that is quite a massive effort in knowledge management activities denkstatt in
  vests significant amount of time and money to do the right thing what are the out
  puts and impacts of it do you think it is worthwhile

  we believe so we have identified our priorities and                      graph projects in period
  actions in the knowledge management together with
  smart indicators to measure our progress we measure
  the impact of our projects where actually we want to
  see the impact of our activities until 2012 we collected
  data for our internal sustainability index that moni
  tors the outcome of the environmental economic and
  social dimension of our services in 2013 we started a
  process to review our sustainability index methodology
  therefore currently it is not used by the offices

  in 2013 we have been working on 822 projects on a
  group level with net project revenue of eur 37 mio

  by enabling our people to foster and share their knowl
  edge we are confident that denkstatt will maintain and
  extend its position in central and eastern europe and
  ultimately play its part in creating a truly sustainable
  society

denkstatt environmental performance


       the story
       denkstatt as a customer  our supply chain
       denkstatt has a short supply chain that can be characterised with the purchasing of products and services we
       use office supplies water electricity heating paper coffee tea etc spend on travelling flight train tickets
       car rental and administrative services banking external accounting it support etc hire external consult
       ants and venues for project related events we seek suppliers that will meet our requirements at a competitive
       price and will deliver a difference to us as customers this is a reason to select one supplier over the other
       when there is such an opportunity all our offices are rented which leaves us with a limited or no choice on the
       type of main resources we consume eg only austrian office buys exclusively green electricity although pro
       curement practices among the offices vary we share common ground on officespecific criteria such as locally
       sourced and ecolabelled products highquality service and good relations with suppliers we emphasise on
       the latter as some of our offices eg hungary tend to move from purchase to rentals when convenient in our
       austrian office there is a more distinct system of supplier selection criteria the main criteria that guide the
       selection process are local origin of the products followed by environmental considerations and finally cost

article how to integrate stakeholders in the business success story


    the idea every company has impacts through careful look
    at the value chain denkstatt identified together with its stake
    holders the most important materiality topics
  business sustainability and longterm profitability depends on organization ability to involve its stakeholders in the
  decisionmaking process sounds logical but for sure it is not an easy task to achieve the key stakeholders of denkstatt
  are our people clients partners shareholders

  at denkstatt we are in regular dialogue with all parties along the value chain
  to effectively understand the priorities and needs of our stakeholders denkstatt uses a mix of various approaches e
  surveys regular meetings memberships formal and nonformal meetings etc denkstatt consultants are in constant
  contact with the stakeholders responding on time to relevant needs and finding mutually beneficial actions there is no
  structured process but there is a visible benefit from denkstatt activities in stakeholder engagement g418
                                                                                                          g426

  our materiality approach

  satisfying all demands is rather impossible addressing only shareholders needs is a path to failure during our inter
  actions with clients partners denkstatt people one thing is quite clear materiality topics must be linked to business
  value thus our starting point is the value chain g425

  for the purpose of preparing this report our employees across                                            denkstatt value
  all locations were invited to participate in an esurvey to cap                                                   chain
  ture any changes in the material topics over the report
  ing period following the g4 guidelines a broad list of
  relevant topics was provided topics came out as a
  result from the value chain analysis and were both
  related to internal and external processes people
  shared their opinion as well as their estimates
  about stakeholder opinion in defining our ma
  terial topics consultation and meetings with
  internal and external stakeholders were held
  based on all data collected through various
  channels the denkstatt internal sustainabili
  ty team plotted the issues across value chain
  to ensure that we have a reasonable and bal
  anced mix of topics showing both our negative
  and positive impacts we discussed the result
  ing impacts from each issue who is influenced
  and what is the relevance for the reporting peri
  od the final material topics were subject of eval
  uation by our management the hottest issue with
  most significant impact on our stakeholders is knowl
  edge all aspects considered as material are reported
  in detail supported by disclosure of management ap
  proach and appropriate qualitative and quantative indicators

                    reason 2
                    environment is the first building block of sustainability recognized by society

                    concerns for the environmental impact of business activities arouse in the 20th century with
                    the evidence of chemical pollution environmentally significant industrial accidents opposition
                    of indigenous peoples to land destruction association of human activities with global problems

                    motivate the employees

                    taking the responsibility to manage our environmental aspects proves a successful way to
                    involve the whole team around a common goal to provide space for practice and learning to
                    show respect to the environment and thus get the employees committed if it is completely
                    safe our employees try alternative transportation such as going by bike to work and business
                    meetings

                    reason 5
                    earn respect
                    differentiation as a green business brings a competitive advantage customers and partners
                    recognize our efforts to measure how much energy we consume how much water we use what
                    quantities and type of waste we produce how we treat it and what measures we implement to
                    reduce these impacts we serve as a role model when customers are looking for solutions for
                    their own environmental impacts

article sustainability and fun transformation of the corporate world


    the idea sustainability is a way of development seen as un
    evitable and vital by many top executives ceos and managing
    directors like the cost savings that result from sustainability
    programs because they are immediately measurable
  however there are bottom line benefits that are more subtle but not less profound for denkstatt those aspects
  are especially important

  meaningful work                      in the meantime many journals promote the idea of worklife imbalance
                                       in addition to that consultancy is a very challenging job however we still
                                       believe that a lifebalance in our society is feasible people struggle to
                                       achieve that balance between working long hours to accomplish important
                                       work and having enough time and energy for life outside of work we stress
                                       this topic especially because by having a rewarding meaningful job very
                                       often hard work is perceived differently the topics denkstatt employees
                                       are covering within its projects are in line with our employees personal
                                       believes and values thus we do not see it as work but more as a central
                                       part of their lives




  having fun at work                   having fun at work isnt always appropriate and it certainly doesnt appeal
                                       to everyones work style but the opportunity to forge real relationships at
                                       work can be truly meaningful and make employees genuinely look forward
                                       to the start of every workday we are happy to say that also our managers
                                       are equally willing to share this fun  which gives us a wonderful opportu
                                       nity to capture this nonfinancial reward




  enjoy the interaction                we are convinced that humor and personality in our projects and thus our
                                       client service interactions are crucial not because humor can be one of
                                       the most effective ways to diffuse awkward or problematic situations it is
                                       more about that we believe it is one of our most outstanding values within
                                       the entire organization




  funny and creativity                 at denkstatt we are striving to create a funny exciting dynamic workplace

                                                                   danube  east of vienna project
  vicious criticism from some ngos and local stakeholders backed by the negative stance of austrian media cast a shad
  ow on the project of via donau that is responsible for the maintenance and development of the danube waterway this
  situation required a completely new approach and an ambitious plan to involve civil society in both monitoring and man
  aging the project through a stakeholder panel denkstatt was asked to define a process and facilitate further measures
  a stakeholder panel called akteursforum stakeholder forum was established to resume work at the danube the
  forum consists of ten delegates with representatives from the business and navigation sectors from environmen
  tal and angling ngos from the danube floodplain national park and from the international commission for the
  protection of the danube river these delegates are supported by a panel of experts who act as an advisory board
  forum meetings are public and observers are encouraged by denkstatt to share their views the forum can give
  recommendations to the project owner or ask for information and make formal enquiries the work of the forum is
  totally transparent to the public minutes of the meetings are provided for further reading on the projects website
  with the help of denkstatt tailoring the stakeholder communication as well as the entire process the cli
  ent could put its role as project owner in the background and the companys representatives attend meet
  ings only as observers a cause that is essential for an impartial access where everybody should be heard
  one point is very clear the forums goal is not to ensure smooth implementation of the project but rather to en
  dorse dialogue and partnership including criticism a sensitive process that requires sensitive partners for sure
  meanwhile international corporations and river commissions have expressed their interest in the forum and in the
  work of denkstatt we are very excited about this says josef semrad of via donaus environmental department for
  years we have dealt with so much criticism  it is good to see appreciation and a friendly interest in our work now
