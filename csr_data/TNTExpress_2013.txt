i letter to stakeholders
dear stakeholders

at the beginning of 2012 we announced our building on strengths strategy the strategy carved out a
path for success with europe at the core it also included some clear choices aimed at limiting tnt
express exposure to emerging domestic markets and fixed air assets

full execution of our strategy was impacted by the offer from ups the supervisory and executive
boards unanimously supported the merger which would have brought substantial benefits this
assessment was shared by our stakeholders who gave us clear support a large number of competition
authorities also gave their approval unfortunately the european commission formally prohibited the
merger on 30 january 2013 and we were ultimately unable to complete the transaction

though disappointing the prohibition decision did not unbalance us we have a resilient market
position which we continued to expand in 2012 we grew our customer portfolio with customer
appreciation scores higher than ever this was not only based on excellent operational performance but
also on the strength of our customer proposition a wide range of integrated services flexibility
reliability expertise worldwide presence and control and visibility over the customers supply chain we
also have committed employees employee engagement improved with record high 83 participation in
our engagement survey and a higher overall engagement score

we made progress in the execution of our strategy for example we successfully reduced
intercontinental air capacity exposure through blockedspace agreements we also gained ground on
our cost reduction programmes achieving indirect cost savings of 50 million and implementing nearly
twothirds of the 100 million 2012 to 2013 fixed cost savings programme

our financial performance however did not meet expectations difficult macroeconomic conditions in
europe coupled with continued pressure on yield as a result of continuing price pressure and the
switch to lowerpriced economy products had a negative impact these effects were only partially
mitigated by cost reductions and while the losses in our brazilian operations were reduced we did not
realise the level of improvements we had aimed for our asia pacific segment showed very good
progress and generated a positive return on an adjusted basis despite lower asiaeurope demand

we now have a clear challenge for the company improve our financial performance the full
management board with the support of our supervisory board is developing a specific improvement
programme with the existing strategy as the starting point we are in the process of reviewing initiatives
that will accelerate growth in those segments in which we have a differentiating position and that will
significantly increase our cost competitiveness we will present a detailed improvement plan on 25
march 2013

we are confident of success based on our strong market positions and the enormous positive
momentum that exists within the company

in closing i wish to thank our employees for their steadfast pursuit of customer excellence over the past
year

kind regards

bernard bot

subdued performance in europe  mea improved profitability in asia
pacific and americas
in 2012 tnt express experienced a decline in adjusted revenues and adjusted operating income

in europe  mea revenues remained flat despite healthy volume growth as a result of price pressure
and negative product mix effects the decline in yield was only partially offset by cost savings resulting
in lower adjusted results

in asia pacific revenue declined due to lower asiaeurope demand targeted restructuring of large
international accounts reductions in china domestic hoau less than truck load ltl volumes and
the exit of the domestic businesses in india india domestic however yield improvements in our
domestic activities and solid cost containment secured a strong improvement in adjusted operating
income

in brazil the adjusted revenue increase was the net result of a modest decline in volumes and solid
yield improvements though the targeted improvements were not realised adjusted operating income
improved

control of investments and working capital ensured a positive cash flow before financing and dividends
at the end of 2012 net cash improved to 139 million in comparison to net debt of 7 million at the end
of 2011 with available cash and cash equivalents of 401 million and an undrawn facility of 570
million tnt express financial position is sound as reflected in its bbb stable and baa2 negative
credit ratings

tnt express proposes to compensate the loss out of the distributable part of the shareholders equity
and to pay a proforma dividend relating to the full year 2012 adjusted results of 003 per share out of
the distributable part of the shareholders equity the dividend is to be received in stock or in cash the
proposed dividend represents a payout of 39 of normalised net income profit attributable to equity
holders of the parent adjusted for significant oneoff and exceptional items over the full year 2012

ups offer
on 19 march 2012 united parcel service inc ups and tnt express reached an agreement on a
recommended allcash offer by ups of 950 per ordinary share for tnt express the executive board
and supervisory board of tnt express unanimously supported the offer believing the merger was
feasible and beneficial to all stakeholders in the process of obtaining approval from the european
commission ec the ec identified competitive concerns ups in cooperation with tnt express
offered remedies to overcome these concerns the ec did not consider these remedies to be sufficient
resulting in its decision to prohibit the merger on 30 january 2013 anticipating this decision ups
informed tnt express it would no longer pursue the transaction and confirmed payment of the agreed
200 million termination fee to tnt express consequently on 14 january 2013 tnt express
announced that it would focus on the execution of its standalone strategy tnt express received
payment of the termination fee on 13 february 2013

net financial expense decreased by 11 million mainly due to a 5 million decline in fair value hedges
and net foreign exchange losses and 7 million lower interest on foreign currency hedges the
decrease in interest on foreign currency hedges was caused by lower interest rate differentials between
currencies in foreign exchange forward contracts mainly in eurusd

tax of 47 million 2011 172 the current tax expense was 92 million 2011 108 the difference
between the total income taxes in the income statement and the current tax expense is due to
temporary differences these temporary differences are recognised as deferred tax assets or deferred
tax liabilities refer to chapter 5 for more information the increase in total income tax expense is mainly
due to derecognition of previously recognised deferred taxes

the effective income tax rate differs significantly from the average statutory income tax rate of the
countries in which tnt express operates mainly a result of nondeductible impairments the
derecognition of previously recognised deferred tax assets and current year losses for which no
deferred tax assets could be recognised due to uncertainty regarding the recoverability of such assets

market position

nextdaybyroad solutions
with its dense domestic and intraeuropean air and road networks tnt express can seamlessly
operate across geographical borders to serve europe as one market in 2012 tnt express introduced
new nextdaybyroad linehauls the nextdaybyroad crossborder linehauls currently connect 23
countries on a daily basis with 52 unique nextday border crossings the growth in crossborder
volumes enables tnt express to increase its market share by road in both intraeuropean express as
well as intraeuropean economy this allows the company to refocus its air network on longestdistance
and highestvalue shipments in line with this development new rate cards were introduced that are
based on zones that cover multiple countries rather than distinguishing between domestic and
international flows

intercontinental with relatively greater focus on express and parcel products tnt express attracts and
retains smes by delivering consistently high service levels and an integrated marketing and sales
customer contact strategy resulting in higher than average margins in 2012 marketing initiatives
targeted at this segment generated a significant number of new customers

connect europe with the rest of the world
tnt express objective is to reduce its exposure to fixed intercontinental capacity while enhancing its
global service coverage through partnerships with leading airlines this was achieved in 2012 as tnt
express entered into cooperation agreements with multiple leading airlines covering predominantly tnt
express routes to and from asia pacific and north and south america

in april emirates skycargo placed its airline code and used space on tnt airways boeing 777
freighter flights on the new yorkliège and hong kongdubailiège routes in december tnt express
entered into blockedspace agreements with other providers and expanded its air cargo sales activities

given the intended merger with ups marketing of tnt airways boeing 747 freighters was suspended
this is being reviewed as part of the 2013 strategy update

implement structural cost efficiencies
in 2012 tnt express completed its targeted 50 million indirect cost reduction programme savings
were realised in head office costs and in the costs of administrative and support activities in the rest of
the company in addition tnt express launched a programme to reduce fixed costs by 150 million by
the end of 2013 following the announcement of the merger with ups the timing of certain longterm
projects was temporarily adjusted reducing the savings target to around 100 million by the end of
2013 consisting mainly of savings in local operations and infrastructure nearly twothirds of the overall
targeted savings have been realised from this programme in 2012

service levels

adjusted revenues increased by 02 despite a challenging economic environment benelux eastern
europe france and the middle east showed the strongest volume growth average consignments per
day and average kilogrammes per day grew by 57 and 12 respectively reflecting tnt express
strong position in europe weight per consignment declined as a result of lower market trading activity
and an increase in b2c volumes volumes in all product categories increased with the highest growth in
international economy as a result of the change in product mix air network volumes decreased while
road network volumes increased

revenue per consignment rpc and revenue per kilogramme rpk decreased by 49 and 08
respectively as a result of ongoing price pressure and product and customer mix effects these
declines had a significant impact on the development of the segments operating income

during the year yield improvement measures were taken in all european countries a range of
marketing and sales initiatives including targeted marketing campaigns and internal sales competitions
were implemented a differentiated pricing approach launched in 2011 was deployed throughout tnt
express to support the acquisition development and retention of smes this approach has proven
successful and contributed to overall improved performance by generating a higher level of new
customers at attractive margins

service quality measured by ontime delivery was in line with 2011 at 95 for the year

to counter cost inflation and lower yields tnt express implemented various efficiency and productivity
initiatives these initiatives targeted savings through subcontractor and linehaul productivity
improvements supplier tariff optimisation lower procurement costs and application of lean
methodology to operational processes

in april 2012 tnt express was awarded the 2012 franz edelman award for its global optimisation
go programme which uses advanced operations research to optimise tnt express transport
network the awarded go programme covers multiple aspects of tnt express operations including
location planning optimal truck routing fleet management and staff scheduling

during 2012 the available capacity in european air network was lowered by 9 through the sale of
three british aerospace 146 freighters and the reduction of leased thirdparty aircraft this capacity
reduction follows lower air volumes volumes in the european road network increased the road
network continued to perform strongly both in terms of unit costs and operational service quality

higher volumes and cost control did not offset the significant negative impact of lower rpc and rpk on

adjusted revenues declined 10 as a consequence of lower volumes

lower volumes were driven by reduced asiaeurope demand and targeted customer and service
optimisation initiatives key account volumes from china to europe fell through a combination of lower
demand and actions taken to improve revenue quality domestic volumes in india significantly declined
following the discontinuation of the domestic road and air businesses domestic volumes in china fell
with highervolume ltl services substituted by higherpriced daydefinite services the latter impact is
especially significant as china domestic accounts for approximately 65 of all kilogrammes transported
in asia pacific daydefinite grew by more than 40 yearonyear and represented at yearend over
35 of revenues 2011 30 well on track to realise the projected 40 of revenues in 2013

during 2012 tnt express operated four freighters to and from asia two boeing 747 freighters serving
chongqing shanghai and singapore and two boeing 777 freighters serving hong kong to limit
exposure to volatile and weaker asia demand tnt express entered into codeshare and blockedspace
agreements which resulted in lower costs for asia pacific revenue related to these air cargo sales is
recognised in the europe  mea segment

revenue quality improved as a result of the optimisation of the business portfolio rpc declined by
16 while rpk increased by 135 the lower rpc is due to the changed business mix

adjusted operating income improved yearonyear by 42 million because of a significant reduction in
losses in china the exit of india domestic and strong performances in southeast asia and australia

us fashion customer

the resultant decline in other networks adjusted operating income was wholly related to tnt innight
tnt innight was impacted by the general decline in the automotive industry particularly in the
transportation of spare parts the relatively mild winter experienced in the first quarter of 2012 in central
europe also resulted in a reduction in the demand for spare parts compared to the two preceding years

that subcontractors have a crucial impact on service levels and customer satisfaction they are an
essential part of tnt express assetlight business model and are frequently in contact with customers
managing this relationship to maximise their operational and environmental performance is an important
item on tnt express sustainability agenda an innovative subcontractor management programme was
launched in 2012 to continue to build mutually valuable partnerships and to decrease subcontractors
co2 footprints subcontractors can benefit from these partnerships and obtain practical solutions and
tools like the fleet safety guide the guide was developed by fleet forum on behalf of the united
nations environment programme and consists of a stepbystep approach for the development of clean
fleet strategies

system co2 scheme

the system co2 service portfolio focuses on two aspects
 providing customers with accurate and reliable reports on the co2 emissions caused by the
    transportation of their consignments co2 can be reported for already transported consignments or
    predicted for future business the reporting method follows internationally recognised guidelines
    and standards
 offering alternatives to reduce the impact of co2 emissions either by working with customers to

upstream and downstream activities this would only serve to assist tnt express in identifying key
improvement areas in the other categories and engaging with partners in the value chain to reduce the
overall impact

subcontractor management
subcontractors are an integral part of tnt express service offering and are often in direct contact with
customers tnt express is therefore committed to develop and maintain a supportive and appropriate
management framework to build a healthy relationship with them this includes policies and tools to

foundations of tnt express corporate governance
the executive board is committed to a high standard of corporate governance information and
disclosure in line with the current dutch corporate governance code and regulatory requirements the
executive boards compliance statements relative to the dutch corporate governance code and the
dutch financial markets supervision act can be found on page 11 the full text of the code can be
viewed on tnts corporate website wwwtntcomcorporate

internal control over financial reporting
the executive board uses the positive elements of former obligations under the sarbanesoxley act in
establishing the companys governance and internal controls over financial reporting icfr
furthermore the executive board has chosen to expand the scope of the internal controls over financial
reporting framework beyond the minimum requirements that would have been mandatory according to
the sarbanesoxley act to include certain smaller entities and most entities acquired in the past few
years

tnt express specific approach to internal control over financial reporting continues to be generally
based on section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the associated guidance to management
issued by the united states securities and exchange commission in may 2007 in addition the
approach is based on the principles outlined in the auditing standards as 2 and takes into account
certain elements of the as 5 as promulgated by the public companies accounting oversight board
pcaob however tnt express approach to internal control over financial reporting does not imply
an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of tnt express internal control and risk
management processes over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act nor is
there an assessment by tnt express external auditor to that effect

throughout 2012 tnt express documented and evaluated the design of internal controls over financial
reporting in addition tnt express continued a comprehensive programme of testing the operational
effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting further initiatives on entity level controls
were undertaken including integrity awareness and training refer to the integrity section below and
reinforcement of policies and procedures in 2012 the executive board engaged the external auditor to
perform specific agreedupon procedures on the internal control over financial reporting process in all
entities included in the scope of the icfr programme the executive board believes that this approach
develops the discipline needed to maintain and embed internal control over financial reporting across
the company the findings of the external auditor are reported to the executive board and the audit
committee of the supervisory board

in 2012 the executive board initiated the expansion of the scope and discipline of the icfr approach to
nonfinancial reporting areas in commercial and operational functions

dutch corporate governance code
the corporate governance structure of tnt express is based on the requirements of the dutch civil
code its articles of association internal procedures and the rules and regulations applicable to
companies listed on the nyse euronext stock exchange tnt express aims to enhance and improve its
corporate governance standards in accordance with applicable law and regulations with the
implementation of the dutch corporate governance code being the most notable generally tnt
express applies the best practice provisions set out in the dutch corporate governance code an
explanation is given below for those instances in which tnt express does not fully comply with the best
practice provisions of the dutch corporate governance code

best practice provision ii28
this provision includes a stipulation that the remuneration of a member of the board of management in
the event of dismissal may not exceed one years salary the fixed remuneration component at tnt
express severance payments other than related to a change of control for members of the executive
board are one years base salary severance payments in case of a change of control equal the sum of
the last annual base salary and pension contribution plus the average bonus received over the past
three years multiplied by two tnt express is of the opinion that such payment is realistic taking into
account the special position of members of the executive board in a change of control situation also in
such an event the supervisory board may decide that the performance shares vest in whole or in part

best practice provision iv11
this provision stipulates that a companys general meeting may pass a resolution to set aside the
binding nature of a nomination for the appointment of a member of the board of management or of the
supervisory board andor a resolution to remove a member of the board of management or of the
supervisory board by an absolute majority of the votes cast which majority may be required to represent
a proportion of the issued capital which proportion may not exceed onethird if this proportion of the
capital is not represented at the meeting but an absolute majority is in favour of any such resolution a
new meeting may be convened at which the resolution may be passed by an absolute majority of the
votes cast regardless of the proportion of the capital represented at the meeting

the foundation
stichting continuïteit tnt express the foundation has its official seat in amsterdam the netherlands
with its address at taurusavenue 111 2132 ls hoofddorp the netherlands the objects of the

stakeholders involved these objects include protecting tnt express as much as possible from
influences that are contrary to those interests and could jeopardise the continuity independence or
identity of those interests the foundation must endeavour to achieve these objects by acquiring and
holding preference shares and by exercising the rights attached to those preference shares the objects
of the foundation do not entail the sale or encumbrance or other disposal of shares with the exception
of the sale to tnt express or to another company assigned by and affiliated in a group with it as well
as the assistance in the repayment or withdrawal of preference shares

to this end tnt express has granted a call option to the foundation the foundation will have the right
to exercise the call option at any time either wholly or partly when exercising the call option the
foundation is entitled to subscribe for preference shares consisting of the right to repeatedly subscribe
for preference shares up to a maximum corresponding with one hundred per cent 100 of the issued
share capital in the form of ordinary shares as outstanding immediately prior to the exercise of the
subscribed rights less one preference share and minus any shares already held by the foundation

reasons for which the foundation may exercise the call option include
 to prevent slow down or otherwise complicate an unsolicited takeover bid for and an unsolicited
   acquisition of ordinary shares by means of an acquisition at the stock market or otherwise
 to prevent and countervail concentration of voting rights in the general meeting and
 to resist unwanted influence by and pressure from shareholders to amend the strategy of tnt
   express

and with respect to the foregoing to give tnt express the opportunity to consider and to explore
possible alternatives and if required to work these out and to implement them in the event an actual or
threatening concentration of voting rights arises among the shareholders which according to the
provisional judgement of the executive board and the supervisory board and the board of the
foundation is considered to be unsolicited and not in the interest of tnt express and its enterprise
and to enable tnt express to do so by temporarily neutralising such concentration of voting rights

as from six months after the issuance of the preference shares to the foundation the foundation may
require tnt express to convene a general meeting to propose cancellation of the preference shares
against repayment of the paid amount if preference shares are issued tnt express must convene a
general meeting to be held not later than 12 months after the date on which the preference shares
were issued for the first time or 60 days after the foundation has demanded the cancellation of its




                                                                                                          51

preference shares the agenda for that general meeting must include a proposal for a resolution
relating to the repurchase or cancellation of the preference shares

tnt express has granted to the foundation the right to file an application for an inquiry into the policy
and the course of events of tnt express with the enterprise chamber of the amsterdam court of
appeal ondernemingskamer tnt express believes that this may be a useful option inter alia in the
period before the issuance of preference shares as it does not cause a dilution of the rights of other
shareholders

the members of the board of the foundation are mr bouw chairman mr tiemstra and ms tonkens
gerkema all members of the board of the foundation are independent from tnt express this means
that the foundation is an independent legal entity in the sense referred to in section 571 paragraph 1

remuneration policy 2012 variable income

general
to support tnt express ambitions the variable income policy consists of the following instruments
 shortterm incentive in cash
 voluntary bonusmatching plan linked to the shortterm incentive and
 equitybased longterm incentive to ensure alignment with shareholders

the targets of the shortterm and longterm incentives are linked and their relative weighting reflects the
strategy of tnt express to achieve growth in all stakeholder areas

the shortterm and longterm incentive plans for the members of the executive board are fully aligned
with the variable income programmes for senior management the reward under the shortterm
incentive plan the performance share plan and the additional share match under the bonusmatching
plan is dependant on the performance relative to preset financial and nonfinancial targets all targets
and objectives are quantitative

shortterm incentive
in 2012 under the new tnt express remuneration policy the shortterm incentive opportunity was
lowered compared to the 2011 remuneration policy an at target performance is rewarded with 50 of
annual base salary 2011 100 a stretch performance in case of realisation of a stretch ebit target
is rewarded with an additional 25 of annual base salary 2011 no stretch

the focus areas for the 2012 shortterm incentive are
 60 financial targets comprising
     70 ebit
     30 net cash flow from continuing operations

   40 nonfinancial targets equally weighted comprising
     customers client satisfaction
     employees management development and engagement of employees
     sustainability environment and health and safety

results relating to the financial and nonfinancial targets lead independently to a bonus payout

for 2012 the reward of the realised performance is as follows
 performance below the threshold 90 of the at target level no bonus payout
 performance at threshold level 10 of the at target bonus percentage
 performance between threshold and at target level and between at target and stretch level a
    sliding scale will be used
 performance below 95 of the financial targets bonus for the performance on nonfinancial targets
    is halved
 no bonus will be paid out in case the ebit results are negative

a member of the executive board is required to be inservice on 31 december of the relevant year to
qualify for the shortterm incentive scheme

bonusmatching plan
the executive board may on a voluntary basis participate in the bonusmatching plan by investing a
maximum of 50 of the gross payout of the shortterm incentive of the previous year but not more than
25 of their gross annual base salary however the investment in tnt express shares cannot be
more than the net proceeds of the bonus after a threeyear holding period these shares will be
matched on a onetoone basis

in the event that the ebit target is met every year during this threeyear holding period a maximum
additional match will be made on a onetotwo basis resulting in a total award of three matching shares
if the performance is below the ebit target there is no delivery of additional matching shares for that
specific year

the matching of bonus shares occurs under the condition of continued employment and if at least 50
of the bonus shares is retained during the holding period the schedule below describes the vesting
schedule of the general bonusmatching plan and the additional matching related to the annual
performance on the ebit target during the holding period

strategic risks

specific  strategic risks
the express business is cyclical and highly sensitive to fluctuations of trade flows which in
case of an economic downturn could affect tnt express revenue and profitability
the express business is cyclical and highly sensitive to fluctuations of trade flows there is a strong
correlation between trade flows and economic development in case of an economic downturn there is a
risk of a sharp decline in trade volumes such decline of trade volumes could lead to a significant
decrease in volumes offered for transport by tnt express which in turn places pressure on revenue
quality

in reviewing the business environment tnt express has concluded that the economic situation varies
significantly by geography and is increasingly uncertain

changes in customer preferences or shipping patterns could result in a shift by customers from
premium services to economy services or a loss of customers which could affect tnt express
revenue and profitability
driven by economic developments cost rationalisation customers preferences or shipping patterns
could shift from tnt express higherpriced premium services to its slower cheaper economy services
in addition it may also lose customers due to negative economic developments or cost rationalisation

the integration of acquired businesses may involve significant challenges including costs and
could affect tnt express revenue profitability and financial position
in the past tnt express has made a number of acquisitions the integration of these acquired
businesses is not without execution risks these risks are compounded in emerging markets that by
nature contain higher levels of market and execution risks

there is a risk that tnt express might not achieve optimal integration of the acquired company in 2010
and 2011 tnt express incurred loss of revenue and additional costs in relation to its acquisitions in
brazil this example highlights the uncertainty in relation to acquired businesses tnt express may
face additional or new integrationrelated costs pertaining to previously acquired companies

the value of the investment in an acquired company may decrease significantly and may be
permanently impaired

tnt express may sell off some entities or exit certain businesses or markets which could result
in additional costs related to closure of operations business disruption impairment of goodwill
or other contractual liabilities and could therefore affect tnt express revenue profitability and
financial position
tnt express may either sell off or fully or partially exit certain activities businesses or markets due to
changes in strategic focus unattractive market conditions aggressive competitor pricing policies
regulatory requirements or protectionist behaviour by governments a full or partial exit could affect tnt
express revenue profitability and financial position because of losses on disposal additional costs from
the closure of operations business disruption the impairment of goodwill and other contractual
liabilities including liabilities that could arise as a result of agreements that are customary in case of a
partial sale

measures taken to reduce costs including employee redundancies may be delayed andor may
not achieve the intended results and could affect tnt express revenue and profitability
further restructuring measures will be taken in 2013 and affect all company entities such cost saving
targets and initiatives are based on assumptions and expectations that may not be realised
restructuring of operations and other cost reducing measures may not achieve the results intended in
addition restructuring costs and other costs and charges are based on expectations and forecasts if
these are not realised tnt express may incur additional restructuring costs deviations from forecast
savings and restructuring costs could affect tnt express profitability

when restructuring actions are taken the engagement level of our employees might decrease and lead
to an increase in voluntary turnover the disruption because of a restructuring process cannot be
underestimated

intensifying competition in the cep market may put downward pressure on volumes and prices
and could affect tnt express revenue and profitability
tnt express competes with many companies and provides services on a local regional european and
global level its competitors include express companies logistics service providers freight forwarders
and air or road couriers intensified competition through targeted aggressive actions by competitors




                                                                                                          62

                                                                                                 governance
                                                                                                  chapter 4



may put downward pressure on volumes and prices this may force down volumes and prices for tnt
express services

a public offer for the shares of tnt express could result in loss of customers supplier
contracts partnership divestment or investment opportunities and employees and could
distract management in the execution of the companys strategy it could also delay the
implementation of restructuring projects this could affect tnt express revenue profitability
and service quality
a public bid for tnt express could have an impact on tnt express ability to execute its strategy
attract and retain customers enter into supplier contracts and conclude partnership investment or
divestment opportunities due to uncertainty employees could also decide to leave tnt express due to
this uncertainty and management could be distracted from the daytoday management of the company
certain restructuring or other projects could also be affected

inherent  strategic risks
tnt express derives a significant portion of its revenue from its international operations and is
subject to the risks of conducting operations in emerging markets a downturn in these markets
could affect tnt express revenue profitability and financial position
as tnt express has significant international operations it is exposed to changing economic political
and social developments beyond its control emerging markets are typically more volatile than mature
markets and any downturn in these markets is typically more pronounced than those in the developed
world

the loss of critical employees and the inability to attract and retain talent could have an adverse
effect on tnt express business
successful execution of tnt express strategy is not possible without talented and engaged employees
that have the right skills and experience employees are essential in our operations and service to
customers tnt express plans may not be achieved if it fails to attract and retain essential employees
tnt express is committed to attracting developing and engaging key employees

operational risks

specific  operational risks
tnt express may not accurately forecast future infrastructure requirements which could result
in excess or insufficient capacity and affect its profitability
tnt express must make ongoing investments in infrastructure such as aircraft vehicles and depots
infrastructure investments are based on forecasts of future capacity requirements forecasts for future
requirements might not be accurate and may result in a mismatch between investment and actual
requirements

if tnt express underestimates its future capacity requirements customer needs might not be met and
it could lose business market share revenue and profits if tnt express overestimates future needs it
may experience costly excess capacity the impact of under or overestimation of future capacity
requirements is particularly significant in regards to major longterm investments such as hubs major
depots and aircraft

the loss of key suppliers and subcontractors or an inability to engage suitable suppliers or
subcontractors could have a significant impact on tnt express operations and thereby affect
its revenue and profitability
tnt express business model depends upon the extensive use of key suppliers and subcontractors for
instance tnt express uses many commercial aircraft as part of its global network operations the
insolvency bankruptcy or unavailability of a key supplier or subcontractor could affect tnt express
operations and thereby affect its revenue and profitability

tnt express depends on a number of infrastructure facilities for which it has limited or no
comparable backup facilities in addition the business depends on the availability and security
of a bespoke it infrastructure in the event of operational disruptions at one or more of these
facilities andor an it failure the revenue and profitability of tnt express could be affected
a portion of tnt express infrastructure is concentrated in key locations an example of this is its air
express hub in liège belgium the operation of tnt express facilities is prone to a number of risks
including power failures the breakdown failure or substandard performance of equipment the
possibility of work stoppages or civil unrest natural disasters catastrophic incidents such as aircraft
crashes fires and explosions and normal hazards associated with operating a complex infrastructure

if there were to be a significant interruption of operations at one or more of tnt express key facilities
and operations could not be transferred or could only be transferred at very high costs to other locations




                                                                                                        63

                                                                                                    governance
                                                                                                     chapter 4



tnt express might not be able to meet its contractual obligations incur liabilities and revenue and
profitability could be affected

in addition tnt express operations administration and customer facing services depend on an it
infrastructure for their daytoday operation if one or more elements of tnt express it infrastructure
fails and backup facilities do not operate successfully it may impact tnt express operation and affect
its revenue and profitability

tnt express reputation as well as its profitability could be affected by fatalities as a result of
road traffic accidents air crashes incidents resulting from the transport of hazardous materials
and loss of confidential consignments
tnt express operates a large fleet of vehicles and drivers could be involved in accidents that result in
fatalities tnt express has recorded road traffic accidents over the years due to acquisitions in
emerging markets and adverse weather conditions in addition tnt express transports hazardous
materials for a number of customers in the automotive biomedical and chemical industries the
hazardous consignments include airbags batteries paint blood samples medical substances dry ice
and chemicals it may also transport hazardous or dangerous goods without notification from customers
of the nature of the goods transported incidents involving these materials could result from a variety of
causes including sabotage terrorism accidents or the improper packaging or handling of the materials
tnt express faces a number of risks by transporting these materials such as personal injury or loss of
life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage

tnt express also transports confidential and sensitive consignments on behalf of some of its
customers tnt express might not be aware of the confidential and sensitive nature of these
consignments and customers may choose to enter consignments into its network without registering the
consignment with the result that they cannot be tracked and traced

if the number of fatal accidents is not reduced or a significant incident occurred involving the handling of
hazardous materials or if confidential consignments were misplaced or lost tnt express operations
could be disrupted and the company could be subject to a wide range of additional measures or
restrictions imposed on it by local or government authorities as well as potentially large civil and criminal
liabilities a significant incident particularly a wellpublicised incident involving potential or actual harm
to members of the public could damage tnt express reputation

inability to secure effective flight slot times and appropriate licences may result in significant
changes to tnt express operations and could limit its flexibility in operating its business and
affect its revenue and profitability
tnt express operates various types of aircraft throughout europe and between europe and the united
states and asia some of the countries in which tnt express operates have adopted or proposed
regulations that impose nighttime takeoff and landing restrictions aircraft capacity limitations and
similar measures to address the concerns of local communities these stakeholders have a strong
influence on the government and aviation authorities that provide slot times and required licences for
example tnt express relies on nighttime operations at its air express hub in liège belgium for a
substantial part of its international express business a potential future curtailment of nighttime takeoffs
and landings at any of tnt express key facilities in liège could affect its operations and the services
that the company can offer to customers

in addition as the provider of timesensitive delivery services tnt express needs to secure adequate
and effective flight slot times from airport coordination or other local authorities in all the countries and
airports in which it operates the limited availability of these slots could have an impact on the efficient
operations of tnt express timesensitive air and road networks and could result in a breach of its
contractual obligations

inherent  operational risks
a terrorist attack and increased antiterrorism requirements could impose substantial additional
security costs on tnt express and thus affect its profitability
escalating concerns about global terrorism and perceived insufficient levels of aviation security have
caused governments and airline operators around the world either to adopt or contemplate adopting
stricter disciplines that will increase operating costs especially for the transportation industry therefore
tnt express makes significant investments in aviation security equipment the enhanced rules and
regulations or other future security requirements for air cargo carriers could have a negative impact on
service quality and impose material additional costs




                                                                                                            64

                                                                                                   governance
                                                                                                    chapter 4



tnt express operations and employees are subject to risks related to natural disasters and
extreme weather events that could affect both revenue and profitability
tnt express operations and employees could potentially be affected by extreme weather events this
could force airports airspace and road networks to close and thereby create significant delays in both
air and road operations

the risk of similar future events is impossible to predict and could affect tnt express revenue and
profitability however contingency plans are in place to bypass impacted locations if and when
required

increases to the prices of fuel and energy may affect tnt express revenue and profitability
tnt express operations depend on air and road transport as a result fuel and energy costs form a
significant part of tnt express cost base ongoing political and social developments in the middle
east or other supply or demand developments could lead to an increase in fuel and energy prices
electricity prices might increase further as a result of more stringent regulation of power utilities under
the eu emissions trading scheme rising fuel and energy prices may affect tnt express prices to
customers and costs

health epidemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases including pandemic influenza
could affect tnt express revenue and profitability
outbreaks of contagious diseases such as h1n1 and sars and other adverse public health
developments could affect tnt express operations and impact tnt express ability to ship
consignments or otherwise impact deliveries of products originating in affected countries as well as
cause temporary closure of offices or other facilities such closures or shipment restrictions could
severely disrupt tnt express operations

tnt express may also be required by regulation andor by stakeholder expectation to setup measures
to ensure continuity of operations in the event of such an outbreak this could increase costs as tnt
express prepares to mitigate such risks

legal and regulatory risks

specific  legal and regulatory risks
changes in the shareholder base of tnt express or in the domicile of tnt airways could impact
tnt express ability to secure and maintain traffic rights in certain countries and the use of
airports which could in turn affect its revenue and profitability
tnt airways nvsa is incorporated in belgium and qualifies as a belgian and eu carrier pan air
lineas aereas sa is incorporated in spain and qualifies as a spanish and eu carrier both entities
operate under the name tnt airways this legal status provides a number of privileges including tnt
express use of liège airport routings and reciprocal traffic rights and trade arrangements changing
the domicile of tnt airways or other changes to its legal structure which result in it not qualifying as a
belgian or spanish or eu carrier may result in tnt airways not being able to use certain airports

changes in tnt express shareholder base which could result in noneu shareholders holding a
majority of the ordinary shares may result in tnt airways losing a number of its privileges

failure by subcontractors to meet obligations for social security and other fiscal requirements
could have a significant impact on tnt express ability to provide services as well as its
reputation and profitability
in some jurisdictions failure by subcontractors to meet obligations for social security and other fiscal
requirements could result in the hiring company becoming liable if tnt express is held liable for its
subcontractors breach of social security or fiscal obligations its profitability could be affected even if
there are no direct financial consequences the reputation of tnt express could be damaged

in addition in some countries subcontractors may file claims against tnt express on the basis that
legal minimum tariffs have not been paid




                                                                                                          65

                                                                                                   chapter 4



inherent  legal and regulatory risks
tnt express operates in many jurisdictions and is confronted with complex legal and regulatory
requirements  especially in emerging markets where the legal systems are in varying stages of
development also partnerships or potential partnerships or acquisitions could result in claims
from partners third parties or stakeholders this creates an uncertain business and investment
environment with potential risks which could affect tnt express revenue profitability and
financial position
tnt express operates globally and is confronted with complex legal and regulatory requirements in
many jurisdictions these include tariffs labour environment and trade barriers limitations on foreign
ownership of assets and share capital taxes on remittances and other payments

in several jurisdictions particularly in emerging markets such as china brazil india russia and the
middle east the legal systems are in varying stages of development this creates an uncertain
business and investment environment with related risks these risks can include the absence of an
independent and experienced judiciary the necessity to use nominee constructs and the possibility that
tnt express may be unable to enforce contracts if any of these risks materialise this might affect tnt
express ability to implement its policies and strategies

tnt express is in the business of transporting goods that are subject to specific restrictions and
regulations a violation could result in fines and administrative sanctions which could affect
revenue and profitability
tnt express provides transportation services to various industry sectors and countries some of which
may be subject to specific export controls customs disclosures and denied parties regulations in
addition tnt express is occasionally required to provide information requested by authorities
investigating transport of certain restricted or regulated consignments to and from certain denied or
restricted parties the controls applied by tnt express may be insufficient to ensure all consignments
comply with all applicable regulations in all jurisdictions this can lead to investigations and operational
measures and in the event of any violations tnt express may be subject to fines and other
administrative sanctions such as discontinuation of service

unfavourable decisions by competition authorities concerning joint ventures acquisitions or
divestments could restrict tnt express growth and strategic progress and the ability to
compete in the market for its services this could affect its revenue and profitability
tnt express occasionally seeks alliances with or acquires shares in companies or seeks to divest part
of its business some joint ventures acquisitions or divestments of shares or a business require
approval by the competition authorities and this approval may contain certain restrictions or conditions
with respect to the intended transaction or may not be granted at all

the legal concept of limited liability for loss of or damage to goods carried by tnt express is
increasingly being challenged and this could result in increased exposure to claims thus
affecting revenue and profitability
tnt express transports goods under the conditions of the international convention regarding the
carriage of goods by air among others the warsaw convention and by road the convention on the
contract for the international carriage of goods by road these conventions contain provisions that
limit tnt express liability in the event that it loses or damages shipments belonging to its customers

in the past these principles were generally accepted as normal business practice but in recent years
courts and regulators in an increasing number of jurisdictions such as brazil have set aside these
principles of limited liability this exposes tnt express to higher claims

subcontractors might be classified as employees of tnt express which could affect its current
business model and thus affect tnt express profitability
tnt express hires subcontractors to perform certain aspects of its operations in certain jurisdictions
the authorities have brought criminal actions against subcontractors and in return subcontractors andor
their employees have brought civil actions against tnt express alleging that subcontractors andor their
employees engaged by tnt express are to be regarded as tnt express own unregistered employees
as a result tnt express could incur costs such as legal costs social security contributions wage taxes
and overtime payments in respect of such employees if these actions were successful operating
expenses could rise and could affect profitability

tnt express operations are subject to risks related to climate change regulation which could
affect its revenue and profitability
global concern about climate change could lead to governmental actions or unfavourable regulations
that require tnt express to reduce co2 emissions by its air and road fleet for example many local
governments are imposing regulations to limit both the volume of road traffic and emissions in city
centres such action or regulation could affect tnt express air and road transport as well as those of




                                                                                                         66

                                                                                                 governance
                                                                                                  chapter 4



its subcontractors in addition tnt airways has been subject to the requirements and obligations of the
eu emissions trading scheme since 1 january 2012

employee subcontractor and supplier misconduct could result in financial losses loss of clients
and fines or other sanctions imposed by the national and local governments and other
regulators of the countries in which tnt express does business
tnt express has implemented a compliance programme intended to protect it against risks relating to
fraud and other improper activities however notwithstanding this programme tnt express may be
unable to in all cases prevent its employees from engaging in misconduct fraud or other improper
activities that could adversely affect tnt express business and reputation misconduct could include
the failure to comply with applicable laws or tnt express business principles a breach of
confidentiality or breach of contract with clients as a result of employee misconduct tnt express
could incur fines and penalties imposed by governments in the countries in which it does business
furthermore tnt express customers could file claims andor terminate the contract for breach thereof
any such fines penalties or claims could depending on their magnitude lead to adjustments to the
financial statements and result in liabilities which could reduce profitability in addition negative
publicity in relation to employee misconduct could negatively affect tnt express reputation harm its
ability to recruit employees and reduce revenue

similar risks apply with regard to misconduct by tnt express subcontractors and suppliers in recent
years courts and regulators have increasingly held companies liable for acts of their independent
subcontractors and suppliers in view of this trend tnt express has communicated the tnt express
business principles to its subcontractors and suppliers and provides in a number of instances training
to ensure compliance however notwithstanding such communication and training activities tnt
express may nevertheless experience potential liabilities in connection with its subcontractors and
suppliers activities under certain circumstances if those subcontractors and suppliers engage in
conduct in violation of the tnt express business principles andor applicable laws

in addition the application of the compliance programme to certain subcontractors and suppliers may be
affected by the fact that in certain jurisdictions authorities have instituted actions against tnt express
alleging that subcontractors or their employees engaged by the company are to be regarded as tnt
express own unregistered employees

antitrust violations and investigations could result in fines that affect tnt express reputation
revenue and profitability
acts of or involvement in pricefixing andor anticompetitive behaviour by staff or involvement in
industrywide investigations may result in fines or other sanctions

financial risks

specific  financial risks
tnt express targets a bbbbaa1 credit rating lower ratings may increase financing costs and
harm its ability to finance operations and acquisitions which could negatively affect revenue
and profitability
tnt express current credit ratings are bbb stable and baa2 negative but there is no certainty that
tnt express can maintain or recover its targeted credit rating of bbb sp  baa1 moodys the
positive outlooks on its ratings during 2012 reflected the announcement of the proposed and
recommended offer by stronger rated ups but these have been removed due to the withdrawal of the
offer a downgrade of one or both of tnt express credit ratings may increase tnt express financing
costs and harm the companys ability to finance its operations and other major outlays

a breakup or a change in the composition of the eurozone and its currency could negatively
affect tnt express ability to finance its operations and negatively impact its financial
exposures
a breakup of or change in the composition of the eurozone and its currency could have a significant
impact on business performance among others due to the adverse macroeconomic impact such a
breakup would cause in addition a breakup or change could result in a significant devaluation of
assets and profits due to currency devaluations also it could restrict the free transfer of money and
currencies and may adversely affect the creditworthiness of tnt express counterparts

currency and interest rate fluctuations could affect tnt express revenue profitability and
equity
tnt express operates and sells its services globally and a substantial portion of its assets liabilities
costs sales and income are denominated in currencies other than the euro tnt express reporting
currency the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the euro may fluctuate in addition a
portion of tnt express borrowings and financial assets incur floating interest rates the main

                                                                                                  governance
                                                                                                   chapter 4



sensitivities on revenue and costs can be derived from geographical segmentation as provided in the
additional notes to the financial statements presented in chapter 5

although tnt express generally enters into hedging arrangements and other contracts to reduce its
exposure to currency and interest fluctuations these measures may be inadequate and consequently
these currency and interest fluctuations may result in increased operating or financing costs

there are no net investment hedges outstanding however significant acquisitions and local debts are
usually funded in the currency of the underlying assets such local debt may be structured via local bank
loans or via intercompany loans in the latter case the foreign exchange risk on the intercompany loan
is hedged with a bank which effectively results in the equivalent of local currency bank debt these
debts in local currency form a natural hedge against part of the foreign currency cash flow earnings
risks and translation exposures as a result fluctuations of local currency foreign exchange rates versus
the euro and fluctuations in local currency interest rates may affect tnt express revenue profitability
and equity refer to notes 29 and 30 of the consolidated financial statements

tnt express income tax liability may substantially increase if the tax laws and regulations in
countries in which it operates change or become subject to adverse interpretations or become
inconsistent this could affect its revenue profitability and financial position
taxes payable by companies in many of the countries in which tnt express operates includes taxes
on profit valueadded taxes payrollrelated taxes property taxes and other taxes tax laws and
regulations in some of these countries may be subject to frequent change varying interpretation and
inconsistent enforcement ineffective tax collection systems and continuing budget requirements may
increase the likelihood of the imposition of arbitrary or onerous taxes and penalties which could have a
material adverse effect on tnt express revenue profitability and financial position in addition to the
usual tax burden imposed on taxpayers these conditions create uncertainty as to the tax implications of
various business decisions this uncertainty could expose tnt express to fines and penalties and to
enforcement measures despite its best efforts at compliance and could result in a greater than
expected tax burden

in addition many of the jurisdictions in which tnt express operates have adopted transfer pricing
legislation if tax authorities impose significant additional tax liabilities as a result of transfer pricing
adjustments this could have a material adverse effect on its revenue profitability and financial condition
and may lead to double taxation it is also possible that tax authorities in the countries in which tnt
express operates will introduce additional revenue raising measures the introduction of any such
provisions may affect its overall tax efficiency and may result in significant additional taxes becoming
payable tnt express may also face a significant increase in its income taxes if tax rates increase or
the tax laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates or treaties between those
jurisdictions are modified in an adverse manner this may adversely affect its net income cash flows
liquidity and ability to pay dividends

if profitability were to be reduced tnt express might be unable to fully utilise its deferred tax
assets
at 31 december 2012 tnt express had 209 million recorded as net deferred tax assets in its
consolidated financial statements refer to note 22 of the consolidated financial statements these
assets can be utilised only if and only to the extent that its operating subsidiaries generate adequate
levels of taxable income in future periods to offset the tax loss carryforwards and reverse the temporary
differences prior to expiration at 31 december 2012 the amount of future income required to recover
tnt express deferred tax assets was approximately 800 million over a period of at least ten years at
certain operating subsidiaries

tnt express ability to generate taxable income is subject to general economic financial competitive
legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control if tnt express generates lower
taxable income than the amount it had assumed in determining its deferred tax assets the value of its
deferred tax assets will be reduced

tnt express insurance policy includes a retention clause and may not cover all damages which
could affect profitability
tnt express is insured via an inhouse captive insurance company for catastrophic risks under
insurance covers that are in line with market practice the insurance policy includes a retention own
risk clause the insurance policy may not cover all potential damages as the coverage is limited both in
the size of insured amounts as well as in the nature of the damage claims in case of damages and or
proven negligence these might not be fully covered

risks relating to securities of tnt express
as a result of the demerger tnt express may be held liable for tnt nvs obligations that were
outstanding at the date of the legal demerger
as a result of the demerger tnt express may be held liable for any obligations of postnl that were
outstanding within tnt nv as at the date of the legal demerger which postnl itself fails to meet

tnt express has entered into separate agreements with the pension funds and postnl in regards to
the pension liability of postnl to the pension funds in case of violation of contractual terms irregularity
of payments or bankruptcy of postnl tnt express may be held liable for pension premiums related to
pension benefits accrued under tnt nvs pension plans up to the date of the demerger even if these
are unrelated to tnt express employees

in addition to the pension funds another important obligation outstanding at the demerger is the
outstanding debts of tnt nv which include 16 billion in eurobonds

tnt express may not have recourse to another party for these payments except to the extent it has
recourse to postnl

material owners of tnt express nv ordinary shares could be in a position to exercise
proportionate but still significant influence this could affect the trading volume and market
price of the ordinary shares
postnl holds 298 of the ordinary shares of tnt express nv given the historical attendance rates of
general meetings of dutch listed companies this allows postnl and other material investors the ability
to exercise proportionate but still significant influence over certain corporate matters requiring approval
of a general meeting of shareholders subject to the relationship agreement in the case of postnl
refer to wwwtntcomcorporate for details this concentration of ownership could affect the trading
volume and market price of the ordinary shares

segment information
the company manages the business through five segments europe middle east and africa europe 
mea asia pacific brazil other americas and other networks of which the executive board of tnt
express receives operational and financial information on a monthly basis

our brazilian domestic operations which comprise the merged acquisitions of tnt mercúrio and
expresso araçatuba started to deteriorate in 2011 as part of the immediate actions in 2011 certain
changes in key management positions occurred and a temporary direct reporting line of the brazilian
domestic operations to the ceo was created although originally meant to be a temporary reporting line
only the subsequent developments have resulted that this direct reporting line has continued in 2012
and likely will continue in 2013 as a consequence the brazilian domestic operations are deemed to
qualify as a separate reporting segment under ifrs the reporting segment americas in which the
brazilian domestic operations were reported previously has been renamed other americas and
comparative numbers have been adjusted to reflect the new reporting segment in addition for the
goodwill impairment test the previous cashgenerating unit cgu south americas has been split into
the cgu brazil and the cgu other south americas

been assessed

changes in accounting policies and disclosures

a new and amended standards adopted by tnt express

there are no ifrss or ifric interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year
beginning 1 january 2012 that would be expected to have a material impact on the group

b new standards amendments and interpretations not yet adopted

expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statement of tnt express except the
following

   amendment to ias 1 financial statement presentation regarding other comprehensive income
    the main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items
    presented in other comprehensive income oci on the basis of whether they are potentially
    reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently reclassification adjustments the amendments do not
    address which items are presented in oci

   ias 19 employee benefits was amended in in june 2011 tnt express intends to adopt the
    revised ias 19 on 1 january 2013 the impact on the group will be as follows to eliminate the

    recognise all past service costs and to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets
    with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit

    those measured at fair value and those measured at amortised cost the determination is made at
    initial recognition the classification depends on the entitys business model for managing its
    financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument for financial
    liabilities the standard retains most of the ias 39 requirements the main change is that in cases
    where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities the part of a fair value change due to an
    entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income
    statement unless this creates an accounting mismatch tnt express is yet to assess ifrs 9s full
    impact and intends to adopt ifrs 9 on 1 january 2015

   ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements builds on existing principles by identifying the
    concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the
    consolidated financial statements of the parent company the standard provides additional
    guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess tnt express is yet
    to assess ifrs 10s full impact and intends to adopt ifrs 10 on 1 january 2014

   ifrs 11 joint arrangements replaces ias 31 interests in joint ventures and deals with how a
    joint arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control should be classified under ifrs
    11 joint ventures are required to be accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereas
    under ias 31 jointly controlled entities can be accounted for using the equity method of accounting

    express would have applied the equity method instead of the proportionate consolidation method to
    account for joint ventures the reported net sales and operating income for 2012 would have
    decreased by 87 million and 11 million respectively while profit attributable to shareholders would
    remain constant refer to note 32 for the disclosure on joint ventures tnt express intends to adopt
    ifrs 11 on 1 january 2014

   ifrs 12 disclosures of interests in other entities includes the disclosure requirements for all
    forms of interests in other entities including joint arrangements associates special purpose
    vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles tnt express is yet to assess ifrs 12s full impact
    and intends to adopt ifrs 12 on 1 january 2014

   ifrs 13 fair value measurement aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by
    providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and
    disclosure requirements for use across ifrss the requirements which are largely aligned with us
    gaap do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be
    applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within ifrs or us gaap
    tnt express intends to adopt ifrs 13 on 1 january 2013 and does not expect significant impact
    on the consolidated financial statements

there are no other ifrs or ifric interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to
have a material impact on the group

consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include the financial numbers of tnt express nv and its
subsidiaries associates and joint ventures and have been prepared using uniform accounting policies
for similar transactions and other events in similar circumstances all significant intercompany
transactions balances and unrealised gains on transactions have been eliminated on consolidation
unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred a complete list of subsidiaries associates and joint ventures included in tnt express
consolidated financial statements is filed for public review at the chamber of commerce in amsterdam
this list has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of article 379 1 and article 414 of book 2
of the dutch civil code

as the financial statements of tnt express nv are included in the consolidated financial statements
the corporate income statement is presented in an abridged form article 402 of book 2 of the dutch
civil code

subsidiaries associates and joint ventures
subsidiaries are all entities including special purpose entities over which tnt express has the power
to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one
half of the voting rights the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable
or convertible are considered when assessing whether tnt express controls another entity

an associate is an entity that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture over which
commercial and financial policy decisions tnt express has significant influence significant influence is
the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but is not control or
joint control over those policies tnt express share of results of all significant associates is included in
the income statement using the equity method the carrying value of tnt express share in associates
includes goodwill on acquisition and changes to reflect tnt express share in net earnings of the
respective companies reduced by dividends received tnt express share in nondistributed earnings
of associates is included in net investment when tnt express share of any accumulated losses
exceeds the acquisition value of the shares in the associates the book value is reduced to zero and the
reporting of losses ceases unless tnt express is bound by guarantees or other undertakings in
relation to the associate

a joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby tnt express and one or more other parties
undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control joint ventures in which tnt express
participates with other parties are proportionately consolidated in applying the proportionate
consolidation method tnt express percentage share of the balance sheet and income statement
items are included in tnt express consolidated financial statements

business combinations
tnt express uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries
the consideration of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred equity
instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange the consideration




                                                                                                          78

                                                                                                     statements
                                                                                                      chapter 5



transferred includes also the fair value arising from contingent consideration arrangements acquisition
related costs are expensed as incurred identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition
date irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling interest

the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of tnt express share of the identifiable
net assets of the subsidiary is recorded as goodwill if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of
tnt express share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised directly in
the income statement

tnt express treats transactions with noncontrolling interests as transactions with equity owners for
purchases from noncontrolling interests the difference between any consideration paid and the
relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity gains
or losses on disposals to noncontrolling interests are also recorded in equity

when tnt express ceases to have control or significant influence any retained interest in the entity is
remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in income statement the
fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the retained
interest as an associate joint venture or financial asset in addition any amounts previously recognised
in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if tnt express had
directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities this could lead to a reclassification of amounts
previously recognised in other comprehensive income to the income statement

the noncontrolling interest is initially measured at the proportion of the noncontrolling interest in the
recognised net fair value of the assets liabilities and contingent liabilities losses applicable to the non
controlling interest in excess of its share of the subsidiarys equity are allocated against tnt express
interests except to the extent that the noncontrolling interest has a binding obligation and is able to
make an additional investment to cover the losses subsidiaries accounting policies have been changed
where necessary to ensure consistency with tnt express accounting policies

functional currency and presentation currency
items included in the financial statements of all tnt express entities are measured using the currency
of the primary environment in which the entity operates the functional currency the consolidated
financial statements are presented in euros which is the functional and presentation currency of tnt
express

foreign currency transactions and balances
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the date of the transactions monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are
translated to the functional currency using yearend exchange rates

foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency
transactions and balances and from the translation at yearend exchange rates are recognised in the
income statement except for qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges that are
directly recognised in equity

foreign operations
the results and financial position of all tnt express entities none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy with a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows
 assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate
 income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates and
 the resulting exchange differences based on the different ways of translation between the balance
     sheet and the income statement are recognised as a separate component of equity translation
     reserve

foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign
entities and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments
are recognised in the translation reserve when a foreign operation is sold such exchange differences
are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on the sale

goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing exchange rate




                                                                                                            79

                                                                                                   chapter 5



intangible assets

goodwill
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the share of the
identifiable net assets acquired by tnt express goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and joint
ventures is included in intangible assets goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in the carrying
amount of investments in associates

goodwill is recognised as an asset and although it is not amortised it is reviewed for impairment
annually and whenever there is a possible indicator of impairment any impairment is recognised
immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed goodwill is carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses on disposal of an entity any residual amount of goodwill is included in
the determination of the profit or loss on disposal

goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to ifrs has been retained at the previous
historical values as no adjustment was required on transition these have also been subject to
impairment tests at that date and will continue to be at least annually

other intangible assets
costs related to the development and installation of software for internal use are capitalised at historical
cost and amortised using the straightline method over the estimated useful life apart from software
other intangible assets mainly include customer relationships assets under development licences and
concessions other intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at
the acquisition date

an asset under development is reclassified when it is ready for use and is subsequently amortised using
the straightline method over its estimated useful life other intangible assets are valued at the lower of
historical cost less amortisation and impairment

property plant and equipment
property plant and equipment are valued at historical cost using a component approach less
depreciation and impairment losses in addition to the costs of acquisition the company also includes
costs of bringing the asset to working condition handling and installation costs and the nonrefundable
purchase taxes under the component approach each component of an item of property plant and
equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item shall be depreciated
separately

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method based on the estimated useful life taking into
account any residual value the assets residual value and useful life is reviewed and adjusted if
appropriate at each balance sheet date subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount
or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably

land is not depreciated system software is capitalised and amortised as a part of the tangible fixed
asset for which it was acquired to operate because the estimated useful life is inextricably linked to the
estimated useful life of the associated asset

leases of property plant and equipment are classified as finance leases if the company has
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership finance leases are capitalised at the leases
inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum
lease payments the corresponding rental obligations net of finance charges are included in longterm
debt property plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of
the assets useful life and the lease term

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment

goodwill
goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an
indication that the asset might be impaired

for the purposes of assessing impairment assets are grouped by cashgenerating unit cgu the
lowest level at which there are separately identifiable cash flows for impairment testing of goodwill the
group of cgus is defined as the lowest level where goodwill is monitored for internal purposes this




                                                                                                         80

                                                                                                      statements
                                                                                                       chapter 5



level may be higher than the level used for testing other assets but is not at a higher level than an
operating segment

if the recoverable value of the cgu is less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the
unit prorata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit the recoverable amount is
the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use in assessing the value in use the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the asset specific risks for the purpose of
assessing impairment corporate assets are allocated to specific cgus before impairment testing the
allocation of the corporate assets is based on the contribution of those assets to the future cash flows of
the cgu under review goodwill following the acquisition of associates is not separately recognised or
tested for impairment

impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in a subsequent period

finite lived intangible assets and property plant and equipment
at each balance sheet date tnt express reviews the carrying amount of its finite lived intangible assets
and property plant and equipment to determine whether there is an indication that those assets have
suffered an impairment loss if any indication exists the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated
in order to determine the extent if any of the impairment loss an asset is impaired if the recoverable
amount is lower than the carrying value the recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an assets
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use

if the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying
amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount any impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the income statement impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed
only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount
since the last impairment loss was recognised the recoverable amount shall not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years a
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement

financial assets and liabilities
tnt express classifies financial assets and liabilities into the following categories financial assets and
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss loans and receivables heldtomaturity investments
availableforsale financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost the classification
depends on the purpose for which the financial asset or liability was acquired management determines
the classification of tnt express financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition

financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include derivatives and other
assets and liabilities that are designated as such upon initial recognition

measurement at fair value requires disclosure of measurement methods based on the following fair
value measurement hierarchy
 level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets
 level 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly prices or indirectly
    derived from prices
 level 3 inputs not based on observable market data

financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are initially recorded at fair
value and subsequently remeasured at fair value on the balance sheet tnt express designates certain
derivatives as hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities of a firm commitment fair
value hedge hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecasted transaction cash flow hedge or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
net investment hedge

if a derivative is designated as a cash flow or net investment hedge changes in its fair value are
considered to be effective and recorded in a separate component in equity until the hedged item is
recorded in income any portion of a change in the fair value of a derivative that is considered to be
ineffective or is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness is immediately recorded in the income
statement

at the inception of the transaction tnt express documents the relationship between hedging
instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions the company also documents the assessment both at hedge inception and




                                                                                                             81

                                                                                                    statements
                                                                                                     chapter 5



on an ongoing basis of whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items

changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are
recorded in the income statement together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or
liability that are attributable to the hedged risk

amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged
item will affect income statement for example when the forecasted sale that is hedged takes place
however when the forecasted transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a nonfinancial
asset the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the
initial measurement of the asset or liability

when a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting any cumulative gains or losses existing in equity at that time remain in equity until the
forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement when a forecasted transaction
is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gains or losses that were reported in equity are
immediately transferred to the income statement

loans granted and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market and for which tnt express has no intention of trading loans
and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet except for maturities
greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date these are classified as noncurrent assets

heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
and fixed maturities where tnt express has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity

availableforsale financial assets are nonderivative financial assets that are either designated in this
category or not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets or liabilities they are
included in noncurrent assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12
months at the balance sheet date availableforsale financial assets are carried at fair value

loans and receivables and heldtomaturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest method unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets
and liabilities classified at fair value through income statement are directly recorded in the income
statement

unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets classified as
availableforsale are recognised in other comprehensive income when financial assets classified as
availableforsale are sold or impaired the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the
income statement as a gain or a loss

the fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices if the market for a financial asset
is not active and for unlisted securities tnt express establishes fair value by using valuation
techniques these include the use of recent arms length transactions reference to other instruments
that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis refined to reflect the issuers specific
circumstances

tnt express assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired in the case of equity securities classified as available
forsale a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in
determining whether the securities are impaired if any such evidence exists for availableforsale
financial assets the cumulative loss  measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the
current fair value less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in income
statement  is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement impairment losses on
equity instruments recognised in the income statement are not reversed through equity

financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction
costs incurred and are subsequently stated at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net
of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of
the financial liability using the effective interest method

inventory
inventories of raw materials and finished goods are valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable
value historical cost is based on weighted average prices




                                                                                                           82

                                                                                                statements
                                                                                                 chapter 5



accounts receivable
accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method less allowance for impairment an allowance for impairment of
accounts receivable is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables the amount of the allowance
is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
flows discounted at the effective interest rate the amount of the loss is recognised in the income
statement any reversal of the impairment loss is included in the income statement at the same line as
where the original expense has been recorded

the risk of uncollectibility of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with
and the past due status of doubtful debtors while large accounts are assessed individually based on
factors that include ability to pay bankruptcy and payment history in addition debtors in certain
countries are subject to a higher collectability risk which is taken into account when assessing the
overall risk of uncollectability the assumptions and estimates applied for determining the valuation
allowance are reviewed periodically

cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at fair value cash and cash equivalents
include cash at hand bank account balances bills of exchange and cheques only those which can be
cashed in the short term all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less
at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents bank overdrafts are not netted off from cash
and cash equivalents

assets or disposal groups classified as held for disposal and discontinued
operations
assets or disposal groups are classified as assets held for disposal and stated at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is recovered principally by
means of disposal rather than through continuing use assets held for disposal are no longer amortised
or depreciated from the time they are classified as such

assets classified as held for disposal are available for immediate disposal in its present condition and
are considered as highly probable

operations that represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or that
are part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical
area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale and either have been
disposed of or have been classified as held for disposal are presented as discontinued operations in
tnt express income statement

equity
ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares or options are presented in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds

where any group company purchases tnt express equity share capital treasury shares the
consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is
deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled reissued or disposed of where such shares are
subsequently sold or reissued any consideration received net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects are included in equity

provisions for pension liabilities
the obligation for all pension and other postemployment plans that qualify as defined benefit plans is
determined by calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and deducting the fair value
of the plan assets tnt express uses actuarial calculations projected unit credit method to measure
the obligations and the costs for the calculations actuarial assumptions are made about demographic
variables such as employee turnover mortality and disability and financial variables such as the
expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate is determined by reference to market rates

cumulative actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the balance sheet the portion of the
cumulative actuarial gains and losses that exceed the higher of 10 of the obligation or 10 of the fair
value of plan assets corridor approach are recognised in the income statement over the employees
expected average remaining service years




                                                                                                       83

                                                                                                   statements
                                                                                                    chapter 5



past service costs if any are recognised on a straightline basis over the average vesting period of the
amended pension or early retirement benefits certain past service costs may be recognised
immediately if the benefits vest immediately

gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised at the date of
the curtailment or settlement

pension costs for defined contribution plans are expensed in the income statement when incurred or
due

other provisions
provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event it is probable
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation provisions are measured at the present
value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the
balance sheet date the discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability the gross up of the
provision following the discounting of the provision is recorded in the income statement statement as
interest expense

provisions are recorded for employee benefit obligations restructuring onerous contracts and other
obligations

the provision for employee benefit obligations includes longservice leave or sabbatical leave jubilee or
other longservice benefits longterm disability benefits and if they are not payable wholly within 12
months after the end of the period profitsharing bonuses and deferred compensation the expected
costs of these benefits are recognised over the period of employment actuarial gains and losses and
changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to income in the period such gain or loss
occurs related service costs are recognised immediately

the provision recorded for restructuring largely relates to termination benefits termination benefits are
payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits tnt express recognises termination
benefits when the company has committed to terminate the employment of current employees according
to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or provide termination benefits as a result of an
offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy benefits falling due more than 12 months after balance
sheet date are discounted to their present value

provisions for onerous contracts are recorded when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation
under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to arise from that contract taking into
account impairment of fixed assets first

the provision for other obligations relates to legal and contractual obligations and received claims

trade accounts payable
trade accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method

income taxes
the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive
income

the amount of income tax included in the income statement is determined in accordance with the rules
established by the taxation authorities based on which income taxes are payable or recoverable

deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and the tax base of assets and liabilities are calculated using the substantively
enacted tax rates expected to apply when they are realised or settled deferred tax assets are
recognised if it is probable that they will be realised deferred tax assets and liabilities where a legally
enforceable right to offset exists and within the same tax group are presented net in the balance sheet




                                                                                                          84

revenue recognition
revenue is recognised when services are rendered goods are delivered or work is completed revenue
is the gross inflow of economic benefits during the current year that arise from ordinary activities and
result in an increase in equity other than increases relating to contributions from equity participants

revenues of delivered goods and services are recognised when
 the company has transferred to a buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
   and services
 the company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
   with ownership nor effective control of the goods and services sold
 the amounts of revenue are measured reliably
 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the company
 the costs to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and
 the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably

revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration of received amounts or receivable amounts

amounts received in advance are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are rendered to
customers or goods are delivered

net sales
net sales represent the revenue from the delivery of goods and services to third parties less discounts
credit notes and taxes levied on sales accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the
discounts and returns

other operating revenue
other operating revenue relates to the sale of goods and rendering of services not related to the normal
trading activities of tnt express and mainly include sale of passengercharter revenue custom
clearance income and administration fees

other income
other income includes net gains or losses from the sale of property plant and equipment and other
gains and losses costs are recognised on the historical cost convention and are allocated to the
reporting year to which they relate

operating expenses
operating expenses represent the direct and indirect expenses attributable to sales including cost of
materials cost of work contracted out and other external expenses personnel expenses directly related
to operations and depreciation amortisation and impairment charges

profitsharing and bonus plans
tnt express recognises a liability and an expense for cashsettled bonuses and profitsharing when the
company has a legal or constructive obligation to make such payments as a result of past performance
and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made based on a formula that takes into consideration
the profit attributable after normalisation for certain oneoff items

sharebased payments
prior to demerger tnt nv had equitysettled sharebased compensation plans including those of tnt
express employees sharebased payment transactions are transactions in which tnt express
receives benefits from its employees in consideration for equity instruments or for amounts of cash that
are based on the price of equity instruments of the company the fair value of the equitysettled share
based transactions is recognised as an expense part of the employee costs and a corresponding
increase in equity over the vesting period the fair value of sharebased payments under the companys
performance share plan is calculated using the monte carlo model the equity instruments granted do
not vest until the employee completes a specific period of service




                                                                                                      85

                                                                                                  statements
                                                                                                   chapter 5



due to the demerger all these plans were terminated and settled prior to the demerger this settlement
was accounted for as an accelerated vesting which resulted in expense recognition of the remaining
grant date fair value

in 2011 after the demerger a new sharebased payment plan matching plan was introduced by tnt
express nv which will be cashsettled upon vesting the fair value of cashsettled sharebased
payment transactions is measured at each reporting date and at settlement the fair value is recognised
as an expense part of the employee costs and a corresponding increase in liabilities over the vesting
period

interest income and expense
interest income and expense are recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest
method interest income comprises interest income on borrowings changes in the fair value of financial
assets at fair value through profit or loss foreign currency gains and gains on hedged items interest

currency losses changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
impairment losses recognised on financial assets and losses on hedged items

all borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method except
to the extent that they can be capitalised as cost of a qualifying asset

grants
grants are recognised initially as income when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received
and tnt express has complied with the conditions associated with the grant grants that compensate
tnt express for expenses incurred are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis in the
same period in which the expenses are recognised grants that compensate tnt express for the cost
of an asset are deducted from the historical value of the asset and recognised in the income statement
on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset

operating leases
leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
operating leases payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the
lessor are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the period of the lease

dividend distribution

in the year in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders if tnt express offers its
shareholders dividends in additional shares the additionally issued shares are recognised at their
nominal amount

consolidated statement of cash flows

currencies are translated at average exchange rates exchange rate differences affecting cash items are
shown separately in the consolidated statement of cash flows receipts and payments with respect to
taxation on profits are included in cash flows from operating activities interest payments are included in
cash flows from operating activities while interest receipts are included in cash flows from investing
activities the cost of acquisition of subsidiaries associates and investments insofar as it was paid for
in cash is included in cash flows from investing activities acquisitions of subsidiaries are presented net

critical accounting estimates and judgments in applying tnt express
accounting policies
the preparation of the financial statements of tnt express requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of tnt express financial statements
estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances

tnt express makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future the resulting accounting
estimates will by definition seldom equal the related actual results the estimates and assumptions that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year are discussed below

business combinations
tnt express accounts for all its business combinations applying the acquisition method the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised and measured on the basis of their fair values at the
date of acquisition to determine fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed tnt express
must make estimates and use valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available any
excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired represents
goodwill

for purposes of preparation of the consolidated financial statements internal reorganisations or transfer
of businesses between tnt express companies were accounted for at predecessor carrying amounts
these transactions did not give rise to goodwill

impairment of assets
in determining impairments of intangible assets including goodwill property plant and equipment and
financial fixed assets management must make significant judgments and estimates to determine
whether the fair value of the cash flows generated by those assets is less than their carrying value
determining cash flows requires the use of judgments and estimates that have been included in the
strategic plans and longrange forecasts of tnt express the data necessary for executing the
impairment tests are based on management estimates of future cash flows which require estimating
revenue growth rates and profit margins for applied sensitivities on intangible assets refer to note 1

depreciation and amortisation of property plant and equipment and intangible fixed
assets
property plant and equipment and intangible fixed assets except for goodwill are depreciated or
amortised at historical cost using a straightline method based on the estimated useful life taking into
account any residual value the assets residual value and useful life are based on tnt express best
estimates and reviewed and adjusted if required at each balance sheet date

impairment of receivables
the risk of uncollectability of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with
and the past due status of doubtful debtors while large accounts are individually assessed based on
factors that include ability to pay bankruptcy and payment history in addition debtors in certain
countries are subject to a higher collectability risk which is taken into account when assessing the
overall risk of uncollectability should the outcome differ from the assumptions and estimates revisions
to the estimated valuation allowances would be required

restructuring
restructuring charges mainly result from restructuring operations including combinations andor
relocations of operations changes in tnt express strategic direction or managerial responses to
declining demand increasing costs or other market factors restructuring provisions reflect many
estimates including those pertaining to separation costs reduction of excess facilities contract
settlements and tangible asset impairments actual experience has been and may continue to be
different from these estimates

income taxes
the company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions significant judgment is required in
determining the worldwide provision and liability for income taxes there are many transactions and
calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business
tnt express recognises liabilities for tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be




                                                                                                        87

                                                                                                    statements
                                                                                                     chapter 5



due based on its best interpretation of the relevant tax laws and rules where the final tax outcome of
these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will impact the
income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made

tnt express recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits
will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered this is based on estimates of taxable income by
jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are
recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods and depending
on the tax strategies that the company may be able to implement changes to the recognition of deferred
tax assets could be required which could impact tnt express financial position and net profit

accounting for assets classified as held for disposal
accounting for assets classified as held for disposal requires the use of significant assumptions and
estimates such as the assumptions used in the fair value calculations as well as the estimated costs to
dispose

pension benefits
the present value of the pension obligation depends on a number of factors that are determined on an
actuarial basis using a number of assumptions any change in these assumptions will impact the
carrying amount of pension obligations the assumptions used in determining the net pension
expenseincome include the discount rate the discount rate is based on the longterm yield of high
quality corporate bonds other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current
market conditions tnt express reviews the assumptions at the end of each year additional information
is disclosed in note 10

contingent liabilities
legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending against the company in various jurisdictions
due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters it is often difficult to predict the final outcome the cases
and claims against the company often raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues that are
subject to many uncertainties and complexities including but not limited to the facts and circumstances
of each particular case and claim the jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law in the normal
course of business tnt express consults with legal counsel and certain other experts on matters
related to litigations

tnt express accrues a liability when it is determined that an adverse outcome is probable and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event an adverse outcome is possible or an
estimate is not determinable the matter is disclosed




                                                                                                           88

goodwill
goodwill is allocated to tnt express cashgenerating units cgus and tested for impairment the
cgus correspond to operations in a region and the nature of the services that are provided and include
northern europe southern europe  mea asia pacific north america brazil other south americas
and other networks

in 2012 as a result of managements decision to divest the china domestic operation the business is
classified as asset held for disposal as a disposal group china domestic was measured at the lower of
its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell which resulted in a write down of its carrying amount by
75 million refer to note 8 for the disclosure information related to assets held for disposal

china domestic was part of cgu asia pacific of the total goodwill amount of cgu asia pacific 125
million was allocated to china domestic as part of its carrying amount being its allocated goodwill
consequently the write down of its carrying amount was accounted for as a goodwill impairment of 75
million with the remaining 50 million being classified as held for disposal

in 2012 the exit of the indian domestic business and the liquidation of the related legal entity was
finalised consequently a goodwill impairment of 19 million was recorded relating to the allocated
goodwill of the indian domestic business the goodwill of 19 million was allocated to the cgu asia
pacific

in 2011 the goodwill impairment of 209 million was related to the brazil operations as a result of
revenue losses and performance pressure the addition of 3 million was related to southern europe 
mea whereby a settlement of 3 million was received in 2011 related to the purchase price of tg plus

based on the 2012 financial performance a detailed review has been performed of the recoverable
amount of each cgu the recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and fair value less cost
to sell fair value less cost to sell represents the best estimate of the amount tnt express would
receive if it were to sell the cgu the fair value was estimated on the basis of the present value of
future cash flows taking into account cost to sell for cgu asia pacific the recoverable amount and the
carrying value applied exclude the china domestic operation as a result of it being classified as assets
held for disposal

for mature markets the estimated future net cash flows are based on a fiveyear forecast and business
plan for emerging markets where no steady state has been achieved to date a tenyear forecast has
been applied to estimate the future net cash flows the applied growth rate does not exceed the long
term average growth rate of the related operations and markets the cash flow projections based on
financial budgets have been approved by management

tnt express determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations
for market development the weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts
included in industry reports the discount rates used in the cgus valuations vary from 104 to 182
pretax posttax 78 to 120 to reflect specific risks relating to each cgu

key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values of all cgus are
 maturity of the underlying market market share and volume development to determine the revenue
    mix and growth rate
 level of capital expenditure in network related assets that may affect the further rollout of the
    network
 level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development taking into account
    the nature of the underlying costs and potential economies of scale and
 discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency
    and inflation related risks

management has carried out an impairment test and concluded that the recoverable amount based on
value in use of the individual cgus is higher than the carrying amount a sensitivity analysis has been
applied for all cgus this sensitivity analysis included the individual impact of the following items which
are considered to be the most critical when determining the recoverable value
 increase of the discount factor by 1 and 2
 increase of capital expenditure by 5 per year and
 decrease of operating income by 5 per year

compared to the impairment test of 2011 the headroom for cgu southern europe  mea has reduced
from around 400 million to around 300 million as a reflection of the general macroeconomic
environment in that region the result of the sensitivity analysis for this cgu at an increase of the
discount factor by 2 would reduce such headroom further to around 30 million

benefit plan closed for new entries as of 1 january 2005 the second plan applicable to new hires as
from 1 january 2005 is a defined contribution plan with a minimum return guarantee the defined
benefit plan provides lump sum benefits based on years of service and final salary the defined benefit
plan is funded via direct insurance with an external insurance company the contributions of the defined
contribution plan are invested in public investment funds administered by an external party the risk
coverage for death and disability benefits within the defined contribution plan is directly insured with an
external insurance company

defined benefit plans in australia
in australia tnt express contributes to several superannuation funds with the exception of the tnt
group superannuation plan tnt gsp a fund with both defined benefit and defined contribution
sections all other payments are made to defined contribution plans the tnt gsp was established
under a master trust as a subplan of the mercer superannuation trust the defined benefit section of
tnt gsp provides lump sum benefits based on years of service and final average salary the defined
contribution section receives fixed contributions from group companies and the groups obligation is
limited to these contributions

defined benefit plans in italy
in italy in accordance with italian law employers have to pay to employees upon the termination of
employment a lump sum indemnity trattamento di fine rapporto tfr equivalent to the total
annually revalued benefits accrued over the years of service until 31 december 2006 this was an
unfunded defined benefit plan whereby employers were obliged to accrue for this termination benefit
starting from 1 january 2007 due to legislation change tfr is no longer accrued by the employer but
by external providers mainly the national social security institute employers contribute to the fund the
equivalent of the accrued tfr therefore the tfr liability for tnt express consists of the unfunded
benefits accrued up to 31 december 2006 and of the obligation reflecting the annual revaluation of
these accrued benefits

at 31 december 2012 the defined benefit plans described above covers approximately 98 of the tnt
express group obligation for postemployment benefits and approximately 99 of the tnt express
group plan assets

defined benefit pension costs recognised in the income statement
the valuation of the pension obligation of tnt express and the determination of its pension cost are
based on key assumptions that include employee turnover mortality rates and retirement ages discount
rates expected longterm returns on plan assets pension increases and future wage increases which
are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each financial year actual circumstances may vary
from these assumptions giving rise to a different pension liability at yearend the difference between
the projected pension liability based on the assumptions and the actual pension liability at yearend are
reflected in the balance sheet as part of the actuarial gains and losses if the cumulative actuarial gains
and losses exceed the corridor the excess will be amortised over the employees expected average
remaining service years and reflected as an additional profit or expense in tnt express income
statement in the next year

in 2012 tnt express expense for postemployment benefit plans was 20 million 2011 2 the 2011
net expense of 2 million included 18 million expense offset by 16 million settlement gain as a
consequence of the demerger from postnl nv total cash contribution for post employment benefit
plans in 2012 amounted to 46 million 2011 33 of which 9 million is related to recovery payment for
the defined benefit plan in the netherlands total cash contribution for 2013 is estimated to be around

in 2011 the settlement in the benefit obligation and plan assets were a result of the new separate
execution agreements with the dutch pension funds with regards to the allocated tnt express
employees as a consequence of the demerger this resulted in a oneoff settlement gain of 16 million

tnt express pension expense is affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations
and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets management reviews these and other
assumptions every year measurement date for tnt express postemployment benefits is 31
december changes in assumptions may occur as a result of economic and market conditions if actual
results differ from those assumed this will generate actuarial gains or losses these are amortised over
the employees expected average remaining service years if they exceed the corridor

ias 19 employee benefits requires an entity to determine the rates used to discount employee benefit
obligations with reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds the first step of the process
is to identify a set of bonds that accurately reflects the relationship between yield and remaining time to
maturity for high quality corporate bonds for this tnt express uses the iboxx aa rated corporate bond
universe using the bond selection regression analysis is used to find the bestfitting curve that states
yieldtomaturity as a function of remaining time to maturity in 2012 the nelsonsiegel model is applied
to fit the curve towards tnt express 22 year duration the resulting discount rate per 31 december
2012 is 39

management considers various factors to determine the expected return on plan assets the expected
return is based on the current longterm rates of return on bonds and applies to these rates a suitable
risk premium for the different asset components the premium is based on the plans asset mix
historical market returns and current market expectation

assumptions regarding future mortality are based on advice published statistics and experience per
country the average life expectancy of men after retiring at the age of 63 is 22 years 2011 20 the
equivalent expectancy for women is 24 years 2011 22

oneoff investmentmatching plan
to align the objectives of members of the executive board and senior management with longterm
value creation and the interests of shareholders before the demerger the supervisory board of tnt
nv decided to apply a voluntary oneoff investmentmatching plan in which the cash proceeds from the
unwinding of the tnt nv bonusmatching plan performance share plan and option plan could  post
demerger  be invested in tnt express nv shares the participants could elect to invest from their net
proceeds an amount equal to 25 or 50 of their total gross unwindingrelated sum but not more than
the net proceeds thereof in tnt express nv shares on the same date these shares in the plan
called investment shares were purchased the participant received free of charge a matching right on
phantom shares representing the value in cash of half of the number of investment shares matching on
a 1 05 basis this matching right will vest and the cash value of the phantom shares comprising the
matching right will be paid after three years provided that the participant i has remained an employee
throughout and ii still owns at least 50 of hisher investment shares

if prior to vesting the participant sold more than half of hisher investment shares the matching right will
forfeit in full and if the participant sold 50 or fewer of hisher investment shares the number of
phantom shares comprising the matching right will be reduced proportionally

the following table shows the number of phantom shares comprising the matching rights granted to
the members of the executive board under the oneoff investmentmatching plan

bonusmatching plan  senior management
members of a selected group of managers may on a voluntary basis participate in the bonusmatching
plan in such case they can convert 25 of their bonus paid in cash in tnt express nv shares in the
plan called bonus shares with an associated matching right if at least 50 of the bonus shares is kept
for three years

the company sees the bonusmatching plan as part of the remuneration package for the members of its
top management and it is particularly aimed at further aligning with the interests of shareholders and
longterm value creation

grants are made in accordance with the bonusmatching plan which has been approved by the
supervisory board for 2011 the matching rights comprise phantom shares so that after three years the
rights under this plan will be settled in cash

the significant aspects of the plan are
 bonus shares are purchased from the participants net proceeds using 25 of the gross bonus
    amount the matching right is granted upon the purchase of the bonus shares
 the number of bonus shares is calculated by dividing 25 of an individuals gross annual bonus
    relating to the preceding financial year by the share price on the euronext amsterdam on the date
    the grant is made 6 june 2011 947share
 the rights to phantom shares are granted for zero costs and the number of phantom shares is
    equal to the number of bonus shares matching on a 11 basis

        the value at vesting of the phantom shares is delivered in cash after a holding period of three years
         after the grant
        for each bonus share that is sold within three years the associated right to one matching phantom
         share lapses if more than 50 of the bonus shares is sold within three years the entire right to
         matching phantom shares lapses with immediate effect
        where a participant leaves the company for certain reasons retirement certain reorganisations
         disability or death the matching right will vest immediately and heshe receives cash on a prorata
         basis
        a participant loses the matching right with immediate effect in case heshe leaves the company for
         reasons other than those mentioned above

income taxes in the income statement and the current tax expense is due to temporary differences
these temporary differences are recognised as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities the

in percentages


in 2012 the effective income tax rate was 2723 2011 581 which differs significantly from the
statutory income tax rate of 25 in the netherlands 2011 25 this difference is mainly caused by
the impact of nondeductible impairments of 550  2011 357 the adverse impact of several non
deductible costs is 187  2011 48 while the effect of different income tax rates in other countries
was 67 2011 02

the line other includes several effects
 current year losses for which no deferred tax assets could be recognised due to uncertainty
    regarding the recoverability of such assets resulted in an impact of 851  2011 329
 derecognition of previous recognised deferred tax assets impacted the effective tax rate by 774
    2011 04
 positive effects from several optimisation projects impacted the effective tax rate by 260 2011

       the remaining other impact of 438 2011 167 reflects changes in accounting estimates
        relating to deferred tax balances local taxes and the net impact of several other positive and
        negative effects

at 31 december 2012 the income tax receivable amounted to 14 million 2011 29 and the income tax
payable amounted to 44 million 2011 31 in 2012 tnt express paid taxes for an amount of 66

deferred tax assets of 2 million are included in assets classified as held for disposal

deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented net in the balance sheet if tnt express has a legally
enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate
to the same taxation authority out of the total other deferred tax assets of 47 million 2011 54 an
amount of 16 million 2011 24 is related to temporary differences for assets that are both capitalised
and depreciable for tax purposes only

the total accumulated losses available for carry forward at 31 december 2012 amounted to 1372
million 2011 1085 with these losses carried forward future tax benefits of 419 million could be
recognised 2011 331 tax deductible losses give rise to deferred tax assets at the substantively
enacted statutory tax rate in the relevant country deferred tax assets are recognised if it is probable
that they will be realised the probability of the realisation is impacted by uncertainties regarding the
realisation of such benefits for example as a result of the expiration of tax losses carried forward and
projected future taxable income as a result tnt express has not recognised 310 million 2011 190
of the potential future tax benefits and has recorded deferred tax assets of 109 million at the end of
2012 2011 141

notes to the consolidated statement of cash flows
the noncash transactions in the consolidated statement of cash flows relate to depreciation
amortisation and impairment charges sharebased payment expenses result from investments in
associates foreign exchange gains and losses investments in property plant and equipment financed
via financial leases book result on sale of property plant and equipment and changes in provisions

23 net cash from operating activities 271 million 2011 191
in 2012 the net cash from operating activities increased by 80 million from 191 million in 2011 to
271 million

cash generated from operations
the cash generated from operations increased from 359 million in 2011 to 383 million in 2012 in
2012 the profit before income taxes contributed 47 million or 340 million 2011 342 adjusted for the
noncash impact of depreciation amortisation impairments and sharebased payments this is in line
with 2011

the change in net pension liabilities of 26 million in 2012 2011 31 reflects the total tnt express
noncash employer pension expense for the postemployment defined benefit plans of 20 million
2011 2 compared to the total tnt express cash contributions to various postemployment defined
benefit plans for a total amount of 46 million 2011 33 of which 9 million relates to recovery payment
for the defined benefit plans in the netherlands

in 2012 there was a net cash outflow of 22 million in other provisions compared to a net positive
change of 11 million in 2011 this was mainly due to the utilisation of the restructuring provision and
the utilisation of the provision for claims and indemnities in 2012

in 2012 the net cash inflow related to working capital amounted to 35 million which is an improvement
of 43 million compared to 2011 2011 8 mainly due to higher net cash inflow from trade working
capital as a result of improved dayssalesoutstanding

interest paid
the total cash outflow for interest paid in 2012 is 46 million 2011 58 in 2012 interest paid includes
interest on tnt express financial leases of 11 million 2011 11 in addition interest payments of 10
million 2011 18 are included for shortterm debt of which 6 million 2011 7 is due to cash pools that
is offset in the interest received and for interest on foreign currency hedges of 19 million 2011 23
and interest paid on taxes of 3 million 2011 0 the decrease in interest on foreign currency hedges
was mainly caused by lower interest rate differentials between currencies in foreign exchange forward
contracts mainly in the matured eurusd cross currency swap

the interest paid and received on notional cash pools are reported on a gross basis in accordance with
ifrs from an economic and legal perspective the 6 million 2011 8 interest paid fully nets off against
the same amount of interest received the amounts are not netted in the income statement because
under ifrs such offset needs in practice to be irreversibly exercised from time to time

similarly the interest paid and received on various foreign currency derivatives have been aggregated
on a gross basis while economically the 6 million of interest received 2011 3 is offset against the 19
million 2011 23 of interest paid on hedges interest paid in 2011 to postnl of 6 million and interest
received in 2011 from postnl of 5 million is also reported on a gross basis in accordance with ifrs

income taxes paid
in 2012 tnt express paid taxes for an amount of 66 million 2011 110 million

24 net cash used in investing activities 84 million 2011 158

shortterm bank balances and deposits of 8 million 2011 11 of which 6 million 2011 7 is due to
cash pools that are offset against the interest paid realised interest on foreign currency hedges of 6
million 2011 3 and interest received on taxes of 0 million 2011 2

foreign investigations
the company has received and responded to subpoenas from the united states office of foreign asset
control and voluntarily disclosed to the united states bureau of industry and security inquiring about its
involvement in exports to countries sanctioned by the united states in addition the company has
received and responded to information requests from competition authorities in various jurisdictions and
cooperated with investigations in this context tnt express does not expect any liability arising from any

financial position

29 financial risk management
no corresponding financial statement number

tnt express activities expose the company to a variety of financial risks such as market risks
including foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk all of these
risks arise in the normal course of business to manage market risks tnt express uses a variety of
financial derivatives

the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding tnt express exposure to the
financial risks described above there are certain limitations and simplifications inherent in the analyses
presented primarily due to the assumption that rates change in a parallel fashion and instantaneously
while at the same time for example the impact of changes in interest on foreign exchange exposures
and visa versa is ignored in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions
that normally would arise from the market shifts assumed

tnt express uses derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of hedging exposures the
company enters into contracts related to derivative financial instruments for periods commensurate with
its underlying exposures and does not take positions independent of these exposures none of these
financial instruments are leveraged or used for trading purposes or to take speculative positions

financial risk management is carried out by the treasury department under policies approved by the
executive board the treasury department identifies evaluates and hedges financial risk in close co
operation with operating units the executive board provides written principles for overall risk
management as well as written policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk interest
rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk periodic reporting on financial risks has been embedded in the
overall risk framework and has been provided to the executive board in a structural way

interest rate risk
part of tnt express borrowings and leases are against floating interest rates these floating interest
rates may fluctuate substantially and could have a material adverse effect on tnt express financial
results in any given reporting period borrowings that are issued at variable rates expose the company
to cash flow volatility from movements in interest risks borrowings that are issued at fixed rates expose
the company to fair value interest rate risk tnt express financial assets are on average of such short
term nature that they bear no significant fair value but do cause cash flow interest rate risks group
policy is to significantly limit the impact of interest fluctuations over a term of seven years as a
percentage of earnings before interest taxes deprecation and amortisation at 31 december 2012 tnt
express gross interest bearing borrowings including finance lease obligations totalled 236 million
2011 262 of which 187 million 2011 203 was at a fixed interest rate

although tnt express generally enters into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivatives in
order to attempt to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations these measures may be inadequate
or may subject the company to increased operating or financing costs

at 31 december 2012 if interest rates on borrowings and financial assets had been 1 higher with
other variables held constant the profit before income tax would have been 4 million higher 2011 2
equity would be impacted by 9 million 2011 9 due to the outstanding interest rate swaps with a
nominal value of us213 million and the 4 million 2011 2 impact on profit before income taxes refer

foreign currency exchange risk
tnt express operates on an international basis generating foreign currency exchange risks arising from
future commercial transactions recognised assets and liabilities investments and divestments in foreign
currencies other than the euro tnt express functional and reporting currency tnt express treasury
department matches and manages the intragroup and external financial exposures although the
company generally enters into hedging arrangements and other contracts in order to reduce its
exposure to currency fluctuations these measures may be inadequate or may subject the company to
increased operating or financing costs

management has set up a policy that requires group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk
against their local functional currency group companies are required to hedge material balance sheet
exposures via the use of foreign exchange derivatives with the treasury department whereby a
financing company operated by the treasury department trades these foreign exchange derivatives with
external banks tnt express currently has no net investment hedges outstanding significant
acquisitions and local debt is usually funded in the currency of the underlying assets

constant the profit before income tax on the foreign exchange exposure on financial instruments would

credit risk
credit risk represents the loss that the company would incur if counterparties with whom tnt express
enters into financial transactions are unable to fulfil the terms of the agreements credit risk arises from
cash and cash equivalents derivatives and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as
credit exposures relating to customers the company attempts to minimise its credit risk exposure by
only transacting with financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines and by managing its
customers portfolio tnt express continually monitors the credit standing of financial counterparties
and its customers individual risk limits are set on internal and external ratings in accordance with limits
set by the executive board the utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored at reporting date there
were no significant concentrations of credit risk the top ten customers of tnt express account for 3
of the outstanding trade receivables at 31 december 2012

liquidity risk
prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash the availability of funding through
an adequate amount of undrawn committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions
due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses tnt express attempts to maintain flexibility in
funding by keeping committed credit lines available

tnt express has central availability to the following undrawn committed facilities

outlooks on its ratings during most of 2012 reflected the expectation of the rating agents on the positive
impact of the ups merger on tnt express credit risk but these have been removed due to the
withdrawal of the offer a downgrade in the credit rating of tnt express may negatively affect its ability
to obtain funds from financial institutions retain investors and banks and increase its financing costs by
increasing the interest rates of its outstanding debt or the interest rates at which the company is able to
refinance existing debt or incur new debt this could affect its return for shareholders and benefits to
other stakeholders

drawn or undrawn committed credit facilities do not include any financial covenants there are also no
possibilities to accelerate these material debts and committed facilities in case of a credit rating

customary clauses as are generally observed in the market such as negative pledge conditions
restrictions on the use of the proceeds of the sale of assets or businesses and in most cases change

timely return to work irrespective of the cause of the absence in the event of a longterm absence a
return to work interview is held as an open discussion this provides an open forum where
management can provide support to the employee and attempt to improve the situation in many cases
the employees return to work is also closely managed by a registered medical practitioner if required

for subcontractor road traffic fatal accident information tnt express relies on subcontractors to report
fatal accidents involving their drivers and other third parties due to legal obligations and the
requirements of local authorities tnt express is unable to distinguish between blameworthy and non
blameworthy road traffic fatal accidents involving subcontractors tnt express monitors and reviews
subcontractor performance to ensure that contractual obligations with regard to safety are appropriately
implemented and maintained

the majority of the subcontractor road traffic fatal accidents in 2012 occurred in brazil and europe 
mea the reduction of subcontractor fatal accidents in asia pacific is a direct result of the divestment of
the domestic road operations in india excluding the subcontractor fatal accidents that occurred in india
in 2011 the total fatal accidents for asia pacific would have resulted in three subcontractor fatal
accidents

    for comparative purposes 2011 numbers have been restated
figures with a  fall within the reasonable assurance scope

both absolute ltas and the lta frequency rate showed a continued downward trend due to the focus
on managing safety risks and improving safety systems and processes at a local level

tnt express australia implemented the safety observation systems programme which breaks down
risk activities and improves behaviour through safety observations tnt express liège has
implemented a behaviour based safety programme to reduce the amount of accidents

hoau experienced a reduction of ltas due to its increased reliance on external resources to perform
lower skilled duties including loading and unloading operations this had previously contributed to the
significant proportion of reported ltas

the analysis of the increase in ltas in other americas has not revealed any common or consistent
underlying cause

in 2012 50 of the total co2 emissions own and subcontractors was related to road transport 47
was related to air transport and 3 to buildings tnt express is reliant on subcontractors in its business
activities capturing the data related to their activities is one of the biggest challenges in environmental
reporting the subcontractor co2 emission is calculated based on secondary indicators such as
kilometres driven and costs because of the unavailability of primary data fuel consumption of
subcontractor activities in 2012 55 of tnt express co2 footprint can be attributed to subcontractors

co2 emissions of other operations
tnt express also emits co2 as a result of business travel the co2 emissions of company cars and
business travel by air are reported

company cars and business travel by air
the lease contracts of tnt express company cars in the netherlands includes a requirement to offset
co2 emissions in 2012 the total co2 emission of all tnt express company cars was 25 ktonnes
2011 23 and a total of 18 ktonnes was offset 2011 19

tnt express managed to reduce the co2 emission related to business travel by air to 9 ktonnes 2011
12 as a result of stricter travel regulations and the use of the global video conferencing facilities

longterm trend shows that the co2 efficiency of buildings improved by 40 compared to the base year
2007 primarily due to the implementation of sustainable energy in addition the use of more efficient
aircraft boeing 747 freighters and boeing 777 freighters resulted in an improvement of 18 for
longhaul flights the efficiency of large trucks however deteriorated by 11 compared to the base year

the co2 efficiency for network flights deteriorated in 2012 while it improved for longhaul flights the
volume decrease in network flights resulted in a lower aircraft utilisation and therefore a deteriorated
co2 efficiency compared with 2011 the co2 efficiency of longhaul flights improved as a result of higher
load factors and the use of fuel efficient boeing 777 freighters

at the end of 2012 tnt express operated 51 aircraft which are separated into five operational
categories european air network ean domestic longhaul intercontinental charter not included in
the co2 efficiency index and passenger not included in the co2 efficiency index

in 2012 tnt express aviation was included in the eu emission trading scheme eu ets the eu
ets includes all flights arriving at or departing from any european union airport and addresses co2
emissions pursuant to article 3e of directive 200387ec the european commission published on 26
september 2011 the benchmark values used to allocate greenhouse gas emission allowances free of
charge to aircraft operators the co2 emission related to eu ets flights in 2012 was 639 ktonnes and
tnt express received a free allowance of approximately 576 ktonnes co2

the efficiency indicator co2 per kilometre does not reflect all improvement efforts such as improved
network optimisation and changes in capacity load factors tnt express recognises that an adjustment
is required to the efficiency indicator to properly reflect network efficiencies

in europe  mea the co2 efficiency indicator for small trucks and vans deteriorated due to the adverse
impact of a number of operational fleet changes in asia pacific the co2 efficiency improved due to the
increased use of vehicles powered by alternative fuel and the replacement of small trucks and vans

co2 efficiency improved in the other regions as a result of newly implemented initiatives such as the
deployment of onboard tracking systems and evaluation software used to improve performance
training sessions for safe and fuel efficient driving and the introduction of tricycles and electric vehicles

the co2 efficiency of buildings improved due to increased use of sustainable electricity within certain
countries for example germany and continued efforts to reduce energy consumption within a number
of entities the decline in nonallocated reflects the impact of the relocation of the tnt express head
office the green office to a building that uses sustainable energy and is completely co2 neutral

23 noise
tnt express received two noise complaints attributed to noise at depots in 2012 compared to seven in
2011

directive 200230ec known as the airport noise management directive was adopted in 2003 and
establishes rules and procedures with regard to introducing noiserelated operating restrictions at eu
airports the directive requires member states to follow the balanced approach to aircraft noise
management of the international civil aviation organisation

member states must first identify the noise problem and subsequently analyse the various measures
using four principles namely
 reduction of noise at source ie quieter aircraft
 landuse planning and management around airports
 noise abatement operating procedures
 local operating restrictions relating to noise problems

24 environmental incidents
a total of 20 environmental incidents 2011 7 were reported in 2012 with an fte coverage of 96
2011 92 the majority of the environmental incidents were caused by minor fuel leakages or
spillages all of which were dealt with appropriately to prevent further environmental impact

satisfied customers are more loyal than the lower ranked customer groups therefore tnt express
aims to increase the percentage of more than satisfied customers from within the group of least
satisfied customers understanding the mindset of less than satisfied customers and using their
feedback helps tnt express to develop strategies to improve customer retention

support continuous improvement in total tnt express received over 48500 completed surveys from
customers across all customer segments tnt express measures the percentage of customers that rate
its performance as above expectation versus those that rate its performance as below expectation this
net customer satisfaction score improved by 19 to 38 in 2012 2011 32 the driver behind this

in comparison to 2011 tnt express investments and support to partnerships reduced significantly

in 2012 wfp and tnt express evaluated their 10 year partnership during this evaluation period tnt
express and wfp agreed to minimize the number of assignments and focus on the future of the
partnership the evaluation led to a new outlook of the alliance and both organisations agreed to
continue the partnership on the basis of shared value as a result of the evaluation tnt express
reached a decision to reduce contributions related to awareness and fundraising in 2012 no corporate
cash donations were transferred to wfp nevertheless tnt express employees raised 448000 for
wfp and assisted in raising awareness to fight world hunger

tnt express partnership with north star alliance and fleet forum is related to driver health and safety
and supply chain solutions both north star alliance and fleet forum have developed dedicated
programmes to address these issues the financial support of tnt express towards these partners
remained the same in 2012

with supply chain solutions tnt express is making an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of the aid and development sector due to the fact that both tnt express and wfp agreed to minimize
the number of assignments the amount contributed to learning and development significantly reduced

corporate responsibility reporting scope

required to report cr data as from the following year tnt express entities that are divested full or
partial sale whereby tnt express no longer retains a direct or indirect controlling interest are excluded
from the cr reporting scope for the entire year in which the divestment took place

the 2012 annual report includes only cr data from entities that are fullyowned or majorityowned and
from those joint ventures where tnt express has a controlling interest with respect to corporate
responsibility the joint ventures in luxembourg and switzerland are included in the cr reporting
scope whereas png airfreight and xair services are excluded tnt express does rely on a large
number of subcontractors to perform daily activities tnt express acknowledges its responsibility and
therefore reports on the road traffic fatal accidents of its subcontractors as well as absolute
subcontractor co2 emissions which are estimated

the 2012 cr data is based on the same scope as the 2011 cr data the chinese domestic operation
hoau is sometimes excluded from the reported figures as hoau is not part of the assurance scope
this is always indicated in the tables if applicable

figures are presented in a relative way using percentages and ratios to make it possible for readers to
monitor and measure progress yearonyear unless the reporting criteria require absolute figures to be
disclosed figures related to absolute co2 emissions are all extrapolated to reflect tnt express unless
stated otherwise extrapolation for building related indicators is done on the basis of square metres co2
efficiency indicators are also presented relative to the baseline year of 2007 to show progress made
towards longterm objectives for co2 efficiency improvements wherever applicable the coverage is
defined as the number of ftes working in entities that report data divided by the total number of ftes
tnt express has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the cr information in the 2012 annual
report is accurate

certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the current years cr statement presentation

corporate responsibility assurance scope
tnt express has engaged pricewaterhousecoopers accountants nv to provide reasonable
assurance on certain 2012 cr metrics refer to assurance report 2012 and limited assurance on all
other 2012 cr metrics excluding hoau all indicators related to reasonable assurance have been
audited and are marked with a  reasonable assurance is obtained through audit work while other
elements of the report have been reviewed review work provides only limited assurance because
exhaustive gathering of evidence is not required

tnt express policy is to include acquired companies in the assurance scope three years after the year
of acquisition this policy is intended to ensure that these entities can develop their processes to report
cr data to the high standards required by tnt express and to give them time to become sufficiently
aligned with operational and other systems although hoau was acquired in 2007 other business
priorities have prevented hoau from fully implementing tnt express cr reporting requirements in
2012 hoau was recognised as an asset held for disposal for financial reporting purposes hoau is
therefore excluded from the assurance scope

the assurance work is performed in accordance with the assurance standard 3410n assurance
engagements relating to sustainability reports as drawn up by the professional body of dutch
accountants nba

as part of the external assurance engagement pricewaterhousecoopers accountants nv also makes
use of the capacity of the internal audit department of tnt express pricewaterhousecoopers
accountants nv reviews the findings of all internal audit reports and meets regularly with the
management of internal audit to discuss any findings an internal control framework is applicable for cr
reporting processes for the capture and reporting of reliable cr data

assurance report

to the executive board of tnt express nv

engagement and responsibilities
as explained in section ii of chapter 5 corporate responsibility statements we have examined the
content of chapters 3 and section ii of chapter 5 and the annexes in the annual report of tnt express
nv amsterdam tnt express hereafter referred to as cr chapters in which tnt express
renders account of the performance related to corporate responsibility cr in 2012

our examination consisted of the following combination of audit and review procedures
 audit of all data and tables related to the following key performance indicators
     the number of employees and full time equivalents employed
     the percentage of tnt express workforce at certified sites
     the number of workplace fatal accidents and road traffic fatal accidents excluding
        subcontractor fatal accidents
     the number of serious accidents
     the number of lost time accidents and the ratio of lost time accidents per 100 fte
     the absolute co2 footprint of own operations scope 1 and 2
     co2 efficiency index
     co2 efficiency of buildings
     co2 efficiency of fleet split into small trucks large trucks european air network flights
        including domestic flights and longhaul flights and
     the percentage of sustainable electricity
 review of all the other elements of the cr chapters not excluded from our assurance scope

the executive board of tnt express is responsible for the preparation of the cr chapters we are
responsible for providing an assurance report on the cr chapters

reporting criteria
tnt express developed its reporting criteria on the basis of the g31 guidelines of the global reporting
initiative gri as explained on pages 158  159 corporate responsibility reporting and assurance
scope these reporting criteria contain certain inherent limitations which may influence the reliability of
the information

the cr chapters do not cover the information for all entities of tnt express as the cr chapters only
include data from entities that are fullyowned or majorityowned and from those joint ventures where
tnt express has a controlling interest with respect to cr detailed information on the reporting scope is
given on page 158 corporate responsibility reporting and assurance scope we consider the reporting
criteria to be relevant and appropriate for our examination

scope and work performed
we planned and performed our work in accordance with dutch law including standard 3410n
assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports

audit procedures focus on obtaining reasonable assurance substantiated by sufficient and appropriate
supporting audit evidence the audited data are marked with a rhombus  review procedures focus
on obtaining limited assurance which does not require exhaustive gathering of evidence therefore
providing less assurance than audit procedures consequently we report our conclusions with respect
to the audit and review procedures separately we believe these combined procedures fulfill a rational
objective

we do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and feasibility of prospective information such as
targets expectations and ambitions included in the cr chapters

audit procedures
with regard to the audited data among other things we have gathered audit evidence as follows
 performing an external environment analysis and obtaining insight into the industry relevant social
    issues relevant laws and regulations and the characteristics of the organisation
 assessing and testing the systems and processes used for data gathering consolidation and
    validation including the methods used for calculating and estimating results




                                                                                                        160

                                                                                                    statements
                                                                                                     chapter 5



   testing the design existence and the effectiveness of the relevant internal control measures during
    the reporting period
   reconciling reported data to internal and external source documentation
   examining the existence and validity of certificates issued in respect of the management system
    standards which have been adopted by tnt express and
   performing analytical procedures relation checks and detailed checks

review procedures
our most important review procedures were
 assessing the acceptability and consistent application of the reporting policies in relation to the
    information requirements of tnt express stakeholders
 reviewing internal and external documentation to determine whether the information in the cr
    chapters is substantiated adequately
 validating and testing of the model used for estimating the co2emissions of subcontractors
 evaluating the overall presentation of the cr chapters in line with tnt express reporting criteria
 assessing the application level according to the g31 guidelines of gri

we believe that the evidence obtained from our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our conclusions

limitation in our examination
the data from huayu hengye logistics company ltd hoau china is excluded from our assurance
scope this is adequately disclosed on pages 158  159 corporate responsibility reporting and
assurance scope we have accepted this limitation in our scope because providing assurance on data
from this entity would not provide a rational objective at this stage as this entity is classified as held for
disposal

conclusions

opinion based on our audit procedures
in our opinion all data and tables marked with a rhombus  are in all material respects presented
reliably and adequately in accordance with tnt express reporting criteria

conclusion based on our review procedures
with respect to the other elements of the cr chapters not excluded from our assurance scope nothing
has come to our attention that would cause us to conclude that the cr chapters in all material respects
do not provide a reliable and adequate presentation of the cr policy of tnt express or of the cr
related performance during the reporting year in accordance with tnt express reporting criteria
