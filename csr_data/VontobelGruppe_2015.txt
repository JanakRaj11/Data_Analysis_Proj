sustainability on the move


sustainability remained a topic of discussion in the financial markets in 2014 although
progress has been made on a number of fronts such as the increased integration of
sustainability themes in financial analysis there is still a need for further action in
other areas


the organization swiss sustainable finance was established in 2014 to highlight swiss
strengths in this field and to provide instruments to further intensify the focus on
sustainability criteria within the industry vontobel played a key role in setting up swiss
sustainable finance and hosts the organization we are convinced that promoting
a sustainable approach within the financial industry will offer a means of harnessing
an important trend thus opening up new and sustainable growth areas


sustainability is also a topic of debate internationally the most recent example is the
montreal carbon pledge launched at the principles for responsible investment
pri conference major institutional investors that have taken the pledge are calling
for the improved measurement of the risks associated with climate change in invest
ment strategies the guiding principle for the financial sector worldwide must be to
create transparency and take appropriate action


vontobels activities in the area of sustainability were geared towards achieving this
in 2014 as part of our transition to the latest version of the global reporting initiative
sustainability reporting guidelines g4 we focused more intensively on the principle
of materiality when selecting our sustainability indicators for the first time the full
sustainability report is contained in this section of the annual report we are also
endeavouring to ensure that sustainability is even more firmly integrated into our
everyday business activities than before to this end we further expanded our efforts
relating to citizenship in 2014 to enable us to strategically promote projects with
a thematic link to the financial sector in the future in terms of employee development
we took seriously and addressed the points raised in the 2013 employee survey we
improved internal communications by holding regular town hall meetings and the
processes for focused career development have been optimized


it is our clients in particular who should benefit from our commitment to sustaina
bility our specialists at various international locations are constantly identifying and
analysing trends using their findings to deliver innovative investment strategies and
products the successes we have achieved such as being named best private bank
in switzerland by the swiss business magazine bilanz and our performance in the
swiss derivative awards are a source of further motivation in this context

unless stated otherwise the report boundary encompasses the vontobel group with
all its locations and the subsidiaries listed in the consolidated annual financial statements
as a provider of financial products we also seek to incorporate sustainability aspects in
our products and services as well as in our partnerships and relationships with suppliers
more detailed information can be found in the following sections g420 21 infor
mation on the scope of consolidation can be found on page 200201 of the annual
report g417


open dialogue is important to us in order to gain a better understanding of the needs
of our clients employees suppliers and cooperation partners and to take account of
the concerns of local communities and nongovernmental organizations we want to
engage with our stakeholders by providing clear and comprehensible information on the
different challenges and opportunities relating to environmental social and governance
esg issues regular surveys among our employees and clients are key tools in this
context as are specific discussions with our suppliers in the year under review we
implemented measures based on the results of the 2013 employee and client survey
issues raised by employees included calls for enhanced internal communication and
targeted support in the area of career development the majority of clients indicated
they were very satisfied with vontobel but we nonetheless want to achieve improve
ments in this area and further strengthen client trust in our company g424 25 26 27


focusing on clients
our business philosophy is centred on achieving client satisfaction and on gaining and
maintaining client trust this task has become more complex in view of the increasing
demands being placed on the financial sector and more stringent regulatory require
ments both in switzerland and worldwide at the same time clients have become
more discerning and the demand for individually tailored solutions has increased sus
tainability aspects are playing a more significant role in this context even purely in
terms of economic risk considerations


offering each of our clients the right product or best possible service is therefore the
primary task of our three business units  private banking asset management and
investment banking private banking offers a comprehensive range of services to
address a wide variety of financial matters from portfolio management to investment
advice and inheritance planning asset management has a multiboutique approach
with five independent centres of competence and focuses on active asset management
investment banking ranks among the leading issuers of derivatives and structured
products in switzerland and europe our range of services is rounded off with secu
rities and forex trading as well as the securities services provided by transaction
banking compliance with the product naming requirements defined by regulators is
mandatory for all our business units as well as being one of the leading issuers of
structured products in switzerland we play a pioneering role in this business since
1 october 2014 vontobel financial products has also been transparently disclosing
the issuer margin of its own structured products in addition to the distribution fees
thus setting a new industry standard in terms of cost transparency




                                                                                                 vontobel group annual report 2014   5

                                        equally vontobel assigns the highest importance to protecting client data and to com
                                        plying with all the statutory provisions the legal  compliance department is respon
                                        sible for regulating and monitoring both of these aspects throughout vontobel there
                                        were no cases involving the violation of client privacy in 2014


                                        in private banking the individual service offered by vontobel forms the cornerstone
                                        our good relationship with clients our relationship managers take time to understand
                                        the wishes and needs of each client and make a structured assessment of their personal
                                        circumstances in order to offer them services that are tailored to their individual
                                        requirements to ensure that our clients only purchase products that are suitable and
                                        appropriate for them in terms of their personal financial market experience and risk
                                        c apacity the new risk profile that was developed in 2013 was further enhanced to
                                        take into account specific market requirements this enables relationship managers to
                                        issue investment recommendations that are in line with the risk profile of the client in
                                        question incorporating both their personal experience and the expected development
                                        of the market this makes it possible to address our clients and their needs more specif
                                        ically we conduct a survey of our private clients every two years where possible the
                                        2013 survey indicated that client satisfaction was already high at 84 and our goal is
                                        to continue to achieve improvements in this area


                                        vontobel began to introduce retrocessionfree share classes in portfolio management
                                        in 2013 and systematically pursued these efforts in 2014 this measure is partly aimed
                                        at further enhancing cost transparency in portfolio management mandates and is also
                                        a key factor with regard to client satisfaction retrocessionfree investment funds have
                                        been gradually phased in taking into account the available investment opportunities


                                        to ensure that our relationship managers are ideally prepared to meet the needs of our
                                        clients we again invested in a range of training programmes in 2014 the focus here
                                        was primarily on specialist expertise and advisory skills our elearning platform has
                                        proved to be an effective tool that can be used across different countries opportunities

longterm succession planning that addresses the needs of the business units is an
essential part of vontobels longterm planning in the area of human resources
particular attention is paid here to promoting team diversity the number of differ
ent nationalities was largely stable in 2014 compared with the previous year the age
structure shows that most employees are aged between 30 and 50 years old
targeted support is an important factor in aligning the potential of this age group
with the staffing needs of the business units


in 2014 training and education measures therefore focused on redesigning the lead
ership curriculum the range of sales training programmes negotiating skills and
employee onboarding the latter was further enhanced with the vontobel ambassa

addition to key products and services meanwhile the vontobel academy once
again offered a wide range of internal and external courses in 2014 covering
specialist subjects personal development and leadership expenditure on training
increased year on year as a result both in absolute terms and per employee


in addition to structured employee development vontobel is committed to offering
attractive working conditions one example is the promotion of a healthy worklife
balance the benefits granted to working parents go beyond the statutory minimum
in terms of both maternity and paternity leave after completing six years of service
female employees benefit from six months of maternity leave on full pay while mem

the payment of salaries and the provision of financial services to private and institu
