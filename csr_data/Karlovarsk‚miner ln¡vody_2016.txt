 environment


       protecting the springs
       pumping water from the depths of nature
       entails responsibility towards the springs
       environment and the mineral water itself

       environment over the last ten years

       by as much as twenty percent for the
       mattoni mineral water we are doing this
       through innovation costsaving measures
       more efficient energy management or
       transportation by rail which can fully replace
       road transport

       the industrial rail built already by heinrich
       mattoni in 1894 which connected the
       municipality of kyselka with the european
       railway network restoration of the original

       of the environment and reduced the number
       of trucks on the roads by 3700 every year
