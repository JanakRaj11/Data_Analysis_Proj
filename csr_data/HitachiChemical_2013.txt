       new mediumterm management plan fiscal 20132015
       guided by its corporate vision the hitachi chemical group formulated a new threeyear mediumterm management plan to steer
       management and business decisions in each fiscal year of the plan next we reflect on the previous mediumterm management plan
       that ran from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2012 and then discuss the new mediumterm management plan that started in fiscal 2013




                        review of previous mediumterm management plan fiscal 20102012
                        although targets were achieved in fiscal 2010 the first year of the plan net sales and operating income fell
                        short of our forecasts for fiscal 2011 owing to the great east japan earthquake nuclear reactor meltdowns and
                        flooding in thailand and for fiscal 2012 owing to weak demand in the pc and other electronics markets and
                        automotiverelated industries although these external factors had a significant impact the hitachi chemical
                        group also lacked the ability and agility to create new products and businesses and was unable to fully tap into
                        demand in emerging countries a key driver of growth in the high functional materials and automotive parts
