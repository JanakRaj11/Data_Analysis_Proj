that engagement to help develop our initial prioritization of sustainability issues

expectations people have and how we are              priorities emerged in the years ahead we look

all our sustainability work begins with the
premise that we pursue sustainability initiatives
in order to better serve our residents and their
families for us a central part of how we define
sustainability includes its social component
we are committed to helping our residents
continue to live with meaning therefore to
be truly sustainable at brookdale we create
caring healthy and supportive situations for
our residents and their families both now
and for generations to come a key part of
this is engaging our residents in the work of
sustainability helping them contribute to a
greater good and live with purpose

people                                             our sustainability roadmap includes several
                                                    key initiatives that involve our suppliers
engaging our suppliers                              to begin we are asking key suppliers to be
while we are highly focused on what is              proactive in improving our performance in our
happening within our own four walls we are       three priority environmental improvement areas
also excited about engaging our suppliers to help   energy water waste based on the specific
drive our sustainability improvements              products or processes they provide for us
                                                    we are tracking these improvements within

                                                    based on our sustainability criteria and planning

                                                    lead the way in achieving major sustainability
                                                    related results over time we are targeting to
                                                    partner with suppliers to codevelop innovative
                                                    approaches and integrated solutions




                                                      in 2015 brookdale and its coffee

                                                       eliminated over

were increasing our commitment to purchasing with sustainability as a major part
of the criteria
we are now working with key suppliers on increasing the sustainability attributes of our
procurement some of our suppliers are working with us on superior products others are
helping us improve our operating processes related to product use still others are helping
us manage waste recycling and final disposal while some are even working with us on
fundamental product process and operations design


heres an example of progress with a major provider of unit turnover and refurbishing supply

   2015  watersense certified products
            51 of showerheads brookdale purchased were watersense certified
            79 of toilets brookdale purchased were watersense certified




we have begun thoughtful
collaboration on sustainability
with our suppliers
in 2015 in line with our sustainability
implementation roadmap we did all the
advance work to prepare to bring our
key suppliers together for a sustainability
summit which we held in january 2016
we are now working with those suppliers
to develop and implement innovative
sustainabilitydriven breakthroughs




                                                                                                23

the second major stream of work in our sustainability journey is reducing environmental impact in all
the places where we operate sustainability requires understanding and lowering our environmental
footprint and for us at brookdale this is a central focus in our sustainability roadmap


after careful analysis we prioritized three         are the most important ones in which we must
environmental areas  energy water waste          drive improvement energy consumption water
and built a foundation for reliable improvement      use and waste
based on reviews of our key stakeholders

environmental impacts and consideration of our      energy  utility manager  to focus specifically
business priorities we determined three areas       on energy and water reduction efforts in 2015




as of dec 31 2015 brookdale owns
or manages more than 1100 communities
totaling over 87 million square feet so our
environmental impact is significant to make
systematic progress in reducing that impact as
part of our sustainability roadmap in 2015 we
    assessed integrated and improved all our
     measurement capabilities
    comprehensively understood our true
     baseline performance
    carefully determined which environmental
     areas were most significant and
    set prioritized improvement goals
as we move into 2016 we are focused on
specific capital investments and vigorous
improvement activities designed to achieve
meaningful progress in reducing our most
significant environmental impacts

         places  driving breakthrough improvements in energy water waste



throughout 2015 we achieved a variety of            our costs our residents their families our
meaningful environmental improvements                associates the environment and the bottom
while we focused throughout 2015 on the              line all could not be happier
meticulous but critical work of developing our
measurement systems and crafting thorough
implementation plans we also continued our
efforts on the ground to directly reduce our
environmental impacts here are examples of
the kinds of projects weve been undertaking
and the progress weve achieved


led lighting retrofits
after completing a 6 million portfoliowide
cfl lighting retrofit in 201314 we began pilot
projects for led lighting in 2015 that led to
led retrofits in more than 80 communities

warmer brighter safer much more pleasing our     72000000 gallons of water across all our
residents are finding the new lighting to be truly   communities nationwide from 2012 to 2014 our
remarkable and beyond that obvious win in           water leak reporting protocol alone resulted in
terms of how we live our daily lives we are also    savings of more than 1 million and prevented
reducing environmental impact by lowering our        the loss of truly significant amounts of water
energy consumption 25  as well as reducing



                     across all the brookdale communities that
              completed led retrofitting in 2015 the average
                reduction in electricity costs was
                                                               218

environmentally superior fixtures and materials            accounts payable to drive the reduction of
as part of expanding redeveloping and                   paper invoices and disbursements of checks
maintaining our communities we have increased             reductions are achieved through converting
our use of attic insulation heat reflective roofing       suppliers to electronic invoicing shifting paper
materials watersense fixtures and energy star          invoices to email and launching a campaign
rated appliances all of which reduce water and            to increase electronic payments the goal for
energy consumption for designated areas of                accounts payable is to be paperless by the end
our communities we now specify the use of anti           of 2016 extensive efforts already undertaken

we have implemented computer recycling                     successfully implemented printing scanning
programs through which all hard disks are                  and communications practices that have
processed by a recycler for data destruction              reduced or eliminated printing saved paper
and all of our mobile devices are recycled                 and improved printer energy efficiencies



        we are also targeting our transportation impact
        although brookdale does not consume a great deal of gasoline and diesel fuel we do operate
        passenger vehicles and small vans and buses at our communities in 2015 our entire enterprise
        consumed 1086311 gallons of gasoline and 13993 gallons of diesel fuel so this is an area we are
        targeting for improvement we are currently finalizing our transportation data collection system the
        reporting status of vehicles that are allocated to different communities in which we have different
        ownership proportions and the development of sustainabilityrelated fleet policies once those
        are complete they will all be used in conjunction with our existing maintenance protocols service
        parameters and inspection logs to establish formal baselines and set specific improvement targets



                                                                                                                29

have alzheimers disease or another form of
dementia including many of our residents we
are committed to the effort to end alzheimers
and have had a longstanding relationship with
the alzheimers association in their fight to cure
and control the disease while enhancing care for
those who live with it

association we made history in both 2014
and 2015 our associates residents and
business partners across the country rallied
to this cause leading and participating in a
variety of fundraising activities including the
annual walk to end alzheimers the worlds
largest event to generate awareness and funds
for alzheimers care support and research
because of these efforts by associates residents
and business partners brookdales nationwide
participation in the alzheimers associations
walk to end alzheimers generated more than
2 million in 2015 reaching platinum status this
