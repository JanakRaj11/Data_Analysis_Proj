this role we complement other organizations through our
expertise in the field of sustainability
   another development that has accelerated rapidly in re
cent years is the introduction of growing and increasingly
complex regulation that is affecting financial institutions
like sek there is a strong interest in and need for trying to
use regulation to remove those problems that led to the 2008
financial crisis especially in light of the financial markets
own inability to resolve these problems for a relatively small
organization like sek efforts to integrate these new regula
tions into the companys operations have come to account
for a large proportion of costs and they place constant pres
sure on resources
   the eus new crd iv regulation which affects various
factors for sek including the work of the board also pres
ents new challenges if crd iv is translated word for word
into swedish law it will involve significant changes for ex
ample it will mean that a european legal tradition of other
principles of accountability will be introduced into swedish
law but above all it will mean that riskrelated issues that
were previously managed at an operational level will in
creasingly become the responsibility of the board of direc
tors if regulations force boards to recruit primarily on the
basis of the ability to micromanage operational riskrelated
issues there is a danger that this will take priority over stra
tegic matters which are the most important task of a board           we are delighted to have found such a person in catrin

  sek wants to highlight and clarify the significance
  of exports for the swedish economy and to increase un
  derstanding of the importance of financing in export
  transactions financing in particular financing on good
  terms is a factor that can ultimately determine in what
  country a company bases its production for this reason
  we launched our export credit trends survey in 2013
  which aims to reflect export and financing trends the
  survey is based on interviews with a statistically signifi
  cant sample of exporters

  the export credit trends survey provides us with a
  view of companies experience of demand which is a use
  ful economic indicator it also gives us an idea of compa
  nies financing needs and their access to the credit capital
  and banking markets while highlighting other factors
  that can have an impact on companies exports such as

 peter yngwe on his
 thirty years at sek
 peter yngwe is leaving sek after 30 years he joined the
 company in 1984 and became company president in
 1997 here he answers questions about his time at sek

 how has sek and its role developed over those 30
 years
 both sek and swedish business have seen phenomenal
 development during that time sek has always played
 an important role for swedish exports but we have seen
 quite a change over the past 20 years we have gone from
 receiving orders on a regulated market where we were of
 ten the last to be involved in financing discussions to be
 ing a commercial operator on an open market where we
 are often involved from the very beginning and regularly
 structure transactions ourselves

 so is sek now a completely different organization
 both yes and no weve developed the way we work in a
 very farreaching and proactive way but our mission to
 support swedish exports through financial solutions re

         meant that creativity is more controlled                           in practice this issue was resolved when the banks sold
                                                                             their stakes

         sek is now an organization that works more closely with             with the company
         clients we visit customers to explain how sek can sup             obviously ive also experienced a few negative things
         port swedish exports through our complementary role to              there have been some people who have not done what
         banks in the past we received orders at the final stage of         we agreed and shook hands over people who try to take
         discussions today we are involved from start to finish in          advantage of others it hasnt happened often but when it
         many transactions                                                  does happen its very disappointing but the opposite can

         how did that come about                                            in the early 1990s nothing was working the swedish
         it really all started with the swedish banking crisis in the        banking system was in meltdown the market ground to
         1990s when banks started reforming their operations               a halt and no one knew how to handle all the outstanding
         including the ownership of sek at that time there was              reciprocal transactions but institutions in the swedish
         also a government enquiry on export credit which also              banking market settled up with one another and people
         reviewed seks business the banks concluded that it                were as good as their word no one took advantage of the
         was difficult for them to both own us and as they saw it          situation the problem was solved in the best way for all
         compete with us there was only one solution and my first           parties involved thats the gentlemanly way to do things
         task was therefore to demonstrate the rational reasons for
         the banks to sell their stakes which they eventually did          what has been the significance of this type of positive
                                                                             behavior
         what impact did that have on sek                                   im proud to have been a part of that culture and without

         the owners at that time we had no business plan so                ior through regulation and obviously sometimes that is
         i developed the first one we set out what needed to be             whats needed but its not necessarily a good thing when

               in 2013 sek experienced continued strong demand
               from the swedish export sector total new lending
               amounted to skr 557 billion of which skr 390 billion
               consisted of endcustomer finance and skr 167 bil
               lion was made up of corporate lending


               traditionally sek is an institution that experiences
               greatest demand and its largest volumes at times of financial
               crises when other institutions withdraw the financial mar
               kets were volatile during the year but economic conditions
               have stabilized and large companies with good credit qual
               ity had good access to other sources of finance including the
               capital market it was therefore not certain that sek would
               be able to achieve high volumes but in 2013 sek still expe
               rienced significant demand for its services and lending vol
               umes were high
                  this high demand is due to a number of factors first nu
               merous export sales are taking place that require longterm
               financing sek is involved in providing financing for many
               of these transactions through our complementary role to
               banks and our ability to offer lending in different curren
               cies second we now have many more clients awareness of

               ber of clients has doubled since then third this strong de
               mand has also been boosted by companies need for working
               capital finance especially for companies that do not have the
               same access to the capital market as larger companies
                  sek will also continue to take a proactive approach and
               develop its products and services in order to provide the best
               financing solutions for swedish companies increased risk
               capacity is one of the key factors that enables sek to create
               greater opportunities to assist the swedish export industry
               sek has therefore started using insurance companies to mit
               igate risk providing more opportunities to help exporters
               sek already cooperates with local banks in sweden which
               can lend to small and medium enterprises smes that sek
               does not reach in 2013 we signed equivalent agreements
               with local and regional banks around the world enabling
               sek to finance swedish export transactions via these banks
               in 2013 sek also provided working capital finance to end
               customers purchasing swedish goods and services
                  sek undertakes active sustainability measures relating to
               our lending to ensure that our financing goes to projects that
               meet international social and environmental standards

projects in countries with a particularly high risk of human
rights breaches and corruption projects in sensitive areas
and projects in countries where it is difficult for exporters
to access information in 2013 we continued training seks
transaction managers in sustainable financing methods and
where necessary we use sustainability analysts to carry out
indepth reviews and site visits we also set requirements

   during the year sek launched a financing solution that
benefits swedish companies exports to the major aircraft
manufacturers airbus and boeing a couple of percent of
each of their planes is made up of swedish components and
services seks financing of a number of entire planes so that
these aircraft manufacturers purchase more components
from sweden increases the likelihood of a large number of
swedish subcontractors being able to sell their products and

   to funding from capital markets around the world many investors view sek as a safe investment option
   during the international financial and debt crisis that is still continuing in different parts of the world

               to approximately usd 15 billion compared with new fund
               ing of just over usd 6 billion in 2012 this was due in part to
               sek having around double the volume of early redemptions
               of bonds in 2013 compared with a normal year and healthy
               new lending which created a greater need for borrowing

               in 2014 this is partly due to sek having been able to issue

               maturity
                  structured funding increased in terms of actual numbers
               in 2013 but it decreased as a percentage of total borrowing
               during the year owing mainly to large volumes of early re

changes in risk exposure are an increase of credit spread risk attributed to classification of new liquidity

the risk framework for operational risk and has defined risk appetite for losses from incidents as well as
for which types of incidents that typically fall outside the risk appetite sek has also decided on criteria

seks risk management primarily involves using various techniques to transform and reduce gross risks into
net risks that are at levels that are sustainable in the long term in relation to seks risk capital the matrix below
describes managements view on risk management for seks operational and financial risks for information on
sustainability risks see page 82

   gross exposure
   credit risk
   some of seks credits are granted to parties that have lower credit quality and therefore higher risk than sek
   wishes to be exposed to this applies to a large extent to export credits for which the ability to provide financing is
   a key competitive tool for suppliers even in cases where customers have good credit quality the gross risks can be
   higher than is desirable if the financing requirements are substantial gross exposures do not take into account any
   risk mitigationrisk diversification to meet seks policy for liquidity and funding risk borrowed funds not yet
   used to finance credits need to be invested in securities known as liquidity placements




   counterparty risk in derivative transactions
   various derivative transactions such as swaps forward contracts and options are used to limit and reduce risks the
   value of these transactions can be considerable in the event of market changes particularly for transactions with
   long maturities this gives rise to a counterparty risk in derivative transactions for which realization of the value
   of such transactions depends on the counterpartys ability to meet its obligations throughout the entire contract
   period counterparty risk in derivative transactions is a form of credit risk

   market risks  interest rates
   in order to be able to offer credits  often with complex disbursement and repayment structures  with fixed interest
   at attractive terms it is costefficient for sek to take on some interest rate risk seks borrowing is also often made
   at fixed interest sek primarily sets interest rate terms based on the various needs and preferences of customers and
   counterparties consequently assets and liabilities can to some extent have different fixed interest periods which
   lead to interest rate risk

   market risks  currency
   seks lending and a large proportion of its borrowing can take place in the currencies chosen by the borrower and
   investor respectively it seldom happens that borrowing and lending are made in the same currency and therefore
   directly balance each other liquidity placements and some borrowing may insofar as market conditions allow be
   made in the currencies sek chooses in order to match assets and liabilities



   market risks  other
   a large portion of seks funding is carried out on terms that are adapted to investor requirements regarding ex
   posure to different risks such adjustments provide exposure not only to credit risk but also to changes in different
   marketrelated variables such as interest rates and commodity and equity indices



   liquidity and funding risk
   seks customers require credits in different currencies with different maturities maturities are often long




   operational risk
   seks transactions often have long maturities and a high degree of complexity which creates operational risk the ex
   tensive risk management carried out by sek for different types of risk is often complex and therefore leads to additional
   operational risk
