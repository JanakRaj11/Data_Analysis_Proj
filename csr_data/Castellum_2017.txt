rental income in pace with new tenancies and thereby
further improved profit from property management

       new infrastructure for efficient
       goods flows
       the development of faster better and smarter logistics is driven by global trends
       such as the growing urbanisation with more and more people in our urban areas
       new consumption and purchasing patterns greater interest in the environment and
       the technical development that allows better transparency and efficiency
