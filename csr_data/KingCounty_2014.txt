introduction

king county places a high priority on reducing the environmental footprint of county
operations and supporting efforts in the broader community to improve environmental
sustainability the county is also committed to monitoring environmental outcomes relative
to its goals and targets being transparent about results and using this information to
inform course corrections

king county code kcc 1850010 requires annual reporting on the countys climate
change energy green building and environmental purchasing programs this report is
intended to satisfy this reporting requirement and provide performance information relative
to related goals and targets as well as challenges opportunities and recommendations

the countys overarching climate goal is to partner with its residents businesses local
governments and other partners to reduce countywide greenhouse gas ghg emissions by
at least 80 percent below 2007 levels by 2050 in 2012 the king county executive and
king county council collaborated to develop and adopt a strategic climate action plan
scap the scap synthesizes and focuses king countys most critical goals objectives
and strategies to reduce ghg emissions and prepare for the impacts of climate change an
updated plan is now being developed and will be transmitted to the king county council by
june 2015 this update will also formally combine and integrate the king county energy
plan and the scap

the scap reflects king countys longstanding commitments to environmental sustainability
and economic prosperity it builds upon diverse climate change and sustainability related
commitment and is organized around five goal areas transportation and land use energy
and green building forests and agriculture consumption and materials management and
preparing for climate change impacts

beginning with the 2012 report progress has been reported using the framework of the
five major goal areas for the scap and summarizing information related to both county
operations and service to the broader community using this framework helps organize
reporting on these diverse but related topics

    2013 performance snapshot  how are we doing
    overarching ghg emissions reduction targets1 king countys latest assessment of ghg
    emissions documented a per capita decline in core ghg emissions for the average king
    county resident driven primarily by declines in perperson vehicle travel and building energy
    use however total overall ghg emissions in king county continued to increase while
    progress is being made after years of continued growth in emissions the region is currently
    not on track to meet its longterm ghg reduction targets as it relates to climate pollution
    from king county government operations total annual greenhouse gas ghg emissions
    related to energy fossil fuels and electricity decreased approximately 55 percent between
    2007 and 2013

    during this period the countys facility related ghg emissions have fallen by roughly
    18 percent total ghg emissions from county vehicles have remained flat during this period
    while significant progress has been made to make the countys fleets more efficient increased
    transit service offset the reduction in total ghg emissions from county vehicles it is
    important to note that increased transit service plays a significant role in reducing community
    scale ghg emissions ghg reduction benefits from increased transit are estimated to be
    approximately 4 times the direct ghg footprint of metro transits operations by decreasing
    congestion reducing car trips and allowing more efficient land use

    transportation and land use in 2013 king county metro transit had more than 122 million
    annual boardings on transit and vanpools and ridership on all public transportation services in
    king county hit an alltime record high of 1482 million boardings transit vehicle energy use
    per passenger capacity has improved by approximately 7 percent since 2007

    energy and green building the recent success of king countys energy and green building
    efforts continued in 2013 currently the equivalent of 549 percent of king county
    governments total energy requirements are being met by the generation or consumption of
    renewable energy exceeding the countys 50 percent renewable energy target king county
    also achieved an 85 percent normalized energy use reduction for facilities between 2007
    and 2013 in 2013 98 percent of king county capital projects either pursued leadership in
    energy and environmental design leed certification or utilized a sustainable infrastructure
    scorecard that guides assessment of energy and resource efficient alternatives at the
    community level the county advanced work on regional green building codes in partnership
    with cities and the building community in december 2013 king county approved a
    significant update to its green building ordinance that raises the bar for performance for
    all county infrastructure and buildings and integrated new green building commitments for
    affordable housing

    forests and agriculture in 2013 king county made continued progress in adding to
    conservation acreage through the open space and forest land current use taxation programs
    agricultural land preservation conservation easements and forest planning and stewardship
    highlights included the purchase of the 200 acre tall chief property in the snoqualmie valley
    which will bring high quality agricultural soils back into production and prevent conversion to
    development implementation of forest stewardship plans on king county parks including
    at the danvillegeorgetown forest and restoration of the maury island marine park including

planting more than 100000 native trees and shrubs in august 2013 king county voters
approved the 20142019 king county parks trails and open space replacement levy by
70 percent which will help support implementation of the strategic climate action plan
forestry and trailrelated commitments

consumption and materials management king county residents and businesses continued to
recycle or compost more than half of all waste a significant achievement its estimated that
this recycling reduced ghg emissions by more than 13 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent or the same as removing more than 200000 passenger vehicles from the road
king county supported these achievements through diverse solid waste and recyclingrelated
policies planning and infrastructure investments including through its recycle more its
easy to do campaign and the food too good to waste outreach programs king county also
made significant progress at reducing operational resource related impacts for example king
county reduced copy paper usage by 21 percent between 2010 and 2013 achieving savings of
approximately 209860 over that period

preparing for climate change impacts the county has developed programs and projects to
help reduce the impacts of floods support farm and forest owner action to address climate
change impacts and begin to prepare the region for the effects of climate change on stormwa
ter public health and emergency response however much work remains to tackle the signif
icant impacts of climate change in king county 2013 highlights included completion of the
largest inriver flood protection project since establishment of the king county flood district in
2007 factoring climate change into emergency management planning for the first time and
the wastewater treatment divisions making significant progress in evaluating and reducing sea
level rise impacts to wastewaterrelated infrastructure

these are just some of the highlights provided in this report the strategic climate action
plan  2013 progress report snapshot on the next page provides a visual overview of
progress toward the five goal areas of the scap followed by a more detailed assessment for
each goal area

king county is required by council ordinance 17270 to conduct a comprehensive update of
the scap by june 30 2015 ordinance requirements for the update include work to further
identify community level actions the county can take to reduce climate pollution and prepare
for the impacts of climate change and direction to formally combine and integrate the king
county energy plan into the scap

looking forward to 2014 and 2015 the county is increasing collaborative work with cities to
establish a shared countywide target and measurement framework for reducing greenhouse
gas emissions and engaging cities through the king countycities climate collaboration to
commit to specific actions to reduce communityscale greenhouse gas emissions the county
is working hard to both walk the talk to become more sustainable in its operations as well as
to partner with businesses cities utilities and the public to help achieve the deep reductions
in communitylevel greenhouse gas emissions that need to be made

transportation and land use

background
transportation accounts for nearly half of all ghg emissions produced in king county
managing growth and providing transportation options in our region can increase the
use of public transportation reduce ghg emissions from single occupancy vehicle
usage and traffic congestion and create more walkable transitsupportive urban
communities in 2010 the puget sound regional council psrc set regional
transportation and environmental goals in the transportation 2040 plan to meet the
goals of the transportation 2040 plan public transportation must serve the travel needs
of approximately twice as many people in 2040 as in 2010 to serve that many additional
people the region needs to provide a wide range of transportation options including bus
vanpool carpool carshare bikeshare bicycling and walking

king county government influences transportationrelated ghg emissions by providing
public transit commuter vans and ridesharing services and supporting walking and
bicycling alternatives  choices that eliminate or shorten private vehicle trips mitigate
traffic congestion and support efficient land use metro transit is the regions largest transit
system with 1222 million boardings on more than 215 bus routes and commuter vans

the county also has an extensive regional trails system with over 175 miles of trails which
provide recreational and transportation options king countys growth management and
landuse regulations encourage efficient landuse patterns which provide opportunities for
walking and bicycling king county also operates an extensive vehicle fleet that supports
government operations the county is continually working to reduce ghg emissions and
is phasing in more fuel efficient and alternative fueled vehicles king countys strategic
plan and scap set the direction for our actions on climate change these plans include
strategies to focus transportation resources to support density and growth and to enhance
bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure as alternative transportation options and to better
connect regional trails to the bus train and ferry networks in the region progress toward
these strategies will also serve the countys scap transportation and land use goals

progress was made in several areas during 2013 toward the longterm goals of the scap
and county strategic plan metro transit ridership has recovered to prerecession levels
with over 1222 million boardings on transit and commuter vans overall ridership in the
county including sound transit express operated by metro transit community transit
express link sounder king county commuter van program accessible services
and passengeronly ferries set a record with over 1482 million rides on all public
transportation services ridership growth is attributed to a combination of growing

                                             employment and service improvements including rapidride metro transit has also
                                             become more efficient through efforts such as service restructuring and increased use of
                                             orca cards other programs and actions such as the addition of vans and electric cars
                                             to the commuter van program and bike facility investments will all support a continued
                                             reduction in the drivealone rate meanwhile significant advancements in fuel efficiency
                                             and new technologies are beginning to reduce net fuel consumption for king county buses

     metro transit partners with local communities to encourage residents to use healthier travel
     options like the bus carpooling bicycling and walking through the in motion program in
     2013 the in motion team took on two projects to improve program effectiveness a complete
     evaluation of the program and development of a unique approach to working with multifamily
     residences key recommendations from the program evaluation included updating the program
     brand and use of technology to be more contemporary deepening engagement with limited
     english population lep communities expanding the role of championscommunity advocates
     and implementing a legacy survey component to track long term change in travel behavior

     in partnership with the seattle department of transportation a multifamily project will
     test varied levels of property manager involvement at six buildings in the south lake union
     and bitter lake neighborhoods these projects will be implemented in spring 2014 three
     neighborhoodlevel in motion projects are also planned for 2014 one along the e line and
     two more in the burientukwila and renton neighborhoods these projects will apply several of
     the recommendations from the program review and will feature online interactive maps more
     effective engagement with lep households and a branding refresh of program materials and
     the website the in motion program will also serve as the centerpiece of metro transits i405

     2013 status
     net vehicle fleet energy consumption decreased by 33 percent between 2007 and 2013
     significant reductions in fuel use were achieved in a number of areas most notable are the
     reductions in fuel use for the countys passenger vehicle and light truck fleets total fuel use by
     the countys general fleet declined 12 percent between 2007 and 2013 due to the continued

     use for increased ridership metro transit saw a 3 percent reduction in total fuel use from 2007
     to 2013 fuel consumption by the solid waste fleet continues to decline as a result of the
     ability to optimize semitrailer hauling weights from the transfer stations to the landfill

2013 key accomplishments
hybrid fleet expansion
metro transit took delivery of 43 60foot articulated hybrid buses in 2013 by the end
of 2013 approximately 52 percent of metro transits bus fleet was composed of diesel
electric hybrid buses the new dieselelectric hybrid buses are approximately 30 percent
more energy and ghg efficient than the diesel buses that were replaced

in addition to the purchase of hybrid buses metro transit is also purchasing hybrid support
vehicles in 2013 metro transit purchased four hybrid vehicles and since 2007 metro
transit has purchased a total of 59 hybrid vehicles this is 18 percent of all support vehicle
purchases


carrying more people more efficiently
the average fuel efficiency miles per gallon of metro transits bus fleet has remained
relatively steady in recent years this is mainly because even though older diesel buses
have been replaced by newer more fuelefficient dieselelectric hybrids 40foot highfloor
coaches have been replaced by 60foot lowfloor articulated coaches that consume more
fuel on a pervehicle basis offsetting the hybrids efficiency gains

fortunately the 60foot buses carry about one third more passengers than the 40foot
coaches and greatly increase the overall ridership capacity necessary to achieve metro
transits ridership growth targets when evaluated in terms of passenger capacity rather
than vehicle miles fleet fuel efficiency improved by approximately 7 percent since 2007


consistent fleet standards
king county fleet managers continue to work together in developing and implementing
uniform standards for lightduty vehicles in order to minimize lifecycle costs the standards
for the various types of business needs include service intervals optimum and maximum
lifecycle and new vehicle purchases in 2013 the group also explored joint purchasing
opportunities for biodiesel and arranged to have presentations on compressed natural gas
and liquefied petroleum gas from industry experts to determine the current state of these
alternative fuels and assess the extent to which either fuel might be suitable for the various
applications in the countys lightduty fleets the goal is to provide the most cost effective
solution for providing the large variety of county services while reducing the carbon
footprint of the countys lightduty fleet


lightduty hybrid vehicle purchases
of the 205 lightduty vehicles purchased by fleet administration and solid waste divisions
in 2013 78 were hybrid vehicles or 38 percent of the total lightduty vehicles purchased
for the year thirteen of the 78 replaced existing hybrids and 65 or 62 percent replaced
regular internal combustion engine vehicles

     for more than five years metro transit has taken extraordinary actions to preserve bus
     service while experiencing a 12 billion shortfall in sales tax revenue caused by the
     recession metro transit cut more than 100 staff positions improved operating efficiency
     raised fares five times dug into reserve funds and took many other steps to save or raise
     about 800 million from 2009 through 2013 however without additional tools to close
     the large ongoing budget gap service levels must be reduced to balance the budget

     currently metro transit is planning to cut up to 550000 hours in annual service with
     service reductions beginning in fall 2014 and continuing into 2015 overall metro transit
     expects to reduce service by 16 percent this reduction is due to an annual budget shortfall
     of 75 million attributable to falling sales tax revenues  metro transits largest source of
     funding sales tax revenues have grown in recent years but is still below inflation adjusted
     2008 revenues



     looking forward
     updating and expanding transportation equipment
     in addition to tackling the funding challenge the county faces the pressing need to expand
     types and quantities of transportation equipment there is not a one size fits all solution
     to the variety of business needs and vehicle and equipment solutions for the countys
     fleets while electric vehicles may work in certain circumstances the vast expanse of the
     county service area prohibits widespread use because of current technology limitations the
     county will continue to search for the best solutions to effectively meet its specific business
     needs

     for metro transit the vision for a future fleet is one driven by clean electric energy as a
     transition toward this vision metro transit will utilize electric trolleys and dieselelectric
     hybrid buses this will support the transition toward a truly all electric transit bus as the
     battery propulsion technology matures metro transit has numerous projects under way
     to help enhance the efficiency of fleet vehicles reduce emissions and test innovative
     technologies as highlighted below
        trolley fleet replacement  metro transit was awarded a contract in summer 2013
         for the purchase of a new fleet of electric trolley buses the replacement trolley buses
         will have offwire capability provided by an onboard electric energy system and will
         be more efficient than current dcpowered vehicles the result will be a zero emission
         trolley bus system that can operate without interruptions due to construction projects
         reducing fuel consumption and ghg emissions relative to the existing trolley fleet
         which frequently cannot be used on weekends when construction often occurs

   diesel bus replacement  metro transit is continuing to acquire dieselelectric hybrid
    buses to replace the aging diesel fleet a total of 43 60foot low floor hybrid coaches
    were delivered in 2013 to serve the new rapidride lines e and f these hybrid buses
    are up to 30 percent more fuel efficient than the diesels they replace metro transit
    has a contract to purchase an additional 120 hybrid coaches both 35 and 40foot
    coaches to replace existing diesel coaches beginning in 2014
   battery bus pilot project  metro transit is at the forefront of public transportation
    technology with its all electric zeroemissions heavy duty transit bus pilot program
    initial bids received for the 5 million federally funded battery powered bus project
    in 2012 were rejected due to technological limitations on travel range and charging
    and the project was rebid in 2013 a contract should be awarded in mid2014 with
    expected delivery in 20142015 if successful batterypowered buses may become the
    transit fleet of the future
   electric vehicle subcomponents  metro transit is initiating the use of electric
    subcomponents on transit vehicles by replacing components that are traditionally
    driven off belts and gears from the engine such as cooling fans electric engine fan
    cooling systems are expected to improve fuel efficiency on coaches by up to 5 percent
    additional benefits associated with these upgrades include better reliability lower
    emissions easier maintenance and improved bus performance
   ecodrivingconnect  metro transit will test onboard telematics and operational
    monitoring systems to promote gentler acceleration braking turning and reduced idling
    in a limited number of hybrid coaches in 2014 such techniques have been shown to
    reduce fuel use by approximately 6 percent

as metro transit moves ahead to upgrade the fleet it will use the adopted strategic plan
for public transportation to guide potential investments in new services demand for metro
transits services is growing even as service reductions are planned metro transit will strive
to configure its services to attract the maximum gains in ridership to ultimately reduce ghg
emissions in king county

reduce the impacts of its buildings and facilities through such actions as more efficient
operation of existing buildings efficient design and construction of new facilities meeting
energy needs with renewable resources resulting from county operations and taking
advantage of costeffective opportunities to generate renewable energy energy continues to
be a major cost to the county and reducing this expense will contribute to king countys
ability to maintain critical services

king county has set aggressive energy efficiency and sustainable development goals in
the 2010 energy plan ordinance 13368 the 2012 scap and 2013 green building

2013 key accomplishments
2013 government confluence
the highlight of this years program was the semiannual greentools government
confluence cosponsored by the cascadia green building council topics ranged from
rooftop gardening to resiliency impacts and sustainable transit the confluence was
produced in conjunction with the living future conference giving attendees access to
presenters from outside the region and north america the confluence also provided
continuing education credits for architects engineers and green building experts via the
american institute of architects american planning association the us green building
council usgbc and the living future institute the may 15 confluence was combined
with the living future unconference bringing collaboration through partnership with the
cascadia green building council regional state national and international leaders came
together with government employees and elected officials with the goal of kickstarting or
enhancing their green building initiatives the 2013 gathering proved to be the largest
confluence to date with some 300 people representing 31 cities five counties five states
the district of columbia as well as international participants from canada germany
mexico and the netherlands executive constantine was the keynote speaker for this event


providing green building assistance to diverse audiences
the king county greentools program developed its first vietnameselanguage materials
with a green remodel guide the piece was specifically developed to address the needs
of the vietnamese community with custom graphics and information tailored to serve a
growing audience outreach efforts included a sustainable cities roundtable featuring vu
lee director of the vietnamese friendship association and distributing 4000 guides in
28 locations throughout king county

greentools also provided technical assistance to new senior housing projects in normandy
park and redmond the greenworks project in normandy park is comprised of 10
townhomes built in the early 1970s the project is anticipating a solar array for the
community center rain gardens for the site and two whole house remodels redmond
senior housing owned by the city of redmond consists of 75 units of affordable senior
housing plus a commercial tenant space

king county greentools produced a detailed workshop with national green building leader
and universal design expert sim van der ryn a senior himself at the age of 85 who
brought his unique perspective to a small group of interested industry government and
community leaders


regional code collaboration
the regional code collaboration is a multijurisdictional group of planners and code
officials from both within and outside king county that have come together to develop
and update green codes to advance sustainability and green building practices it consists
of over 40 members representing 12 cities and three counties in 2013 the greentools
program convened the regional code collaboration with the city of seattle to continue the

king countys 2013 climate change energy green building and environmental purchasing programs   19

                               momentum started in 2012 the cities of issaquah seattle and shoreline were the first to
                               successfully pass their code packages king county legislated the development of a cutting
                               edge demonstration ordinance for the living building challenge which was unveiled in
                               2013 and included in the newly passed green building ordinance


                               west point cogeneration
                               by yearend 2013 the cogeneration system at the west point wastewater treatment plant
                               was in full operation the 23megawatt system is anticipated to generate more than 17
                               million kilowatt hours of electricity each year in addition to providing valuable heat for the
                               treatment plant moving to full operation of the cogeneration plant was a multiyear effort
                               dating back to the decommissioning of the former outdated cogeneration plant in 2007
                               the electricity from the west point cogeneration plant is sold to seattle city light and is
                               marketed as green energy the heat from the cogeneration system is used to heat the plant
                               and digesters offsetting energy used to generate heat from propane or direct biogas use

2013 status
king county achieved an 85 percent normalized energy use reduction between 2007
and 2013 raw energy use was down over 13 percent in tracked facilities which was
normalized to the lower figure due to milder weather departments and divisions across
county government continue to pursue energy efficiency investments that demonstrate
notable energy reductions specifically the metro transit and wastewater treatment divisions
have been investing millions of dollars in efficient mechanical and lighting systems that are
producing energy and costs savings investments are continuing in 2014 and are focused on
achieving a clear path toward meeting the 15 percent energy use reduction target by 2015
and the 20 percent reduction goal by 2020

2013 key accomplishments


new 2013 green building ordinance adopted
the metropolitan king county council approved an update to the green building ordinance
that includes improvements to meet longterm county goals the ordinance establishes
minimum performance requirements for energy emissions stormwater management and
construction and demolition materials diversion while raising the certification goal for
capital projects to platinum using the leed and sustainable infrastructure scorecard rating
systems it also supports flexibility by allowing alternative green building rating systems such
as built green and living building challenge

in support of equity and social justice efforts department of community and human
services dchs staff worked with affordable housing stakeholders to include county funded
affordable housing projects in the new ordinance this will recognize the green building
achievements the stakeholders and staff have accomplished using the evergreen sustainable
development standard an existing green building practice for equitable access to improved
public health air quality and walkable communities for homeless and lowincome residents


green community initiative
king county worked with the washington state housing finance commission wshfc
to establish a green community initiative that facilitates access to qualified energy
conservation bonds qecbs for community businesses governments and nonprofit
organizations the qecbs are a federal buydown of interest rates for project bond
financing thereby offering extremely attractive interest rates for energy and other
environmentallybeneficial projects the green community initiative framework established
between king county and wshfc also served as a template for kitsap countys green
community initiative


green building compliance
green building activity by king county agencies in 2013 consisted of seven leed projects
and 280 projects using the king county sustainable infrastructure scorecard this
represents 98 percent of all capital projects which is an improvement over the 925 percent
compliance in 2012

                  energy efficiency facility renovations
                  many king county facilities tackled energy saving retrofits in 2013 examples include
                  south treatment plant lighting
                  the south treatment plant began a comprehensive lighting retrofit project that is replacing
                  over 4000 of the plants lamps with led and induction lighting technologies the resulting
                  lamps will save on energy while reducing maintenance costs the twophase project will
                  be completed in 2014 and is on track to reduce electricity use by over 800000 kwh
                  and 60000 per year while bringing in over 260000 of rebate money from puget

                  energy awareness campaign
                  for the second year in a row king county conducted a fall energy awareness effort to
                  educate employees on actions they can take to contribute to reduction efforts three
                  trainings were offered to county employees focused on energy conservation these trainings
                  provide resources and examples to support employees to meet the countys energy targets
                  attendees learned about energy auditing and assessments low cost energy and water
                  saving actions cost effective energy investments and king countys green operations
                  and maintenance guidelines handbook in addition three monthly newsletters were
                  published and hundreds of employees attended energy awareness events more than 1300
                  employees took a pledge to reduce their energy use the fall energy awareness effort will
                  be an annual event to engage employees in conservation activities at the beginning of each
                  heating season

metro transit replaced seven bus
garage ventilation fans and related
equipment at the north base
transit facility in 2013 this project
is projected to save approximately
2 million kwh per year equivalent to
over 116000 in annual savings in
addition metro transit received over
450000 in incentive payments
from seattle city light for this
project project elements that
support energy efficiency goals
included air quality monitoring
systems to bring in the proper
amount of fresh air highefficiency
lighting in the fan rooms and
variable speed fan motor starters
an integral project element was
installation of controls to ensure fans
come on when certain atmospheric
conditions require them ie when
nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide        installing new ventilation fans at the metro transit
                                         north base garage
gas levels require ventilation this is
a major contributing factor to the reduced electricity requirement as the fans run when
needed rather than on a timer which results in to less run time and less energy use



partnership with built green
in an effort to increase the number of projects using greenbuilding rating systems king
county greentools has partnered with the master builders associations built green
program for many years it is estimated that by the end of 2017 residential construction
units will exceed prerecession levels and 35 percent of all new construction could
be built green leed evergreen or living building certified built green is one of the
only regional rating systems in the country to have certifications for retrofits whole
house remodels and new construction partnership efforts in 2013 included an annual
conference held at the brightwater education center providing education to developers
and builders opening the zhome stewardship center and further development of a carbon
neutral standard called emerald star

                   energy conservation goal
                   the county is continuing to make investments and take actions toward meeting its
                   15 percent energy reduction goal by 2015 the goal is attainable and raw energy use in
                   2013 is down over 13 percent since 2007 at facilities being tracked county divisions
                   are assessing and planning the actions that will be needed to achieve the 15 percent and
                   20 percent reduction goals

                   county employees began meeting in 2013 to address access to funding for energy
                   efficiency projects as part of the 20152016 budget cycle a framework has been
                   established for departments and divisions to propose projects and access 10year loans
                   that will be paid back from utility savings this approach is intended to help overcome the
                   financial barrier for project implementation by helping to fund projects that can pay for
                   themselves in 10 years or less also by the end of 2013 by leveraging a utility grant a
                   comprehensive and customized building operator certification training series was put in
                   place this eightday training program to take place in 2014 will educate more than 40

forests and agriculture

background
king countys forests and farms provide significant environmental social and economic
benefits forests and farms offer important recreational opportunities improve air quality
and provide food water and cover for endangered salmon wildlife and people these same
forests and farms provide employment in wood paper recreation tourism fishing and
agricultural industries healthy forests and sustainable farms can also help reduce local
climate change impacts while reducing local sources of ghg emissions

this goal area directly ties to the kcsp objective reduce climate pollution as well as the
objective to encourage sustainable agriculture and forestry it also directly relates to king
countys open space plan 2010 which provides the policy framework for the countys
acquisition development stewardship management and funding of king countys open
space system

king county has taken significant action to encourage sustainable land management
practices and to help permanently protect privatelyowned forest and agricultural lands
through tax incentives conservation easements preservation programs and public
education and outreach the county is also demonstrating leadership through careful
stewardship of county owned lands

th county increased conservation acreage through the open space and forestland current
use taxation programs agricultural land preservation conservation easements and forest
planning and stewardship throughout 2013

     is enrolled in current use taxation incentive programs

     2013 status
     in 2013 660 new acres were enrolled in open space and forest land designated current
     use taxation incentive programs or completed stewardship plans exceeding the annual
     target at the end of 2013 there were approximately 65600 rural acres enrolled in these
     programs which provide significant property tax incentives to encourage landowners to
     voluntarily conserve protect and manage open space and forestland

     2013 status
     in 2013 king county conserved an additional 550 acres of forested land in rural zones
     of king county near the boundaries of the forest production district the 550 acres of
     newly conserved forestland resulted from a total of five transactions four fee purchases
     totaling 450 acres and one transfer of development rights tdr easement purchase on an
     additional 100 acres

     there are now more than 142100 acres of forestland protected through king countys
     tdr program since 2004 public tdr transactions have protected more than 96000
     acres and private transactions have protected nearly 46000 acres fee purchases of an
     additional 15500 acres of forestlands bring the total to nearly 158000 acres of forest
     lands permanently conserved


     performance measure 3
     king county agricultural lands permanently conserved through easements that remove the
     development rights

     target 3
     in 2014 the water and land resources division wlrd will continue to collaborate
     with the king county agriculture commission to develop targets for the number of
     acres preserved in the farmland preservation program under the countys new food
     economy initiative wlrd will also partner with the commission and develop appropriate
     partnerships to increase agricultural production

2013 status
the farmland preservation program began in 1979 when the voters of king county
approved an initiative authorizing the county to preserve rapidly diminishing farmland
by purchasing conservation easements during the 1980s king county acquired the
development rights on 12600 acres of high quality farmland within its boundaries the
county has continued to purchase development rights on select properties and by the
end of 2013 approximately 13500 acres had been permanently protected through this
program wlrd also supports farming in king county by assisting with drainage flood
risk reduction marketing cost share for resource improvement practices and other issues
affecting farm productivity the division will continue to evaluate how best to encourage
increased agricultural production




in december 2013 king county acquired nearly 200 acres of rich snoqualmie valley farmland  an
abandoned golf course known as the tall chief property this fertile land that was recently threatened
with development will be returned to farming helping sequester carbon in soil creating more jobs for rural
residents supporting a more robust local food supply and ensuring an even stronger wall against sprawl


2013 key accomplishments
forest stewardship courses and workshops
over 100 forest landowners expanded their forest management skills in countysponsored
trainings and seminars in 2013 opportunities ranged from forest stewardship planning
classes to demonstrations of silvicultural techniques wildlife habitat enhancement timber
harvest planning and forestry economic development forums a summer 2013 forestry
economic development twilight tour on vashon island highlighted the use of locallygrown
and locally milled wood on the island additionally in 2013 the county partnered with the
cascade harvest coalition to create a puget sound grown website complete with mobile
app and gis map connections to promote local forest products and connect wood users
and forest landowners

2013 key accomplishments
forest assessment
in 2013 king county parks in partnership with the united states forest service and
forterra completed a fouryear forest assessment known as flat  forest landscape
assessment tool  on over 24000 acres of king county managed forestlands parks
employees collected field data that describe current forest conditions at over 180 king
county parks sites this project establishes a permanent database of forest conditions
the baseline data is used to develop more detailed forest stewardship plans such as at
danvillegeorgetown open space see below accomplishment and provides guidance
that will help direct the stewardship and management of parks forests and allow for more
efficient and productive use of restoration and stewardship resources the project was
funded by the forest service through the american recovery and reinvestment act

the danvillegeorgetown forest stewardship
plan was adopted in 2013 for this 334
acre open space site east of maple valley
that is dominated by 35year old douglasfir
plantations in the summer of 2013 120 acres
were thinned to accelerate development of late

                  loop biosolids
                  one way that king county supports healthy productive farms and forests that help
                  maximize biological carbon storage is with loop biosolids an organic product extracted
                  during the wastewater treatment process as a soil amendment and replacement for
                  synthetic fertilizer loop returns nutrients and carbonrich organic matter to the soil
                  both improving soil health and growing plants faster king county estimates that in 2013
                  approximately 39000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of ghg emissions were
                  reduced through the land application of loop biosolids as a result of the loop program
                  in conjunction with its energy efficiency and renewable energy efforts king countys
                  wastewater treatment division is now almost 70 percent ghg neutral in its operations


                  forest restoration volunteer program

application toward sequestering more carbon in soil and vegetation



challenges  opportunities
preparing land managers for climate change
over time forest landowners will be challenged to adapt land management strategies to
changes in climate as the effects of climate change become better understood it will be
important to educate owners of small lot forestlands to adapt land management priorities
and actions to changing conditions


forest stewardship with tribes
in 2013 a new program provided forest stewardship training for tribal members wlrd
employees will continue to seek partnerships with local tribes to expand opportunities for
integrating traditional land management practices into forestry education and outreach

     looking forward
     developing new partnerships
     for the past 10 years king county parks has successfully developed corporate and
     community partnerships that help improve parks trails and recreation amenities from
     volunteer habitat restoration work parties to protecting new open space lands the division
     continues to develop diverse types of partnerships on the horizon are exciting new
     partnership opportunities that will allow for more forest restoration  for example in 2014
     king county parks will partner with forterras carbon capturing companies program and
     the university of washingtons school of environmental and forest sciences  collaborative
     efforts that will help accelerate progress toward king countys forest restoration and ghg
     emissions reduction commitments


     updating performance measures and targets
     in updating king countys 2015 scap employees from the wlr and parks divisions will
     improve the usability and value of the forests and agriculture goal area performance
     measures for example king county will work to adopt next step targets for forest

consumption and
materials management

background
the purchase use and disposal of goods and services by king county residents
businesses and governments are associated with significant ghg emissions these
emissions can occur at all stages of a products life cycle from resource extraction
farming manufacturing processing transportation sale use and disposal

according to a 2012 county emissions inventory purchasing goods and services accounts
for 270000 metric tons or about 42 percent of the countys operationsrelated ghg
emissions of 643000 metric tons these emissions can be reduced by purchasing
environmentally preferable products recycled content low toxic resource efficient
and more durable products all have a lesser or reduced impact on the environment the
purchase and reuse of these products avoids resource extraction and consumption and
ultimately disposal of new materials which decreases ghg emissions

king county provides an extensive number of services that support county residents and
businesses in choosing sustainable products reducing the amount they purchase reusing
goods when possible and recycling following their use the county operates a system of
transfer stations that offer a variety of recycling options partners with cities who contract
for residential and commercial collection in many areas of the county sponsors programs
that increase recycled content in goods consumed within the county and conducts
outreach campaigns to promote best practices

internally the environmentally preferable purchasing program provides county personnel
with information and technical assistance to help them identify evaluate and purchase
economical and effective environmentally preferable products and services while the
greentools program works with king county projects on deconstruction salvage and reuse
construction debris recycling and specification of green building materials

    management plan goal of 58 pounds per week
   residentialnonresidential disposal goals  in 2012 residents disposed of 134
    pounds of waste per week which is a modest reduction compared to the previous
    reporting period and surpasses the comprehensive solid waste management plan goal
    of 142 pounds per week by 2020 in king county businesses the amount of waste
    disposed per week per employee in 2012 was 186 pounds which is also a reduction
    compared to the previous reporting period and surpasses the comprehensive solid
    waste management plan goal of 229 pounds per week the downward trends here and
    the above nonresidential waste prevention per employee figure is most likely attributed
    to strong and continued effort in the business sector to extensive cost cutting efforts
    given the state of the economy
   note  a reduction in these goals in this case is a positive result  less waste generated



2013 key accomplishments
recycle more its easy to do
recycle more its easy to do is a regional education campaign focused on increasing
residential recycling rates particularly in areas of the county with lower recycling rates

it is estimated that in 2013 more than 866000 tons of recyclables were collected in
king county from residents and businesses including 9500 tons from transfer stations
according to environmental protection agency epa modeling this represents ghg
emission reductions equivalent to 13 million metric ton equivalents of carbon dioxide
this is the equivalent of removing annual emissions from 207415 passenger vehicles or
conserving 118589445 gallons of gasoline per epas waste reduction model



food too good to waste
the ghg emissions of food production and consumption are significant on par with
emissions associated with building energy usage and yet americans waste a quarter of all
the food they purchase the average singlefamily household in king county throws away
390 pounds of food each year in fall 2013 king county launched food too good to
waste a countywide education campaign aimed at reducing the amount of residential
food waste the campaign was designed through a collaboration between the epa king
county and more than 25 other government partners king county piloted the campaign
in 2012 with a local elementary school more recent approaches included online videos
that combined cooking and grocery shopping tips with food waste prevention strategies in
partnership with a local grocery store an advertising and media campaign to drive video
views and expanded web resources

project profile
                   the new bow lake recycling and transfer station was completed in 2013 with an
                   expanded recycling area this single station receives about one third of the countys total
                   garbage tonnage for transfer to the landfill and is now on track to double the amount of
                   recycling that takes place in the transfer station system

                   the design of the new station incorporates many new features including

                      two preload compactors to improve operational efficiency and decrease the number
                       of transfer trailer truck trips required to and from the station

                      sustainable building design features such as solar panels and energyefficient lighting
                       that will result in lower lifecycle costs than conventional building design

                      multiple gutters channel rainwater from the roof into two underground 15000gallon
                       vaults the rainwater is used in washing down station floors and equipment

                                                           them to take small quantities of
                                                           binders on an ongoing basis for
                                                           manual disassembly and recycling of

    more than 200 boxes of binders were delivered
                                                           take all of our binders at no cost
    to the stuff the bus campaign




challenges  opportunities
collaborative efforts to achieve zero waste
achieving a 70 percent recycling rate and zero waste of resources will take a collaborative
effort on the part of the county the cities and the private solid waste and recycling
companies it is likely that a combination of efforts will be required to encourage the
desired behaviors
   making sure that adequate public andor private infrastructure is in place eg building
    new transfer stations materials recycling facilities capacitycapabilities
   continued education and promotion
   incentives such as grants and recycling fees at transfer stations and
   mandates or bans on disposal of certain materials such as those with a high value or are
    easily recyclable



100 percent paper compliance
achieving 100 percent compliance of the purchase of 100 percent recycled content copy
paper remains a challenge the cost of 100 percent recycled content is approximately 15
to 20 percent more than 30 percent recycled content paper which limits agencies full
participation in this effort when factoring in 20 percent copy paper reductions achieved
the county is able to offset the additional cost of the higher recycled percentage of paper
which results in an overall cost savings




king countys 2013 climate change energy green building and environmental purchasing programs   43

     the environmental defense fund paper calculator estimates that if the county converted
     the remaining purchases to 100 percent recycled content copy paper instead of 30 percent
     content the resulting environmental impact would conserve the equivalent of 4560 trees
     213 million gallons of water and approximately 197 tons of co2 annually


     new green building ordinance
     the 2013 green building ordinance includes minimum performance requirements for
     diverting construction and demolition material from landfills for county owned capital
     projects performance will be phased in with an 80 percent diversion rate by 2016 and an
     85 percent diversion rate by 2025 in order to meet the king county comprehensive plans
     goals of achieving zero waste of resources by 2030 in addition the new green building
     policy will include reporting criteria to track use of environmentally preferred products and
     cd diversion performance better data collection will help identify where improvements
     can be made


     looking forward
     there are many efforts planned for 2014 and beyond to increase waste diversion to reduce
     ghg emissions associated with consumption and to ensure compliance with internal
     policies including


     material resource recovery at transfer stations
     the solid waste division will test recovery methods and evaluate feasibility of targeting
     additional materials for diversion that have previously been disposed initial materials
     include high value resources including wood metal and cardboard lessons learned
     will be used to standardize operational practices across the system where applicable to
     significantly increase diversion


     recycled paper compliance
     additional strategies will be implemented to increase the purchase of 100 percent recycled
     content paper by county agencies including quarterly compliance reporting by departments
     to the executives office and incentivesdirectives for compliance metro transit added the
     purchase of 100 percent recycled content copy paper as a specific target in its first ever
     sustainability plan released in april 2014 and its sustainability program coordinator
     is working with individual sections to provide education and outreach on both decreasing
     paper use and increasing purchases of 100 percent recycled content paper

preparing for climate change impacts

background
across the globe climate change is having serious impacts sea levels are rising heat
waves and droughts are occurring more frequently and for longer periods glaciers are
melting and climaterelated natural disasters are causing significant environmental public
health and economic impacts

in the pacific northwest scientists have documented warming temperatures increasing
ocean acidity declining glacial area and spring snowpack and changing streamflows
these longterm changes are consistent with those observed globally as a result of human
caused climate change in the coming decades shortterm natural climate variability
will continue to affect our weather and climate but cannot distract us from planning for
important longterm trends

according to the american association for advancement of sciences recent summary
report we are at risk of pushing our climate system toward abrupt unpredictable and
potentially irreversible changes with highly damaging impacts earths climate is on a path
to warm beyond the range of what has been experienced over the past millions of years
king county faces significant environmental and economic challenges stemming from
climate change including stressed and changing ecosystems costly impacts on public and
private property and new public health risks

county efforts to prepare for climate change directly tie to the kcsp objective prepare
for the effects of climate change on the environment human health and the economy
this work also relates to diverse county policies focused on preparing for climate change
impacts as summarized in king countys comprehensive plan including policies to
partner with others to address the impacts of climate change and to reduce the impacts of
climate change on public and private infrastructure the natural environment and public
health

the county has developed programs and projects to help reduce the impacts of floods
support farm and forest owner action to address climate change impacts and begin to
prepare the region for the effects of climate change on stormwater public health and
emergency response these efforts promote equity and social justice by helping those who
are most vulnerable to climate change impacts king county is also working to plan and
prepare for the likely impacts of climate change on countyowned facilities infrastructure
and natural resources

     much of king countys focus in 2013 was on strategies to reduce ghg emissions king
     county continues to take incremental steps to incorporate climate change information into
     relevant projects and programs however significant work remains to follow through on the

     performance measure 1
     number of king county homes at risk of flooding or river channel migration

     target 1
     targets are being developed as part of river corridor plans scheduled to be completed on
     individual river segments between 2014 and 2016

     2013 status
     there were 3820 homes in king county that were within mapped 100 year river
     floodplains channel migration zones or historic river channel meander belts in 2012
     which was the first year that this performance measure was tracked of the 3820 homes
     171 were classified by the federal emergency management agency as repetitive loss
     structures based on the frequency and magnitude of flood insurance claims efforts such
     as the purchase or elevation of repetitively damaged homes will help decrease the number
     of structures at risk however there is the potential for the number of homes at risk to
     increase in some king county cities where regulations may allow for development in flood
     and channel migration hazard areas over the long term climate change could also affect
     the number of homes in flood areas



     2013 key accomplishments
     manage flood risks
     as service provider to the king county flood control district between 2007 and 2013
     king county completed the following actions to reduce the risk of flooding and channel
     migration
        acquired 160 parcels totaling 356 acres
        demolished 160 atrisk structures and relocated 17 structures outside the
         flood hazard area
        elevated 54 homes three agricultural structures and supported the construction of
         26 farm pads to increase community resiliency to flooding and
        completed 76 construction projects ranging from small repair to major levee setbacks

in 2013 king county completed the largest inriver
flood protection project since the 2007 creation of
the king county flood control district the new
milelong levee along the western bank of the green
river was completed on time and within budget the
levee protects thousands of auburn residents more
than 300 residential properties and 275 commercial
properties with a combined value of 680 million
plus several major transportation corridors the 17
million project involved excavating enough soil to
fill 80000 fullsized pickup trucks installing nearly
4300 feet of drainage pipe placing 340 logs and
48000 tons of rock and planting more than 18000
native trees and shrubs to stabilize soil and provide

                  2013 key accomplishments
                  sealevel rise impacts to wastewater treatment infrastructure
                  in 2013 wtds climate change program assessed its conveyance system and performed a
                  hydraulic analysis of sealevel rise impacts on essential facilities in the conveyance system
                  this assessment included measuring and quantifying the current impact of saltwater
                  intrusion into the conveyance system the evaluations looked at both the potential for
                  structural flooding of the facility and the increased level of saltwater intrusion into the
                  conveyance system through outfalls the analysis indicated that 20 facilities are at risk of
                  saltwater inflow because their weir elevations are lower than the highest predicted tides

                                                             wtd has also completed an assessment of on
                                                             site flooding from sealevel rise to the west point

                                                             assessment concluded that west point is adequately
                                                             protected against flooding from sealevel rise both
                                                             now and in the foreseeable future because of the
                                                             past construction of large landscaped walls and

coastal wetland restoration
the water and land resources division considers climate change impacts in habitat
assessments environmental review of land use and in species and habitat recovery efforts
for example as part of the cove creek shoreline restoration project on vashon island
saltwater wetlands are being constructed to include topographic variability to ensure proper
function at multiple tidal elevations which also provides resiliency as sea level rises




before                                                           after
the dockton heights shoreline restoration project on vashon island mostly completed during 2013 removed
creosote pilings shoreline armoring and fill from a marine shoreline the project was designed to have the
necessary resiliency to withstand sealevel rise



challenges  opportunities
the challenge of unprecedented changes
the rate and magnitude of climate change impacts facing the puget sound region
is daunting changes already observed such as increasing temperatures decreasing
snowpack and acidifying waters in the puget sound are cause for alarm there is
reason to be optimistic that global sources of ghg emissions will be curtailed and the
most serious impacts will be averted if they are not the region will need to respond to
increasingly drastic changes and impacts to its environment economy and public health


creating resilience
many actions that help reduce ghg emissions  such as king countys efforts to provide
transportation choices support development of local renewable energy and encourage
healthy forests  also foster communities that are more resilient in the face of climate
changerelated risks and impacts for example in the case of severe weather healthy
forests can help reduce the impacts of stormwater runoff and flooding while transportation
and energy alternatives can allow for decreased community impacts and faster recovery
king county is working to help implement preparedness strategies that have the dual
climate change benefits of reducing ghg emissions and also supporting resilient healthy
communities

     looking forward
     wastewater treatment division and river flooding
     in 2014 wtd is assessing the potential impacts from possible increased river flooding on
     key facilities and transportation infrastructure that support the operation of wtds facilities
     and conveyance system

     the division is developing strategies for reducing the risks and mitigating future impacts
     from sea level rise and river flooding the division also performs a vulnerability assessment
     of wastewater facilities and conveyance systems during project planning so design teams
     can consider reducing the risk associated with future sealevel rise


     assessing new impacts stormwater and puget sound ocean acidification
     scientists governments businesses and the public are recognizing that the era of human
     caused climate change has arrived and are taking new steps to reduce these impacts king
     county is exploring new collaborative partnerships with for example king countys cities
     the federal government and nonprofit foundations and organizations for example in
     2013 king county partnered with epa scientists to begin assessing climate change impacts
     on future rainfall patterns and future stormwater management needs in addition as part of
     the 2014 budget the king county council directed the water and land resources division
     to begin monitoring ocean acidification in puget sound in cooperation with several federal
     agencies and the washington state department of ecology


     mainstreaming climate change preparedness
     the county and its partners are working to incorporate climate change considerations early
     into program and project designs the goal is that these efforts are less retrofits and
     more everyday business although climate change preparedness is an emerging field an
     early focus on prevention can be the most effective and efficient solution this is why king
     county is committed to planning and preparing for the likely impacts of climate change on
     countyowned facilities infrastructure and natural resources


     measuring success
     as king county works to implement climate change preparedness actions it will be critical
     to measure their effectiveness however measuring effectiveness of preventionfocused
     actions is challenging especially in light of the uncertainty of climate change impacts the
     performance measures related to this goal area of the scap in conjunction with the new
     environmental health and economic impacts of climate change indicators are the early
     stages of effective climate change preparedness performance management several related
     efforts  king countys participation as a pilot sustainability tools for assessing and rating
     communities star community the king county flood hazard management plan update
     and the 2015 scap update  mean that there will be significant nearterm progress toward
     measuring the impacts of these efforts

appendix

king county ordinance 17270 requires this report include information about all expenses
associated with the climate change program and a costbenefit analysis of the program



approach and cost of climate change program
the king county comprehensive plan includes policies directing king county to reduce
greenhouse gas ghg emissions prepare for climate change impacts assess this work
and collaborate with others on solutions king countys strategic plan includes the
objective to reduce climate pollution and prepare for the impacts of climate change on the
environment human health and economy

in 2012 king county adopted its strategic climate action plan scap was submitted to
the county council by executive dow constantine in response to ordinance 17270 the
plan synthesizes and focuses king countys most critical goals objectives and strategies
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the effects of climate change the
comprehensive plan strategic plan and scap guide king countys efforts as they relate to
climate change

the countys climate change efforts are led out of the department of natural resources
and parks dnrp the 2013 expenditure for the one employee position focused on
climate change was approximately 115000

the actions needed to carry out climaterelated comprehensive plan strategic plan and
scap goals and objectives intersect with the roles and work of multiple departments and
divisions in king county in order to integrate actions and pool technical resources across
county agencies the climate program employee works closely with several climatefocused
teams supporting development and implementation of county directives related to climate
change these interdisciplinary teams bring together additional county employees focused
on complementary tasks such as those implementing the energy plan the green building
and sustainable development program the environmental purchasing program and those
in forestry and agriculture programs

the county also pools resources for climaterelated technical assessments eg ghg
emissions inventories public outreach and program development with cities through
the sustainable cities roundtable king countycities climate collaboration and through
professional associations such as climate communities and icleilocal governments for




king countys 2013 climate change energy green building and environmental purchasing programs   53

     sustainability membership in these types of organizations gives king county employees
     ready access to information on local government approaches to reducing climate pollution
     and preparing for climate changes federal and state grant programs and changing
     regulatory requirements dues for these organizations were approximately 25000 in

     benefits of climate change program
     supporting implementation of a climate changerelated projects and programs such as
     those highlighted in this report have direct climaterelated benefits as well as other
     benefits such as reducing water pollution creating new local green jobs and enhancing
     residents quality of life specific financial benefits include
        helping secure revenue to support related county projects and programs
         for example in 2013 king county received a 500000 washington state energy
         efficiency grant to partially fund a mechanical system energy efficiency project at the
         weyerhaeuser king county aquatic center and a lighting retrofit project at the west
         point treatment plant
        increasing efficiency of county operations significant cost savings and new revenue
         sources have been achieved through climate related projects that reduce ghg
         emissions by minimizing energy waste and resource expenditures and by creating new
         resources such as renewable energy for example king county has reduced energy use
         in governmentowned facilities by nearly 10 percent since 2007 and in doing so has
         reduced operational resource costs by approximately 26 million annually through
         related projects
        mitigating future climate change impacts a key benefit relates to minimizing and
         avoiding climate change risks by integrating climate change science into the planning
         and design of diverse projects and programs for example the wastewater treatment
         division has been integrating data about sea level rise into wastewater infrastructure
         design and operations the financial value of making these decisions is likely
         significant for example the washington state department of ecologys impacts of
         climate change on washingtons economy concluded that if ghg emissions are not
         reduced and proactive steps to minimize impacts are not taken the annual washington
         state price tag of climate change impacts will be at least 38 billion by 2020

     there are other lessquantifiable benefits related to climate solutions county council and
     executive leadership on the issue improving relations with king county cities through
     regional collaboration improving the quality of life and health of our residents helping
     residents and businesses save money on energy and resource costs supporting community
     and business environmental and climate efforts and achieving other environmental
     sustainability related objectives
