seppäläs carrier bags
are made of
100 recycled material

s
             eppälä switched over to recycled plastic carrier bags in autumn 2009
                  customer feedback received by the group indicated that environmentally friendly
             carrier bags and responsible alternatives to conventional carrier bags are important
             issues for our customers when redesigning the look of our carrier bags we also wanted
them to be made from more responsible materials we are extremely pleased that our supplier was
able to offer us a carrier bag option made completely from recycled material explains annu pätiälä
seppäläs marketing manager
     i believe that this is a meaningful step to take as seppälä stores serve millions of buying cus
tomers every year in six different countries for most of them we pack their purchases in a seppälä
carrier bag by switching over to carrier bags made of 100 per cent recycled plastic we are saving
nonrenewable resources and reducing the environmental impact of our activities pätiälä adds
the environmental impact of carrier bags made of recycled plastic is lower still if they are reused a
number of times and then finally used to bag household waste




 seppälä carrier bags are now labelled 100 recycled material

                                                                                                             stockmann groups sustainability report 2009  14




lindexs new environmental code for cleaner water
lindex works closely with about 250 suppliers at over 400 factories mainly in asia but also in europe it
chooses its suppliers carefully and monitors their operations by conducting regular checks in factories
and arranging training events on matters such as improving working conditions for employees and
taking environmental matters into account
     in lindexs code of conduct drawn up for its suppliers environmental requirements are laid down
principally for the factories engaged in garment stitching the textile industrys biggest environmental
impact is nevertheless from wet processes like dyeing printing and washing this is why in 2009 lin
dex introduced a new environmental code that classifies suppliers working with wet processes as either
green yellow or red suppliers in accordance with how well they meet lindexs environmental require
ments suppliers must sign an agreement that sets requirements for them concerning such matters
as water treatment water sample analysis and treatment of chemicals as well as limits on emissions
where necessary the agreement also includes measures that must be taken before the supplier can
attain a better classification on lindexs scale some subcontractors for the largest suppliers have
voluntarily called for an environmental audit of their factories
     suppliers have been very willing to cooperate and have acted openly and been interested in imp
roving their working practices we have also found that the environmental knowledge of suppliers has
improved over the course of the project says ingela lind the project manager for the environmental
code at lindex the most commonly found shortcomings have been the lack of written guidelines and
the treatment of hazardous waste in bangladesh and china the storage and handling of chemicals
and the inadequate use of protective equipment are still a problem
     fulfilment of the requirements is monitored by lindexs own local inspectors who train suppliers
and distribute environmental information during 2010 a joint training project is being started with supp
liers the aim of which is to rectify the most common deficiencies
     in bangladesh for instance environmental and water pollution caused by the textile industry is a
major problem there is room for improvement in the treatment of untreated water waste and sludge
and at many factories knowledge of environmental matters is limited and environmental matters are not
taken into account sufficiently one lindex supplier in bangladesh that dyes and prints fabrics has mo
ved up from the red to the yellow classification this supplier was involved in an environmental project
that lindex undertook with local organisations during the year the supplier built a new water treatment
plant and also focused more attention on environmental work in other aspects of the operation its aim
is to continue the work in order to achieve the green level classification
     lindexs longestablished work in bangladesh was rewarded in 2009 when it received an award
from the bangladesh garment manufacturers and exporters association bgmea for its work towards
improvements in the countrys economic development environment and social responsibility
