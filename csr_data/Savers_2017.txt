introduction




           this lack of understanding can be compared to the         water is only one of the natural resources used in
           misconceptions and lack of awareness that existed         the manufacturing of new clothes and household
           around recycling paper plastics glass and aluminum      goods so why are we so quick to throw them out
           in the 1980s and 1990s people couldnt imagine           as people become more knowledgeable on the impact
           recycling their cans or putting paper in a special bin   of their clothing consumption and disposal habits
           now it is the norm just as the issue of recycling was    their behaviors should change helping to reduce
           addressed with education so can the issue of textile     waste and continue moving toward a circular economy
           reuse and recycling be addressed over time with
           continued education and awareness                        the savers state of reuse report sheds light on
                                                                     these important questions provides more clarity on
           as a society were making progress on moving             misperceptions and suggests ways we can all give a
           towards a circular economy but theres still a long      shrt about our clothing footprint
4          way to go when it comes to the stewardship of                                                                               5
           valuable natural resources and changing consumer
           habits particularly around clothing and textile use
           and disposal

           when we throw away our used clothes and household
           goods we are also throwing away the raw materials
           used to make them consider the environmental
           impact of what goes into making a common everyday
