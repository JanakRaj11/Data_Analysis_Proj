 concise annual report 2002                      contents on page 8




this year westpac received around 4000 complaints a month from
customers and some 40 of them had to approach us four or more
times before their issue was fully acknowledged let alone
satisfactorily resolved

this is clear evidence that for all the progress we have made over
recent years and despite yet another record profit result we are still
falling well short of our customers expectation for better service

the reality is our staff share our customers frustration they want
to help but many feel they lack the tools and training they need
we could tell them they have to cope with the situation but then we
would lose some of our best people we could say we have higher
satisfaction ratings than most of our competitors but in truth its
only by a small margin we could say it doesnt really matter because
were still very profitable but we could easily see our profits evaporate
along with our reputation if we did

weve concluded we must act and act decisively our ongoing
prosperity depends on it we owe it to our customers and our
shareholders to make service quality a top priority but more than
anything we owe it to our staff to start a revolution they can all take
part in and be proud of this annual report is just the beginning

its a huge relief when a customer knows that one person is going to
 take ownership of their issue too often in the past they were left feeling
 its their problem not the banks and that no one wants to know

annalisa martello call centre representative

i must admit it was often easier to pass a customers problem on to someone
 else rather than taking responsibility for solving it myself knowing that im
 part of a team that wont tolerate this any more is changing everything

 jesse mccrimmon customer services representative

we did the impossible with our computer system to meet the y2k deadline
 and well do it again to build the systems that can bridge the gap between
 the bank and our customers so that it all works as it should

calvin cheung solutions delivery manager  webtop

of course a customer should only have to ask once but they should only
 have to give us their details once as well getting this right will instantly solve
 the most common complaint i hear from my customers when i ask them for
 information theyve already given the bank three times
 allan brown business banking manager

currently there are around 30 of us dedicated to resolving customer
 problems and complaints so imagine the power of having 25000 people
 dedicated to dealing with the issues before they even need to come to us

customers
will only
have to ask
once an
impossible
promise

a lot of people may think that only having to ask once is an impossibly ambitious
promise for a bank to make we dont think it is
our people have shown time and time again that with the right focus and support
they can achieve amazing things and rising to this challenge is no exception they
have shown they understand and believe in the value of great customer experiences
but this revolution in customer service wont happen on its own it requires a major
commitment from us if it is to become a reality this is why weve rethought our
business processes and are investing significantly in our people and technology to
achieve it we recognise that the time for big talk is over its now time for big actions
this year were using our report to set out our plan to deliver on our ask once
promise a brave initiative that will see everyone in westpac not just frontline staff
become better equipped to take ownership for delivering great customer outcomes
and resolving any problems customers may have this doesnt mean having to know
all the answers just where to find the answers ultimately it means whomever the
customer asks first about a problem will be the person who takes responsibility
for getting it solved
this will apply from the board down no exceptions let the revolution begin

chairmans report

seeing it like it is
while a significant portion of this report focuses on our strategy for dramatically
improving our customer experience and its link to shareholder value i would like
to take the opportunity to address an equally important issue that impacts on our
reputation that is the growing outrage in the community over what is seen as a
breakdown in the corporate oversight system people are understandably frustrated
and angry at what they see as a lack of corporate transparency and accountability
after a number of record corporate collapses poor disclosure practices and some
highly questionable behaviour by a few who can blame them
we are under no illusions with corporate integrity under question globally the
challenge facing australian business is to continually demonstrate a genuine
commitment to good governance and social responsibility both of which are
fundamental to our future




our result shows continued improvement and growth culminating           after all you cant regulate morality and poorly directed regulation
in our tenth consecutive annual profit improvement we have              is a recipe for complexity and cost what we need is a more

in doing so we have significantly enhanced our reputation and

will we be able to achieve even better results for our shareholders

our social impact report

a fresh perspective
our responsibility to the
society from which we profit




in july 2002 we issued our first social impact report a fresh
perspective showing clear measures of our performance against
more than 70 indicators covering social environmental and
economic dimensions

this report is one of the first to conform to the new sustainability
reporting guidelines developed within the global reporting initiative
framework we remain the only australian financial institution to
release such a report the following pages summarise some key
focus areas extracted from our full social impact report which is
available on our website at wwwwestpaccomau

we know that the task of ensuring the longerterm sustainability
of our company goes beyond just the financial dimension our
customers and the community more generally are telling us very
clearly that they expect us to take greater account of our impact
on society by improving the transparency of all our business
practices thereby charting a path to a healthy and sustainable
future for our company and the communities we serve
