              ment of how our activities have fulfilled our strategic objectives for
              a sustainable economy environment and community
              progress is measured both quantitatively and qualitatively against de
              sired outcomes and performance measures for each of the 17 strategic
              priorities this performance measuring and monitoring is the catalyst
              for continuous improvement in service delivery
              it is important to note that many of our goals are beyond councils
              direct control although evaluating how our efforts contribute to
              community outcomes is a key input into future planning
