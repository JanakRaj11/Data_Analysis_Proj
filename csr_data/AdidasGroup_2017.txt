                             based on the core belief that through sport we have
                             the power to change lives and we do this every day as
                             a company by empowering people to live an active life
                             by teaching life skills through sport and by creating
                             sustainable products our core belief becomes
                             particularly relevant when we talk about the impact
                             we have with our sustainability work we are one of
                             the very few companies that integrate sustainability
                             into their business model which is most visible in the
                             fact that we take sustainability to the product level

                         upon these results is a top priority of our sustainability strategy
                         for this reason we have put several programmes and procedures
                         in place to support our apparel and footwear suppliers

                         as part of the manufacturing excellence programme one target
                         is to achieve 50 water savings at apparel material suppliers

                         raw material processing we collaborate closely with our
                         apparel supplier base by educating them about best available
                         technologies and processes to strengthen their capabilities
                         as well as to improve water usage in the manufacturing of our
                         products this includes training and advising both our internal
                         colleagues and our suppliers on innovative methodologies and
                         technology options that are needed to save water over the past
                         36 months we have successfully promoted several procedures
                         tackling those areas considered critical in water processing and
                         usage in textile production all of them resulting in increased

final rejection rate this covers factories directly rejected after
the first visit that have no chance of a second visit as well as
factories rejected after being visited a second time at the end
of 2016 we had a final rejection rate of 4 this shows the
importance and impact of preapproval screening as well as
the effort taken by the suppliers to resolve issues and come into
conformance with our workplace standards the remediation
of factory issues is beneficial for workers as it raises the bar
in terms of better and timelier pay improved benefits reduced
hours and the legal protection of formal employment contracts

since we have limited control over the direct environmental
impacts of the manufacturing process and how our suppliers act
the best way to influence them is to encourage the introduction
of environmental management systems and we have made
implementing such a system mandatory for all our core
suppliers in order to achieve a certification for a management
system it requires factory managers to plan manage and review
