      sustainability aspects of methanol
      methanol is a clear colourless liquid chemical that is water         methanol can also be produced from renewable resources
      soluble and readily biodegradable the raw materials ie           like biomass landfill gas power plant emissions and c02 the
      natural gas water used to make methanol are natural                 challenges of developing renewable methanol include the scale
      resources that are shared with communities with changing             of its production its economics relative to competing fuels
      supply and demand for resources ensuring longterm security          and both policies and regulations regarding renewable fuels
      of these raw materials is key to our business                        feedstock availability ie biomass c02 is an additional market
                                                                            driver but in the case of renewable methanol is not expected
      as the global demand for energy continues to grow so does
                                                                            to be a primary limiting factor
      the demand for methanol as an alternative source of energy
      and fuel methanol is an attractive economically viable              the success of renewable methanol will require
      alternative that can provide fuel diversity reduce emissions             endtoend supply chain partnerships
      and increase consumer choice
                                                                                realistic timelines for scaleup of operations
      as a cleanburning fuel methanol can be blended directly into
      gasoline to produce a highoctane fuel that produces fewer                clear communication about intended products
      emissions than conventional gasoline methanol is also used to            targeted market entry strategies
      produce methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe a gasoline additive

                        in 2014 we continued to show solid progress in      at our plants employees and contractors work
                        developing our process safety management psm       alongside one another to complete complex
                        program including building knowledge and tracking   projects in 2013 we saw a heightened level

                        our global process safety effort has been largely    a variability in their skills and experience
                        focused on taking action on the internal gap         as a result contractor management has been a
                        assessment against the ccps psm guideline to        major focus over the past three years we believe

                        programs to that end we participated in a psm      impact in 2014 we had no major maintenance
                        benchmarking and training exercise with an           activities this allowed us the space and time to
                        external firm in 2015 we will use the results      implement further improvements however these
                        from the benchmarking to shape our longerterm       improvements have not been fully tested through

      following the restart of the idled waitara valley plant in october                          topics such as methanol safe handling responsible
   2013 we received concerns from some residents about the level of                              care and firefighting exercises
   noise being produced by the plant while we were in full compliance
   with noise regulations we decided that as part of our responsible care
   ethic to be a good neighbour we should undertake additional noise
   mitigation improvements
   plant areas targeted for noise modification were identified by an
   independent noise specialist during a noise mapping survey as a result
   steam vents were overhauled acoustic insulation was added to a number
   of valves a sound enclosure was built for a water pump gearbox and some
   fans were switched off subsequent monitoring has shown a reduction in
   offsite noise along with anecdotal feedback from neighbours that they
   are not noticing the plant noise as much
   in addition weve worked with neighbours on noise mitigation efforts
   in their homes and increased our engagement with the community
   this included visiting neighbours in their homes doing a presentation to                      geismar startup
   the waitara community board holding two open house evenings and
                                                                                                  we are active participants in geismars cap

   kept closely informed of activities happening there  by email phone and by mail we were     incidents and hiring activities we also brought in
   invited to view the plant and meet with staff who worked there which we did  we found        outside speakers to address topics of interest to
   this a fantastic experience and learned a lot we have also had methanex staff working with

methanex staff are working with the taranaki
regional council trc to enhance a twohectare
area of native forest that contains regionally
significant ecosystems habitats and species
in 2014 upon the completion of an ecological
assessment we began implementing a predator

        sharing responsible care values with communities in china
       to mark world environment day june 5 2014 methanex staff in shanghai beijing and hong kong
    teamed up with other members of the association of international chemical manufacturers aicm to
    share responsible care values with the public this halfday event which was held in the zhangjiagang
    free trade zone was attended by more than 200 people including local high school students and
    representatives of environmental groups and government agencies employees created a variety of
    games and activities to engage people in learning about methanol production and logistics and to
    discover how methanol is increasingly being used as an alternate clean energy transportation fuel
    during the session participants posted their thoughts about responsible care on a colourful board
    their heartfelt comments showed they clearly understood the values of responsible care 
    of always doing the right thing and putting our values and safety practices into action every day

            one of the most significant ways we can minimize           the increase was mainly due to gas curtailments
            our emissions is by ensuring the reliability of            in egypt particularly in the third quarter
            our production facilities and the efficiency of            which caused the plant to be taken offline for
            production processes in this way we not only             approximately 85 days throughout the year
            reduce our energy use but also our emissions              when plants are shut down they use more gas to
            such as carbon dioxide c02 nitrogen oxides n0x        restart operations which impacts emissions and

                   in 2014 we had zero reportable ie serious or
                   major spills this is a significant improvement
                   over 2013 when we had four reportable spills
                   we achieved this by thoroughly investigating the
                   incidents that occurred in 2013 identifying what
                   changes needed to happen and taking
                   preventative action
