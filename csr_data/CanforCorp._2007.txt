                       year with the decline in housing starts

                       prices for both lumber and osb also declined

                       in a profit of 4718 million after tax

compliance report

canfor is committed to transparency in our environmental reporting and includes compliance reporting as part of
this process the following is an inventory of compliance for canfors majority owned manufacturing operations
      in 2006 canfor had the following noncompliance situations reported in accordance with government non
compliance reporting criteria


air
at pulpmills  particulate emissions from a power boiler exceeded the permit limit on one quarterly stack test
at a pulpmill a small quantity of anhydrous ammonia was leaked to atmosphere as a result of a pinhole in a line
      at wood products operations one burner was below compliance temperature on seven occasions one
burner was below compliance temperature on three occasions and two burners exceeded smoke opacity limits
on one occasion each a power boiler exceeded smoke opacity limits on two occasions particulate from an osb
drier exceeded permit during three quarterly compliance tests a wet electrostatic precipitator at a plywood plant
was bypassed five times due to mechanical and electrical malfunctions weekly inspections on a sawmill planer
baghouse were not documented as required by permit for two weeks out of a six month period at a sawmill
visible emissions from two cyclones were observed by the ministry of environment


effluent
at pulpmills  in october 2006 canfor pulp limited partnership cplp observed dark ponded water in an area
on the banks of the fraser river and reported the dark ponded water to the appropriate regulatory agencies
the partnership also undertook certain remedial work and investigations to determine the source of the dark
ponded water the partnerships experts have concluded that the source is likely a leak from the partnerships
intercontinental mills ash pond
      the partnership in conjunction with the bc ministry of environment is considering and developing remedial
options the cost to remediate the ash pond and surrounding area cannot be determined at this time but the
partnership believes it will not have a material effect on its financial condition
      at a panel plant a quarterly effluent report was submitted after the due date at a sawmill significant
vegetation growth on a berm surrounding a sanitary lagoon was noted by the ministry of environment


landfill  no issues to report


spills
at manufacturing operations  canfor had 11 4 at pulpmills 7 at solid wood reportable spills in 2006 all were
contained cleaned up and preventive actions taken the spills included two spills of pulp stockfiltrate one spill of    0
a pulp process chemical one spill of untreated pulp mill effluent one spill of hydraulic oil two spills of transformer   canfor

                             particulate is considered a risk to human health ambient levels of odour constitute a nuisance and a potential
                             impediment to community growth despite significant emission reductions these levels have not improved
                             since condensate strippers were installed at the pulpmills in 1989 in order to identify cost effective reduction
                             strategies for odorous emissions we will initiate a study to characterize sources of odour at canfor operations

     report 2006

     over the past year canfor has remained dedicated to reducing emissions and finding innovative energy
solutions by increasing wood residue usage in the production of heat and electricity canfor was able to lessen
the need for traditional energy sources in 2006 canfor generated approximately 17 million tonnes of byproduct
wood residuals of which 70 or about 12 million tonnes was utilized for renewable heat and electricity
generation the production of wood pellets sawdust pulp and fibreboard utilization will increase in 2007 with
completion of the houston energy system pellet plant project and improved output of the prince george pulp
cogeneration facility
     canfor will continue to actively pursue value added opportunities for our remaining surplus wood residue

overview of 2006

2006 was an important year for canfor with several key accomplishments but also a year of difficult market conditions and operating
challenges prices for wood products deteriorated throughout the year which combined with the continued strength of the canadian
dollar contributed to weaker financial results the company experienced operating challenges from the beetleinfested wood
throughout central bc and in the startup of new technology and capital in its mills
      in 2006 the company continued to deliver on its strategy of focussing on the growth of its wood products business to this end
canfor reorganized its coastal assets and the nbsk pulp and paper assets were separated through the creation of the canfor pulp
income fund canfor then distributed fund units representing 498 of the pulp and paper business to its shareholders providing a
significant shareholder value return canfor acquired the new south group of companies in the carolinas diversifying product mix
and extending the companys manufacturing base into the united states furthermore a longterm resolution was negotiated in the
softwood lumber dispute which has provided a framework for greater certainty and with the duty refunds fully received financial
flexibility going forward with a strong balance sheet
      markets are expected to continue to be difficult through 2007 but the companys efforts are focused on reducing costs and
improving productivity and efficiency which combined with a loyal growing customer base will allow canfor to weather this downturn
another challenge in 2007 will be to deal with the impact of the mountain pine beetle the epidemic is well known but the ever
changing fibre quality impacts are not significant effort is going into understanding the beetle impacts both present and future for the
company


highlights

business with canfor owning the other 80

                       32 lower in 2006 and ended the year at 51 less than at the start of the year the decline in plywood prices was less dramatic with
                       prices averaging 5 lower in the year as a result of the poor pricing environment market curtailments were taken in the year which
                       reduced production by 116 million board feet of lumber 84 million square feet of osb and 6 million square feet of plywood the results
                       excluding the duty refund for the lumber and panels segments decreased by 3427 million in 2006 to a combined operating loss of
                       1858 million
                              in contrast strong pulp markets in 2006 resulted in an excellent year for the pulp and paper segment pulp prices rose throughout
                       the year averaging 12 higher than 2005 and closing the year 22 higher than at the start of the year as a result the pulp and paper

in addition to exposure to foreign exchange and changes in product prices canfors financial results are impacted by seasonal factors
such as weather and building activity adverse weather conditions can cause logging curtailments which can affect the supply of raw
materials to sawmills plywood and osb plants and pulp mills market demand also varies seasonally to some degree for example
building activity and repair and renovation work which affects demand for lumber and panel products is generally stronger in the spring
and summer months shipment volumes are affected by these factors as well as by global supply and demand conditions shortages

the segments operating income before the duty recovery declined by 264 million from 2005 driven largely by the impact of
unfavourable changes in both market prices and the us exchange rate the aggregate negative impact of marketrelated indicators
totalled just over 186 million when comparing 2006 with 2005 and the resulting marketrelated curtailments contributed to a 4
unfavourable production variance to 2005 further impacting financial performance relative to 2005 was the impact of a 13 reduction

softwood lumber agreement sla  return of duty deposits
effective october 12 2006 the governments of canada and the united states implemented an agreement for the settlement of the softwood
lumber dispute which began in may 2002 the softwood lumber agreement sla which received formal approval by the canadian
parliament on december 14 2006 has a term of seven years and provides for an extension of two years either government can give notice
to terminate the sla after 23 months but there is an additional 12month notice period before the agreement can be terminated
       under the terms of the sla the us department of commerce revoked all existing antidumping add and countervailing cvd duty
orders on softwood lumber shipped to the us from canada approximately 81 of deposits paid together with accumulated interest
were to be returned to canadian lumber producers the remaining 19 us 1 billion was to be retained by the us government for
distribution to the us forest industry petitioners and for use in funding meritorious activities such as disaster relief the promotion
of sustainable forestry management and low income housing approximately us 40 million will be utilized for a joint uscanada
committee designed to strengthen and build the north american lumber market
       in the fourth quarter the full amount of the duty deposits and accumulated interest was refunded by the us government with the
us 1 billion repayable by the canadian producers as a special assessment to be collected by the canadian government at december 31
2006 canfor had received cash of us 9215 million and had accrued us 1640 million for this assessment which was paid to the canadian   27

                       new export tax structure under the sla
                       the sla requires that effective october 12 2006 an export tax on lumber shipped to the us be collected by the government of canada
                       and returned to the province of origin of the lumber the province of bc had the right to choose between an export charge only option
                       a or a lower export charge with a quota option b for each of the bc coast and bc interior regions the province of bc chose option a
                       for both the bc coast and the bc interior and will have the opportunity to change options on january 1 2010 and january 1 2013
                             the export tax rate is determined monthly and is based on the random lengths framing lumber composite price as follows

                             the sla also includes a surge mechanism which increases the export tax rate for the month by 50 when the monthly volume

                       have been subject to the highest export tax bracket of 15 with no applicable surge increase since the agreement began as a result
                       of the current low composite pricing levels canfor expensed export taxes of 220 million in 2006 subsequent to the implementation

                       markets
                       canfor markets lumber products throughout north america and overseas in addition to its own production canfor also markets lumber
                       produced from independent mills in north america and offshore countries to complement its product line in 2006 approximately 78
                       of canfors lumber sales were made to the us market and 13 to the canadian market virtually all lumber destined for north america
                       was shipped by rail and truck the remaining 9 of shipments went offshore principally to japan but also to korea china taiwan and
                       europe offshore modes of transportation consisted of 85 by container ship and 15 by breakbulk vessel
                             with the addition of new south companies in march of 2006 canfor expanded its product mix with the introduction of southern
                       yellow pine syp lumber and established a base for lumber imports from overseas sales of spf lumber produced by canfor were down
                       by 5 over 2005 as a result of lower production however the acquisition of new south companies increased the total sales of lumber
                       by 11 for the year
                             lumber markets deteriorated from the pace set in 2005 market demand declined slightly in the first half of the year and
                       deteriorated further during the second half of the year as the number of new homes constructed dropped significantly home prices
                       have been steadily rising in the past two years with recent increases largely fueled by housing investment speculators as housing
                       affordability declined many consumers were forced out of the market as a result inventories of new homes increased and new home
                       construction declined in many parts of the us particularly in the second half of 2006 total annual housing starts were 18 million units 8

                       starts increased slightly in 2006 from 2255 million units to 2274 million units 9
                             the repair and remodeling sector of the housing market remained strong throughout 2006 although the two sectors typically
                       follow each other repair and remodeling expenditures were buoyed by high levels of existing home sales during 2005 and 2006
                       canfors lumber sales to home centre retailers increased in 2006 compared to 2005 and sales to the other market segments were

operating performance
spf lumber production decreased by 164 million board feet or 4 from the prior year as a result of the unfavourable market
environment production curtailments representing approximately 116 million board feet of lumber were taken in 2006 the other
significant factors in the lower production are the effects of shift reductions and the plateau mills 9day shutdown in the second quarter
of 2006 to complete work on the capital project
     one of canfors key operating performance indicators is the percentage of prime lumber or higher grade such as square edge
jgrade machine stress rated lumber and select studs that its mills produce in 2006 this percentage improved moderately over
2005 however two other key performance indicators in the areas of fibre recovery and mill productivity were both down slightly from
2005 levels fibre recovery is a measure that looks at the volume of lumber returned per cubic meter of log processed and productivity
is a measure of lumber production per labour hour this combination of lower productivity and market curtailments contributed to an
increase in unit conversion costs the most significant factors in the decrease in recovery and productivity in 2006 were the impact of
the smaller dryer beetle infested logs and the longer than expected startup curve at the plateau mill following the mill rebuild
     during the fourth quarter the grande prairie fingerjoint line which had an annual capacity of 9 million board feet of lumber was
closed indefinitely due to the difficult operating and market conditions
     capital spending in 2006 totalled 769 million compared to 1587 million in 2005 the major project in 2006 the houston pellet
plant commenced operation in the fourth quarter the second phase of the project includes a new energy system which has an
anticipated startup date of march 2007                                                                                                      29

                       operating income in the panels segment declined by 787 million in 2006 primarily as a result of the sharp decline in osb prices

                              the north american structural panel market was like the lumber market affected by the decline in the housing market particularly
                       during the latter half of 2006 considerable osb capacity has come on stream during the past two years and although there were mill
                       curtailments in the fourth quarter there was still a surplus of supply in the market  consequently the 2006 price of osb averaged us

        canfor
                       supply with demand and resulted in higher prices for the fourth quarter of 2006 the average price during 2006 for 38 plywood delivered

operating performance
plywood  ebitda as a percentage of sales dropped 3 from 2005 driven largely by market prices and chip prices despite scheduled

maintenance downtime at the north central plywood operation not taken in the prior year productivity improvements over 2005 drove a
modest gain in total plywood production an improvement in prime product yield helped to minimize the negative impact of the canadian
dollars appreciation against the us dollar and the 20 decline in plywood pricing
      a decision was made late in the fourth quarter to move to a modified shift schedule at the tackama plywood plant which will reduce the
total operating hours by approximately 30 commencing january 2007 the change is expected to reduce costs and improve productivity


osb  ebitda as a percentage of sales fell from 25 in 2005 to 45 in 2006 with a selling price decline of over 140 per msf being

the most significant factor although the polarboard facility lost nearly a month of production due to a fire and mechanical failures
and a further 4 weeks to market curtailment gains in both productivity and efficiency were achieved over 2005 along with a moderate
improvement in unit cash conversion costs polarboards operating performance in 2005 was impacted by its capacity expansion project
and various startup issues and mechanical failures
      peace valley osb continues to make anticipated and steady progress on its startup the mill was operating at expected levels at
the end of 2006 and is anticipated to be operating at its designed production capacity in early 2008 overall steady progress is expected
to continue as the mill works at improving its uptime efficiency product quality and costs
      also included in the panels segment is the panel and fibre operation which produces hardboard panelboard and erosion control
products the operation recorded a relatively small loss for the year which was largely attributable to the writedown of assets
constituting the woodmat business which will be discontinued in mid2007 as a result of automakers phasing out woodbased panels
in the doors of premium cars an automatic bagger project implemented on the ecofibre line of business in 2006 is anticipated to result
in improved earnings in 2007

 report 2006

     operating income of the pulp and paper segment increased by 1197 million when compared to 2005 results strong performance
at all mills including an annual record for total tonnes produced combined with improved markets and lower costs and a 12 increase
in the average pulp list price were partially offset by the strengthening canadian dollar sales were also favourably impacted by the
shift of a higher volume of sales to north american markets primarily at the expense of europe which resulted in higher revenues as
the north american market list prices averaged us 34 per tonne higher than those in europe overall costs were favourable to 2005
primarily due to the beneficial impact of lower chip prices lower overall maintenance expense and lower energy costs resulting from
the full year of operation of the cogeneration project at the prince george pulp mill


markets
cplp experienced strong and improved demand during 2006 compared to 2005 this was partly driven by increased consumption from
europe and asia but was mostly due to the large reduction in canadian nbsk production capacity approximately 1 million tonnes or
16 of canadian capacity was shut down in 2006 primarily as a result of mill closures in eastern canada due to high fibre and energy
costs and the negative effect on sales prices resulting from the strengthening canadian dollar
     list prices increased in all markets during 2006 with the benchmark price for nbsk pulp delivered into northern europe averaging
us 683 per tonne in 2006 compared to us 611 in 2005 inventory levels for nbsk pulp declined to 24 days of supply with 30 days of
supply generally considered to be a balanced market

operating performance
an annual production record for total tonnes highlighted 2006 surpassing the previous record set in 2004 by 20000 tonnes nbsk
production during the year was 32200 tonnes higher than 2005 as a result of improved performance and reliability at all facilities and
the ramp up of the prince george pulp mill to its full rate from its curtailed production in 2005 due to the precipitator installation total
maintenance downtime for the prince george mills was 39 days in 2006 the same as 2005 the pulp mills have moved to an 18month
cycle for major maintenance outages and stagger these between the three mills with one facility missing a major shut each year
     production of bctmp at the taylor mill fell by 6 in 2006 to 194400 tonnes equipment failures chip supply and quality issues
maintenance downtime of 9 days 2005  8 days and a 3day production curtailment over the christmas period due to a shortage of chip
supply and market conditions were the main reasons for the reduced production
     the cogeneration facility at the prince george pulp mill operated for the full year in 2006 averaging 919 megawatt hours per day
compared to 788 in 2005 the facility was commissioned in 2005 and commenced power generation in may 2005 a 4day outage was
taken in december 2006 to allow for the installation of improvements to upgrade the ash handling system which contributed to the
reduced power generation during the fourth quarter additional modifications to the cogeneration system are expected during 2007 to
further improve its performance
     in 2006 the paper machine produced 1700 tonnes more than in 2005 operations continue to focus on higher margin bleached

                       2007 outlook

                       the market price environment for wood products is expected to continue to be difficult through 2007 canfor is focusing its efforts on
                       reducing costs improving productivity and efficiency which combined with a loyal and growing customer base will allow the company
                       to weather this downturn in the cycle another challenge in 2007 will be the impact of the mountain pine beetle the epidemic is well
                       known but the everchanging fibre quality impacts are not significant resources are being devoted to this issue canfors strong balance

                       lumber markets
                       housing construction forecasters14 believe that the us housing market is expected to remain at current levels until the second half of
                       2007 the inventory of unsold homes is predicted to decline and once that has occurred new home construction is anticipated to increase
                       through the latter part of 2007 and into 2008 canadian housing starts are forecast to decrease by approximately 10 in 2007 the
                       outlook for the repair and remodeling market for 2007 is more positive than for new housing construction but overall spending in that
                       sector is projected to be 4 lower than in 2006 largely because of reduced consumer confidence and lower existing home sales
                              the supply of lumber from canada shipped to the us is expected to be lower in 2007 because of the effect of the softwood lumber
                       agreement sla recently implemented with the united states as discussed earlier under the sla if lumber prices fall below certain
                       thresholds canadian shipments to the us are subject to increasing levels of export tax in addition if actual shipments are higher than
                       a calculated maximum shipment volume set for each month an additional surge tax will be added in times of low lumber prices and
                       higher taxes it is possible that the canadian industry will be forced to curtail production in order to reduce financial losses
                              the supply of european lumber into north american markets has declined significantly and is expected to continue to be minimal
                       during 2007 considerable log shortages in europe strong domestic demand the eurous exchange rate and low north american prices
                       are expected to keep most european produced lumber in their domestic market demand is also anticipated to remain strong from
                       asian markets total housing starts in japan are expected to surpass those in 2006 particularly in the 2x4 housing market it is believed
                       that canadian demand for lumber will remain steady as housing starts are predicted to remain above 200000 units15  particularly in
                       western canada as a result of strong oil and gas activity as a result north american lumber prices are expected to improve in the
                       second half of 2007


                       panel markets
                       the nearterm outlook for structural panels in 2007 is positive as a seasonal increase in both plywood and osb demand is expected in
                       time for the spring construction season the second half of 2007 should show an increase in demand as us housing starts are projected
                       to increase above current levels however additional new osb capacity is expected to start up in 2007 which will put further pressure
                       on the already depressed market although the supply for plywood will be more balanced in 2007 resulting from the shutdown of two
                       canadian mills in the fourth quarter of 2006 the low price of osb will continue to put downward pressure on plywood


                       pulp markets
                       in january 2007 list price increases were announced in all markets for northern europe a us 3040 increase was announced which
                       will take prices to us 760770 per tonne in the united states a us 20 increase will bring prices to us 790 the asian markets also
                       saw a us 20 list price increase announcement which would take prices to us 730760 depending on the country of delivery looking
                       ahead into 2007 it is believed that demand and pricing will hold up well through the first half of the year while global economies are
                       projected to slow somewhat the year is beginning with very low global inventories and nbsk market pulp is expected to continue to be
                       in short supply some moderation in prices is expected in the second half of 2007

2006 nonsegmented items

corporate  other costs
corporate and other costs of 393 million which are comprised of corporate head office and information technology costs increased
by 26 million in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of recording 29 million of additional severance and lease costs related to the

the duty interest the net interest expense of 415 million was 07 million lower than the net expense of 422 million in 2005
     the 415 million expense in 2006 is net of interest income of 83 million which was 44 million lower than in 2005 due to the
lower cash and cash equivalents balance in the first 10 months of the year longterm debt interest of 406 million was expensed in
2006 or 90 million less than in 2005 as a result of principal reductions and the impact of the stronger canadian dollar on us dollar
interest payments other interest expenses of 92 million in 2006 were primarily related to shortterm borrowings credit facility and
letter of credit fees standby charges and interest penalties on tax reassessments which increased by 33 million in total over 2005

                       unusual expense 2005
                       the unusual expense of 88 million 62 million after tax recorded in 2005 was for the loss on timber taken back by the government
                       of british columbia the crown following the introduction of its forestry revitalization plan in 2003 in which licensees including canfor
                       were required to return 20 of their aac from replaceable tenures to the crown approximately half of this volume was redistributed to
                       create opportunities for woodlots community forests and first nations and the other half was made available for public auction
                             the effect of the timber takeback resulted in a reduction of approximately 24 million cubic metres to canfors existing aac on
                       its replaceable tenures canfor worked with the government to identify those licenses and operating areas that were to be returned to
                       the crown and negotiations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 canfor received compensation of 570 million for the loss
                       of tenures and a 50 million payment against lost infrastructure and road construction costs canfor does not expect that the take
                       back will adversely affect its ability to obtain adequate timber supplies for its operations in the future or materially affect the costs of

                       canfors ratio of current assets to current liabilities at 221 at the end of 2006 was slightly lower than the 2005 ratio of 241 mainly
                       due to the income tax payable of 2354 million compared to 41 million in 2005 and the accrual of the special duty assessment of
                       1867 million as discussed earlier
                             as a result of the duty refund received in the last two months of the year canfors net debt was in a negative position resulting

increase in income taxes payable a 288 million decrease in inventories and a 1617 million increase in accounts payable the

the decrease in inventories is mainly as a result of the sawmill curtailments during the christmas period the increase in income taxes
payable reflects the taxes payable on the duty refund and associated interest while the increase in accounts payable is primarily due
to the 1877 million us 1640 million special duty assessment accrual as discussed in the lumber segment partially offset by
reductions in other payables income tax payments of 80 million were made in the year 2005  28 million and net interest received

       the reforestation liability is a fluctuating obligation based on the volume of timber harvested the future cash outflows are a
       function of the actual costs of silviculture programs and of harvesting at the time and are based on among other things the
       location of the harvesting

critical accounting estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with canadian generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recorded in the financial statements management regularly reviews these
estimates and assumptions based on currently available information while it is reasonably possible that circumstances may arise which
cause actual results to differ from these estimates management does not believe it is likely that any such differences will materially
affect canfors financial position


employee future benefits
canfor has various defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing both pension and other retirement benefits to most of its
salaried employees and certain hourly employees not covered by forest industry union plans canfor also provides certain health care
benefits and pension bridging benefits to eligible retired employees the costs and related obligations of the pension and other retirement
benefit plans are accrued in accordance with the recommendations of the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica
       canfor uses independent actuarial firms to perform actuarial valuations of the fair value of pension and other retirement benefit
plan obligations the application of these recommendations requires judgments regarding certain assumptions that affect the accrued
benefit provisions and related expenses including the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the obligations the expected
rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase and the assumed health care cost trend rates management and the
board of directors pension committee evaluate these assumptions annually based on experience and the recommendations of its
actuarial firms changes in these assumptions result in actuarial gains or losses which are amortized over the average remaining
service period of the active employee group covered by the plans only to the extent that the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses
are in excess of 10 of the greater of the accrued benefit obligations and the marketrelated value of plan assets

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying
value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparison of their net book value to the estimated future cash flows
generated by their use impaired assets are recorded at fair value determined principally using discounted future cash flows expected
from their use and eventual disposition


changes in accounting policies

effective january 1 2007

financial instruments
the cica has issued three new handbook sections which will apply to canfor as of january 1 2007 section 3855 financial instruments
section 3865 hedges and section 1530 comprehensive income section 3855 prescribes when a financial instrument should be
recognized on the balance sheet and at what amount it also specifies how to present financial instrument gains and losses section
3865 which is optional provides alternative treatments to section 3855 for when qualifying transactions are designated as hedges for
accounting purposes section 1530 introduces new requirements for situations when certain gains and losses must be temporarily
presented outside of net income in a new statement of comprehensive income which will be presented with equal prominence to the
regular income statement
      canfor has elected not to utilize hedge accounting on its existing derivative financial instruments which are discussed below under
financial market risk as a result these instruments which were previously not recognized on the balance sheet and gains and losses
were not recognized until the contracts were exercised will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value at january 1 2007 the fair
value of these derivative instruments amounted to 39 million representing unrealized losses which will be recorded as an opening
retained earnings adjustment with changes in fair value to be subsequently recorded in the income statement
      at december 31 2006 canfor had a deferred unrealized foreign exchange loss on longterm debt of 142 million on its balance
sheet as a result of terminating a previous hedging relationship under the accounting rules in existence in 2002 deferred financing costs
of 28 million were also recorded at december 31 2006 as a result of implementing section 3855 these balances will be transferred
to opening retained earnings at january 1 2007 the foreign exchange translation adjustment on the balance sheet 30 million at
december 31 2006 will be transferred to the opening balance of accumulated other comprehensive income
      the aggregate opening retained earnings adjustment resulting from the implementation of the new policy on january 1 2007 is
approximately 15 million net of future income taxes


effective january 1 2006

no new accounting policies were adopted in 2006


cash and cash equivalents
the presentation of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet was amended in 2006 to exclude shortterm investments with
maturity dates greater than 90 days from the original acquisition date with changes in these balances presented as investing activities
on the cash flow statement the definition of cash and cash equivalents on the cash flow statement was also amended to exclude credit
facilities labeled as operating bank loans on the balance sheet with changes in these balances now presented as financing activities
these changes in presentation reduced the prior years cash and cash equivalents balance on the balance sheet by 74 million and by
40 million on the cash flow statement

                       on its business operations from and believes that it is well positioned to deal with such matters as may arise


                       aboriginal issues
                       canadian judicial decisions have recognized the continued existence in the country of aboriginal title and rights to lands continuously
                       used or occupied by aboriginal groups as a result aboriginal groups have claimed aboriginal title and rights over substantial portions
                       of british columbia including areas where canfors forest tenures and other operations are situated these decisions have added to
                       uncertainty regarding property rights in canada including forest tenure and other resource rights particularly in those areas where
                       treaties have not been concluded with aboriginal groups such as much of british columbia the courts have also confirmed that a duty
                       to consult with aboriginal groups arises when the crown has knowledge of the potential existence of an aboriginal right or title and
                       contemplates conduct that might adversely impact it but has not extended this duty to third parties such as forest companies
                             as issues relating to aboriginal rights title and consultation continue to be heard developed and resolved in canadian courts
                       canfor will continue to cooperate communicate and exchange information and views with aboriginal groups and government in order
                       to foster good relationships and minimize risks to its tenures and operational plans and will continue to participate with the crown in
                       its consultation processes including aboriginal groups due to their complexity it is not expected that the issues regarding aboriginal
                       rights and title or consultation will be finally resolved in short term and accordingly the impact of these issues on the timber supply
                       from crown lands and canfors tenures and on canfors operations is unknown at this time
                             canfor believes in building mutually beneficial and lasting relationships with local first nations with treaty and aboriginal rights or
                       whose interests overlap with canfors areas of operations canfor has also formalized some of its relationships with aboriginal people
                       through agreements that generally seek to increase first nations participation in canfors planning and harvesting activities while
                       strengthening canfors access to fibre canfor also has numerous business relationships ranging from short and longterm contracts
                       with aboriginal businesses to jointly holding forest licenses with local first nations currently canfor is in the process of assessing
                       and analyzing canfors relationships with aboriginal peoples and is developing a corporate strategy to monitor assess and address
                       risks and opportunities involving first nations
                             consistent with canfors belief in seeking opportunities to improve its relationships with aboriginal peoples canfor has created
            44         and filled a permanent position for a manager of aboriginal affairs to advise canfor and assist in negotiations and strategy development

chip revenues
wood chips are a byproduct of canfors lumber manufacturing process and are primarily sold to cplp these chips are the principal
raw material utilized by cplp in its pulp manufacturing operations canfor has a fibre supply agreement with cplp which contains
a pricing formula that currently results in cplp paying canfor market prices for wood chips and also contains a provision to adjust the
pricing formula to reflect market conditions canfor currently provides approximately 65 of cplps chip requirements if lumber market
conditions are such that canfor is unable to provide the current volume of chips to cplp as a result of sawmill closures whether temporary
or permanent cplps financial results could be materially affected similarly if cplp were to cease pulp operations for an extended period
of time canfor would have a limited market for its chip supply and this could affect its ability to run the sawmills economically


environmental issues
the species at risk act sara was proclaimed by the government of canada in june 2003 the purpose of the act is to prevent the
extinction or extirpation of wildlife species present in canada for at least 50 years to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are
extirpated endangered or threatened as a result of human activity and encourage the management of other species to prevent them
from becoming at risk the economic implications of sara are potential reductions in timber harvests and increases in harvesting costs
none of which can be predicted at this time
     in december 2002 the government of canada ratified the kyoto agreement the climate change plan for canada which set
out canadas kyoto implementation strategy indicated that federal and provincial energy and environment ministers endorsed the
principle that companies that had taken early action should not be disadvantaged by an outputbased emissions regime canfor was an
early signatory to the climate change voluntary challenge and registry program a federal program introduced in 1997 to encourage
companies to inventory and track their greenhouse gas emissions ghgs and take actions to stabilize and reduce those emissions
canfor has implemented projects that have improved energy efficiency and displaced purchased fossil fuel energy with renewable
biomass energy thereby reducing ghg emissions both on absolute and per unit of production bases canfor has opportunities to further
reduce ghg emissions particularly through increased utilization of sawmill wood residuals
     in november 2003 the forest products association of canada fpac on behalf of canfor and other forest products companies
signed a memorandum of understanding respecting action on climate change mou with the federal government the mou
established a framework for expected upcoming negotiations of a pulp and paper sector covenant with the federal government the mou
specified that the government of canada will work with fpac parties and other industries to design a system that will not disadvantage
those firms that have taken early action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the change of government that occurred in early 2006
has resulted in uncertainty about whether the 2003 mou signed between fpac and the then liberal government will be honored by the
current conservative government the conservative government issued a notice of intent noi in october 2006 to regulate priority air
pollutants and ghgs under a clean air act to protect the health of canadians and the environment the noi establishes short 2010 
2015 medium 2020  2025 and longterm after 2050 time frames for the regulation of ghgs and priority pollutants the forest
products sector is named as one of the targeted sectors for regulation but it is anticipated that the government will consult with the
industry prior to setting the regulations the frameworks for shortterm regulations and specific shortterm emission reduction targets
are expected to be announced early in 2007 followed by consultation with industry sectors and the public

                            the air quality forum process that the pulp and paper sector has undertaken with nongovernmental organizations and the federal
                       government over the past two years has generated data and information that could be used to develop emission reduction targets the
                       wood products sector has been gathering data with environment canada but substantial further data gathering is necessary to provide
                       a basis for future regulatory targets it is expected that the pulp and paper sector regulatory timeline would be earlier in the short
                       term target window 2010  2015 as above and for wood products later in the shortterm window it is unclear at this time what the
                       specific regulatory targets will be and the related economic impact on canfor and on the industry there is the potential that the federal
                       government could offer incentives such as the recently announced renewable power production incentive and mechanisms such as
                       emission trading to help mitigate the impact of future air emission reduction regulations furthermore some of the parameters targeted
                       for federal regulation are already regulated by provincial jurisdictions to avoid duplication between federal and provincial regulatory
                       jurisdictions equivalency agreements would need to be signed
                            canadawide standards have been established by the government of canada for respirable particulate pm 25 and ozone levels
                       in the ambient air which will become effective in 2010 it is not clear how the canadawide standards will interrelate with the pending
                       federal clean air act and related regulations and targets
                            canfor has two remaining tier 1 burners in british columbia and is one of three companies utilizing a third tier 1 burner located
                       at another companys premises tier 1 burners are regulated by the bc ministry of environment for phase out by december 31 2007
                       one of the two canfor tier 1 burners at its houston sawmill will be shut down before the end of 2007 with the startup of the houston
                       pellet joint venture in september 2006 and a barkfired energy system at the houston sawmill in march 2007 it is anticipated that the
                       cooperative burner located in quesnel will not be required beyond 2007 because of local demand that will utilize surplus wood residuals
                       in the area canfor is seeking economically viable solutions for the remaining tier 1 burner at its fort st john sawmill


                       financial market risk
                       demand for forest products both wood products and pulp and paper is closely related to global business conditions and tends to be
                       cyclical in nature product prices can be subject to volatile change canfor like the majority of the canadian forest products industry
                       competes in a global market and the majority of its products are sold in us dollars consequently changes in foreign currency
                       relationships can impact canfors revenues and earnings


                       financial instruments
                       subject to risk management policies approved by its board of directors canfor from time to time uses simple derivative instruments
                       such as forward exchange contracts and futures contracts to hedge future movements of exchange rates and commodity prices
                            at december 31 2006 canfor had entered into pulp swaps to hedge future pulp sales along with matching us dollar forward exchange
                       contracts there was a combined unrealized loss of 10 million on the pulp swaps and forward contracts at the end of the period
                            at december 31 2006 canfor had entered into energy derivatives to hedge future natural gas and diesel purchases there were
                       unrealized losses of 29 million on these contracts respectively at the end of the period
                            since canfors longterm debt is primarily fixed in rate there is no significant impact to net income when interest rates change

government regulation
canfor is subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations
imposed by federal provincial and local authorities including those governing the use storage handling generation treatment
emission release discharge and disposal of certain hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contaminated soil and ground
water and the health and safety of employees if canfor is unable to extend or renew a material approval licence or permit required
by such laws or if there is a delay in renewing any material approval licence or permit canfors business financial condition results
of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected future events such as any changes in these laws and regulations
or any change in their interpretation or enforcement or the discovery of currently unknown conditions may give rise to additional
expenditures or liabilities


income trust taxation
on october 31 2006 the canadian federal government announced proposed plans to apply a tax on distributions from publicly traded
income trusts such as the canfor pulp income fund for existing income trusts the government is proposing a fouryear transition
period until the 2011 taxation year before the tax would be applicable


labour agreements and competition for professional and skilled labour

production levels and results of operations canfors various collective agreements with the uswa united steelworkers of america the
cep communications energy and paperworkers union and ppwc pulp paper and woodworkers of canada have terms expiring in
april 2008 and june 2009 any future inability to negotiate acceptable contracts could result in a strike or work stoppage by the affected
workers and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to unionized workers

                       mountain pine beetle
                       the infestation of mountain pine beetle dendroctonus ponderosae has reached critical levels in many timber supply areas throughout
                       the interior of british columbia and in some of canfors operating areas the impact of this outbreak is expected to affect the longterm
                       timber supply in the interior of british columbia
                            the mountain pine beetle has attacked much of the mature lodgepole pine forest throughout the interior of british columbia and
                       is now emerging in the western regions of alberta once attacked the pine trees typically die within 1 to 2 years
                            in response to the infestation bcs provincial government has significantly increased the allowable annual cut aac levels in the
                       heavily affected timber supply areas the increase is designed to salvage as much of the dead and damaged lodgepole pine timber as
                       possible and to direct harvesting in an attempt to reduce the spread of the beetle as a result canfor has also significantly increased
                       its harvest of dead pine within many of its operating areas
                            a recent timber supply study conducted by the council of forest industries cofi has analyzed the general trends of the mountain
                       pine beetle outbreak and forecasts the expected impacts on aac the study predicts that the timber supply areas surrounding
                       vanderhoof and quesnel will experience a significant reduction in aac in the next 10 to 15 years this reduction is expected because
                       these timber supplies consist of over 60 mature lodgepole pine that is either dead or at risk of attack and the remaining stands of
                       spruce balsam fir and douglas fir are insufficient to support historic harvest levels the timber supplies surrounding prince george
                       and mackenzie have the advantage of log diameter and a large inventory of nonpine species as a result there is more flexibility in
                       these timber supply areas to harvest other stands while the pine sites recover from the infestation the study also predicts that most of
                       the damaged pine volume in these areas could be recovered which may in turn mitigate the need for a significant reduction in harvest
                       levels as a result the study predicts that in 10 to 15 years the aac in the prince george timber supply areas will likely reduce to slightly
                       below historic levels and in the mackenzie areas the aac will remain unchanged other timber supply areas where canfor has operating
                       areas such as in fort nelson fort st john and chetwynd are not expected to experience a reduction in harvest levels resulting from
                       the current mountain pine beetle infestation
                            a major assumption about the impact on harvest levels is the shelf life of the dead pine shelf life represents the length of time
                       the timber is usable for a given product one of the determining factors that contribute to shelf life is the moisture condition of the area
                       where the timber is located the impact of moisture variability on the shelf life of timber is still being studied but indications are that it
                       can vary from 3 to 15 years depending on the moisture levels for alternative products such as wood chips for pulp production and bio
                       energy opportunities the shelf life is expected to be much longer
                            given the nature and extent of the infestation its longterm operational and financial impact on canfor is not quantifiable at this
                       time but could be significant


                       obligations to bc hydro
                       under a cogeneration agreement with bc hydro if the cogeneration project at the prince george pulp mill generates less than 390
                       gwh in any year and the shortfall cannot be made up by excess generation of up to 390 gwh in prior years or excess generation in the
                       subsequent year cplp is required to pay bc hydro an amount equal to 327 million multiplied by the ratio of the uncorrected shortfall
                       to the annual requirement of 390 gwh as of december 31 2006 cplp has no repayment obligation under the terms of the agreement

stumpage rates
the british columbia government introduced a market pricing system mps for the bc interior on july 1 2006 canfor is actively
participating in discussions on mps with the ministry of forests which is scheduled for its first annual update on july 1 2007 canfor
will continue to seek to manage and reduce the stumpage costs for its interior operations under the stumpage appraisal system the
nearterm imperative is to ensure that the stumpage system accurately reflects the market value of timber and is responsive to the
deteriorating quality of the beetleimpacted fibre


surge tax
as discussed earlier the sla includes a surge mechanism which increases the export tax by 50 when the monthly volume of exports
from a region exceeds a certain trigger volume as defined in the sla the surge tax is applied retroactively for all shipments during the
month when the surge occurred canfor utilizes a daily tracking system developed by the canadian governments department of foreign
affairs and international trade to manage its shipment volumes so as not to trigger the surge tax in addition the governments of bc
and alberta are sending out daily warnings to all exporters when it appears that there is a possibility of a surge however the total
volume of exports from the region including shipments from canfors competitors cannot be estimated with complete certainty


transportation services
canfor relies primarily on third parties for transportation of its products as well as delivery of raw materials a significant portion of
which are transported by railroad trucks and ships if any of canfors third party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the
raw materials or products or distribute them in a timely manner canfor may be unable to sell those products at full value or at all or
unable to manufacture its products in response to customer demand which could have a material adverse effect on canfors financial
condition and operating results in addition if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with canfor
canfor may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost

                       possible that circumstances may arise which cause actual results to differ from management estimates however management does
                       not believe it is likely that such differences will materially affect canfors financial position

section 3865 hedges and section 1530 comprehensive income section 3855 prescribes when a financial instrument should be
recognized on the balance sheet and at what amount it also specifies how to present financial instrument gains and losses section
3865 which is optional provides alternative treatments to section 3855 for when qualifying transactions are designated as hedges for
accounting purposes section 1530 introduces new requirements for situations when certain gains and losses must be temporarily
presented outside of net income in a new statement of comprehensive income which will be presented with equal prominence to the
regular income statement
      canfor has elected to not utilize hedge accounting on its existing derivative financial instruments note 23 as a result these
instruments which were previously not recognized on the balance sheet and gains and losses were not recognized until the contracts
were exercised will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value at january 1 2007 the fair value of these derivative instruments
amounted to 39 million which will be recorded as an opening retained earnings adjustment with changes in fair value to be
subsequently recorded in the income statement
      at december 31 2006 canfor had a deferred unrealized foreign exchange loss on longterm debt of 142 million on its balance
sheet as a result of terminating a previous hedging relationship under the accounting rules in existence in 2002 deferred financing costs
of 28 million were also recorded at december 31 2006 as a result of implementing section 3855 these balances will be transferred
to opening retained earnings at january 1 2007 the foreign exchange translation adjustment on the balance sheet 30 million at
december 31 2006 will be transferred to the opening balance of accumulated other comprehensive income

the forestry revitalization plan
in march 2003 the government of british columbia the crown introduced the forestry revitalization plan the plan that provides for
significant changes to crown forest policy and to the existing allocation of crown timber tenures to licensees the changes prescribed
in the plan include the elimination of minimum cut control regulations the elimination of existing timber processing regulations and
the elimination of restrictions limiting the transfer and subdivision of existing licenses through legislation licensees were required to
return 20 of their replaceable tenure to the crown the plan states that approximately half of this volume will be redistributed to open
up opportunities for woodlots community forests and first nations and the other half will be available for public auction licensees will
be compensated by the crown for the return of tenure and related infrastructure costs such as roads and bridges
          the effect of the timber takeback resulted in a reduction of approximately 24 million cubic metres to canfors existing allowable
annual cut on its replaceable tenures
          on october 28 2005 canfor signed an agreement with the province of british columbia in which canfor received 570 million in
compensation for the loss of tenures noted above and a 50 million payment against lost infrastructure and road construction costs a
loss of 88 million was recorded in 2005 on the tenures taken back

in 2003 canfor entered into an agreement with bc hydro to build an electrical cogeneration facility at the prince george pulp and paper
mill under the agreement bc hydro contributed 458 million of the project costs with canfor contributing the balance the agreement
was assigned to cplp effective july 1 2006 with incentive payments totaling 114 million outstanding the final incentive payment of
114 million was received august 9 2006 and transferred to canfor the total incentive payments of 458 million were accounted for as
a reduction of property plant and equipment transferred to cplp the project was completed in 2005 at a net cost to the pulp business of
696 million the agreement entails a 15 year commitment with bc hydro for power displacement at the cogeneration facility whereby
a proportionate repayment is required should the facility not generate the minimum of 390 gigawatt hours of electricity per year as
required under the agreement cplp has posted a letter of credit in the amount of 339 million as security
       as of august 10 2006 the cogeneration facility produced a total of 3905 gigawatt hours of electricity marking the fulfillment of
the first year of power production commitment for the period from august 11 2006 to december 31 2006 the cogeneration facility
produced a total of 1489 gigawatt hours of electricity or 85 of target with the completion of the second year at august 10 2007 if the
project were to produce less than 390 gigawatt hours of electricity in any year during the term of the agreement cplp will have until
the end of the succeeding year to make up the shortfall balance if a shortfall balance carried over from a preceding year has not been
made up by the end of the succeeding year cplp is required to compensate bc hydro for the shortfall balance by paying bc hydro an
amount determined by the shortfall balance divided by the annual target 390 gigawatt hours multiplied by 327 million being 115 of
the total incentive payments originally provided by bc hydro
       as of december 31 2006 cplp has no repayment obligation under the terms of the agreement
