that has a reasonable prospect of being economically extracted in the future but which is not yet classified as proved or probable ore reserves this
material is defined as a mineral resource under the jorc code 2012 estimates of such material are based largely on geological information with
only preliminary consideration of mining economic and other factors while in the judgement of the competent person there are realistic expectations
that all or part of the mineral resources will eventually become proved or probable ore reserves there is no guarantee that this will occur as the
result depends on further technical and economic studies and prevailing economic conditions in the future
the information in this statement that relates to mineral resources is based on information compiled by mr james pocoe and mr gerald clark who
are members of the australasian institute of mining and metallurgy mr pocoe and mr clark are independent geological consultants mr pocoe and
mr clark have experience which is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposits under consideration and to the activity which they have
undertaken to qualify as a competent person as defined in the 2012 edition of the australasian code for reporting of exploration results minerals

mine assets were fully depreciated or impaired in previous financial years
during 2014 the autonomous bougainville government passed the bougainville mining transitional arrangement act
2014 transitional act which was replaced by the bougainville mining act 2015 the act on 1st april 2015 this legislation
seeks to challenge the companys control of the mine assets and may reflect an expropriation of assets for the purpose
of the bougainville copper act
the act converted the special mining lease held by the company to an exploration licence el for a period of two years
from the date of the transitional act in july 2016 the company applied to extend the el the abg has acknowledged
receipt of the renewal application and the company has satisfied renewal obligations according to the act at year end the
abg had not been able to conclude the review
under the provisions of the act the el is deemed to be renewed and extended until and unless there is an official rejection
in july 2016 the abg issued a notice to show cause to the company due to the transfer of shares by rio tinto during the
initial two year period of the el the company responded to the show cause notice indicating the transfer was unrelated to
any actions of the company the directors believe the notice to show cause has been substantially resolved by a significant
portion of ownership being taken on by the abg as a result of the transfer of shares
bougainville copper limited while adhering to the requirements of the bougainville mining act 2015 also recognises
and maintains the tenements in accordance with the png national legislation and the bougainville copper agreement
the directors of the company continue to take all possible steps to protect and optimise tenure in bougainville

from the date of the transitional act in july 2016 the company applied to extend the el the abg has acknowledged
receipt of the renewal application and the company has satisfied renewal obligations according to the act at year end the
abg had not been able to conclude the review
under the provisions of the act the el is deemed to be renewed and extended until and unless there is an official rejection

initial two year period of the el the company responded to the show cause notice indicating the transfer was unrelated to
any actions of the company the directors believe the notice to show cause has been substantially resolved by a significant
portion of ownership being taken on by the abg as a result of the transfer of shares

with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear
on our independence and where applicable related safeguards
from the matters communicated with those charged with governance we determine
those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements
for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters we describe these
matters in our auditors report unless law or regulations preclude public disclosure
about the matter or when in extremely rare circumstances we determine that a
matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of
such communication

report on other legal and regulatory requirements
the companies act 1997 requires that in carrying out our audit we consider and report
on the following matters we confirm in relation to our audit of the financial statements
for the year ended 31 december 2016
 with the exception of the matter described in the basis for qualified opinion section
  we have obtained all the information and explanations that we have required
 in our opinion proper accounting records have been kept by the company as far as
  appears from an examination of those records

who we report to
this report is made solely to the companys shareholders as a body in accordance
with the companies act 1997 our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the companys shareholders those matters which we are required to state to
them in an auditors report and for no other purpose we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the companys shareholders as
a body for our audit work for this report or for the opinions we have formed

not included in the above table are the benefits received by the providers of goods and services to bougainville copper
limited a company survey in 1989 revealed that there were approximately 200 bougainville based business enterprises
dependent largely upon bougainville copper limiteds operation these enterprises employed in excess of 4000 people
prior to the suspension of mining operations

the png economy has a delayed impact
