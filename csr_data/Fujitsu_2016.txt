through digital transformation we are cocreating a humancentric society
that is safer more sustainable and more prosperous

 essence of csr is adapting management practices based on the premise of sustainability


the essence of corporate social responsibility csr i believe is listening to the voices of

stakeholders and flexibly adapting management practices based on the premise of

sustainability in society and business

            there are however some elements we should not change these include

fujitsus promise to walk shoulder to shoulder with customers earn their trust and use

technology to cocreate a humancentric society that is safer more prosperous and more

sustainable i firmly believe that fujitsus technology makes people happier

            at present i feel that there are two transformations to which we must respond

            the first transformation is global society there are many people in the world

who lack access to safe food and water and live with inadequate educational and medical

services a host of problems are worsening due to urbanization and aging societies these

problems however cannot be solved by intensifying our current measures to address them

in striving to achieve the un sustainable development goals sdgs  fujitsu believes that

its corporate mission is to transform society through the power of technology

            the second transformation to respond to is digital society ict creates new value through digital transformation that

spreads to the many corners of business and society progress of the internet of things artificial intelligence and other endeavors

makes problem solving and collaboration between humans and machines possible at the same time new areas of concern involving

data security privacy and decrease of employment call for stronger responses i believe that it is important for fujitsu in line with our

responsibility as a global ict company to reduce any negative impacts of our business activities on society while scaling up our

businesses that benefit society

            as part of our worldwide corporate responsibility fujitsu supports and is a signatory to the un global compacts 10

principles in the areas of human rights labor the environment and anticorruption going forward we will devote ourselves to

respecting and upholding these principles and to the review and improvement of socially responsible activities with zero tolerance for

exceptions we will carry out these social responsibilities with no exceptions and continuously review and improve our activities as for

compliance we have implemented the global compliance program throughout the fujitsu group in order to firmly establish a

corporate culture where each and every fujitsu employee around the world has zero tolerance for any wrongdoing

            moreover through digital transformation we would like to work with our partners to create a humancentric intelligent

society that is safer more sustainable and more prosperous

 implementing csr activities utilizing iso 26000


  strengthening global csr management in the fujitsu group
in order to engage in csr activities integrated with management since fy 2012 the fujitsu group along with the related departments
below have conducted csr surveys based on iso 26000 the international standard for social responsibility aimed at group companies in
japan and overseas
             the purpose of this monitoring is to ensure that our two initiatives of risk mitigation and value creation are taken up at all
group companies first in terms of risk mitigation we will establish prevention and correction processes due diligence to minimize the
effects of latent human rights and labor practice risks including in our supply chain which may negatively impact our corporate value
and in terms of value creation we contribute to solving issues facing regional societies while maximally leveraging group resources and
promoting activities conducive to generating value in the entire group

executive officers to the broadest extent that is permitted by law and the articles of incorporation of the company and is considered to

been strengthened by actively appointing external directors with high independence and diverse perspective

overview of the audit  supervisory board
the company has an audit  supervisory board that performs the auditing and oversight functions the auditing and oversight functions
are carried out by audit  supervisory board members who review the board of directors as well as business execution functions and
attend important meetings including meetings of the board of directors
            the audit  supervisory board has five members comprising two fulltime audit  supervisory board members and three
external audit  supervisory board members


executive nomination committee and compensation committee
the company has established the executive nomination committee and the compensation committee as advisory bodies for its board of
directors to ensure the transparency and objectivity of its process for nominating directors and audit  supervisory board members and
its process for determining executive compensation as well as to ensure the fairness of the method and level of executive compensation
            the executive nomination committee deliberates about candidates for director and audit  supervisory board member
positions in accordance with the framework of corporate governance structure and the procedures and policy of directors and auditors
nomination stipulated in the companys corporate governance policy and provides its recommendations to the board of directors in
addition the compensation committee provides its recommendations about the level of base compensation and the method for
calculating performancebased compensation to the board of directors in accordance with the procedures and policy of determining
directors and auditors compensation stipulated in the companys corporate governance policy


            according to the corporate governance policy each committee is composed of a majority of nonexecutive directors and
auditors with at least one independent director in fiscal 2015 each committee consists of three nonexecutive directors and auditors
including one independent director and one executive director both committees members in fiscal 2015 are as follows
       chairman of both committees tatsuzumi furukawa
       members of both committees megumi yamamuro jun yokota and masami yamamoto


            the fy 2015 term of the above committee members ended at the close of the regular annual shareholders meeting on june
27 2016 appointment of members of the committees for fiscal 2016 is scheduled for july 2016


independent directors  auditors council
in response to the requirements of japans corporate governance code which facilitates the activities of independent directors and
auditors and in order to invigorate discussions on the medium to longterm direction of the company at its board of directors meetings
the company believes it essential to establish a system which enables independent directors and auditors who maintain a certain
degree of separation from the execution of business activities to consistently gain a deeper understanding of the companys business
based on this recognition the company established the independent directors and auditors council in fiscal 2015 in the independent
directors and auditors council members discuss on the medium to longterm direction of the company and share information and
exchange viewpoints so that they can each formulate their own opinions


reasons for adoption of current corporate governance system
we believe that both direct oversight to business execution by the nonexecutive directors and the oversight by audit  supervisory
board members that stays distant from the decision making and operation of business execution should work jointly to ensure highly
effective oversight performance the company adopts the company with audit  supervisory board system that establishes the audit 
supervisory board which is composed of the audit  supervisory board members appointed as an independent agent
            the board of directors comprises same number or more nonexecutive directors as executive directors to ensure its capacity
to correct faulty insufficient or excessive business executions while external directors should be the core of nonexecutive directors on
account of their high independence at least one nonexecutive director is appointed from within the company to complement the
external directors knowledge in the business fields and the corporate culture of the company so that the efficiency of oversight

trend and measures concerning the raising of retirement age in china

under the recognition of chinas economic shift from highspeed growth to the socalled new normal of more moderate growth the
chinese government has ramped up policies aiming at stable economic growth and qualitative improvements in concert with these
policies the laws and the environment surrounding workers have been changing and companies have been required to respond
appropriately as an example on october 29 2015 at the 5th plenary session of the 18th central committee of the communist party of
china a draft of chinas 13th fiveyear plan for 2016 to 2020 was announced the draft states that china will announce policies for the
stepwise increase in the retirement age which at present is age 60 for men and age 50 for women in principle the policies are
scheduled for announcement in 2017
              our group companies in china have interorganizational working groups with input from experts to exchange information
and hold discussions on the increase in the retirement age and to examine how to address the issue in china where the flow of human
resources in labor markets is dynamic a rise in the retirement age will facilitate the securing of human resources as we will be able to
continue the employment of talented employees we also have expectations for the change in terms of guidance and education provided
to younger employees by those employees with abundant skills and experience

employee can work in confidence and remain active through means such as the implementation of new retirement benefit plans and
postretirement reemployment plans

examples of field innovation mitsubishi heavy industries ltd
promoting process reform in shipping and receiving work procedures for intelligent transport system its equipment and contributing to
the invigoration of work improvement activities in the company


issues
arrival of equipment was concentrated on certain days which placed a burden on receiving work
frequent changes and additions to shipping equipment often required unplanned responses
the reception period of equipment and the schedules for inspection and fieldwork were independently planned
effects
improved the completion rate of checkin from the date of arrival to the following day from 73 to 95
reduced the frequency of changes in shipping requests by listing the equipment configuration information
strengthened the system to check the entire process from reception to inspection and fieldwork


the ict solution headquarters of mitsubishi heavy industries introduced field innovation with the aim of improving and reforming the
shipping and shipment receipt work of the manufacturing section which is involved in the manufacture of intelligent transport system
its equipment


numerous burdens were faced in shipping and receiving work procedures on the shipping site to reform the manufacturing section
the shipping site of the ict solution headquarters of mitsubishi heavy industries receives incoming materials manages inventory and
performs product shipping situated between other work processes it is easily affected by circumstances on the ordering side and the
installation side and discrepancies can appear in the communication of information concerning what products in what configuration and
number are to be shipped where

visualization of all work processes including upstream and downstream processes
following interviews with relevant parties on the shipping site investigation through onsite observation and data analysis field
innovators clearly showed that receipt of shipments was concentrated on specific days that updates to shipment request forms by onsite
agents were frequent and that longterm stagnant inventory existed


setting three themes for measures
based on these facts the team carried out intensive discussions aimed at improvements members engaged in solutions narrowed down
to three themes engage checking functions at the time of installation processes and receipt of equipment shipments make equipment
configuration easier to understand during onsite installation and make the schedule for receipt of shipments visible and coordinate
receipt of shipment dates in advance


a deeprooted structure for improvement
through these activities members awareness of the issue changed considerably by learning of problems outside of their direct work
they were able to share issues with other members and organize problems with an aim toward effecting improvements accordingly all
members not only designated persons in charge were able to work together toward shared issues
              the ict solutions headquarters is already looking ahead to enacting improvements and reforms with its customers and its
procurement partners

  fostering experts who support product safety
at fujitsu as part of efforts to ensure product safety in fy 2003 we established our own certification program to train product safety
experts under a system in which people who complete the program are certified by the product safety management team in corporate
quality management unit 213 people were registered at the end of fy 2015
             product safety experts verify the safety of products at the design review stage each process from the initial stage of
development to the decision to ship under this structure when a product cannot be confirmed as safe it does not receive final approval
to ship in addition to verifying conformity to safety requirements in japan and overseas as well as to fujitsus own standards the experts
perform checks from the perspective of preventing recurrence of problems that happened with
other products in the past furthermore product safety experts take followup training twice a
year and an annual qualification renewal test to maintain and improve their skills
             also when products are designed risks must be assessed from the viewpoint of the
user including latent risks intrinsic to a product and risks from the way a product is used
accordingly in fy 2010 fujitsu established internal standards for the conduct of product safety
risk assessments and began training product safety risk assessors as of the end of fy 2015 we
have 160 registered product safety risk assessors
                                                                                                                 product safety experts in training

  promoting information security measures
based on the cybersecurity management guidelines issued in december 2015 by japans ministry of economy trade and industry and the
informationtechnology promotion agency fujitsu group along with its suppliers has set the goal of eliminating information security incidents
and is continuously implementing measures to prevent such incidents or recurrences thereof these measures include education enlightenment
auditing and information sharing
             in recent years there has been a significant increase in commercial use of external services such as cloud computing and
social network services there has also been a rapid increase in opportunities to use smart devices such as smartphones and tablet pcs it
is necessary to prevent not only emails sent by mistake theft and the loss of pcs and smart devices but also new kinds of risks involving
information leaks such as internal crimes and cyber terrorism as such when fujitsu consigns suppliers fujitsu sets the same standards
for both domestic and overseas entrusted suppliers regarding the information security management and the handling of personal
information promoting education and awareness
             if any serious problem in information security occurs at a supplier or if a supplier shows no improvement in its security
management we reconsider the business relationship with the supplier and may discontinue placing new orders
             moreover we have been working to implement information security measures equivalent to those used in our domestic
japanese activities for an increasing number of offshore development projects with overseas partners

  supply chain bcm and procurement compliance


  supply chain bcm
to stably supply products and services in the event of major disasters or other unexpected contingencies fujitsu has made a continuous
commitment to strengthening the bcm capabilities of our suppliers since fy 2007 this commitment is based on the belief that strengthening
bcm capabilities throughout the entire supply chain is essential
             each year fujitsu conducts a questionnaire survey of its suppliers on how they address bcm in fy 2015 we surveyed roughly 860
suppliers including some group companies at about 2260 sites by questionnaire we analyzed the results from around 2190 sites as of
september 30 and provided feedback to our suppliers
             for this questionnaire survey fujitsu formulated its own original content but in fiscal 2013 an investigation subcommittee was
established under the umbrella of the japan electronics and information technology industries association jeita materials committee
assembled products manufacturers and component manufacturers participated in planning and measures to standardize as an industry got
underway efforts moved forward to formulate a questionnaire survey covering risk management items from a procurement standpoint
focused on supply responsibility needed of suppliers and it was made available to the public by the jeita materials committee in september
2014fujitsu also proactively participated in the planning of these subcommittee activities and began utilizing it from fy2014 questionnaire
survey
             in addition fujitsu conducts annual surveys on bcm initiatives with 240 major solutionsrelated suppliers feedback is analyzed
and implemented as necessary


  procurement compliance to all suppliers
fujitsu group launched a confidential communication channel called the compliance line available to all suppliers in august 2009 the
compliance line is to receive reports from suppliers on any matters of potential or actual noncompliance action with regard to our
purchasing activities through the channels we have set up both internally and externally we verify and investigate the facts of every
report and respond quickly
             in its rule on internal reporting fujitsu forbids detrimental treatment toward its own personnel or the personnel of suppliers
who have made reports
             in addition we added to agreements with suppliers provisions on the elimination of antisocial forces and other such
groups for the purpose of preventing damage by antisocial forces and avoiding any encouragement of their activities fujitsu group
will have no relationship whatsoever with antisocial forces including through suppliers

with our shareholders and investors

 our basic stance


based on the statement we strive to continuously increase our corporate value in the corporate values of the fujitsu way in order to
raise corporate value and meet the expectations of shareholders and investors we aim to achieve longterm sustainable expansion of
profit and pursue strategic business expansion and focused management while maintaining a sound financial standing
               we also provide timely and accurate disclosure of our corporate activities and financial information improving management
transparency so that shareholders and investors can better understand how well we perform in increasing corporate value



 basic policy on information disclosure


fujitsu emphasizes fairness and continuity in disclosure of information in accordance with the financial instruments and exchange act
and other laws and regulations as well as the rules of the exchanges on which its shares are listed
               moreover our policy is to be proactive in disclosing any information that we judge to be effective for helping shareholders
investors and other stakeholders to deepen their understanding of fujitsu even if such disclosure is not required by laws regulations or
other rules



 policy on dividends and dividends forecast


article 40 of fujitsu limiteds articles of incorporation grants the board of directors the authority to distribute retained earnings as part of
fujitsus basic policy on the exercise of this authority a portion of retained earnings is paid to shareholders to provide a stable return and
a portion is retained by the company to strengthen its financial base and support new business development opportunities that will result
in improved longterm performance in addition while taking into consideration its level of profit when a sufficient volume of internal
reserves is secured including through the acquisition of its own shares fujitsu aims to more proactively distribute profits to shareholders
               our consolidated results in fy2015 yielded a decline in profits comparing to the previous fiscal year due to some factors
including the expenses to accelerate innovative business restructuring however we have maintained a certain level of profitability and
will distribute 4 yen per share as planned for the fy2015 yearend dividend looking ahead to consolidated results for fy2016 we are
unable to project a significant increase in profits due to ongoing initiatives for innovative changes in our business models accordingly we
plan an interim dividend and a yearend dividend of 4 yen per share each in fy2016 as in fy2015
