our
approach
shell works to help meet the worlds
growing demand for energy in a
responsible way this means
operating safely reducing our
impact on the environment and
sharing beneﬁts with the communities
who are our neighbours we have
global standards in place and
continually learn from our
experiences to improve the way we
operate this section outlines how
sustainability underpins our
operations including how we work
with communities our commitment
to safe operations and how we
manage environmental impacts

sustainable development in shell
shell works with governments partners and communities to help meet the worlds growing
energy demand in a more sustainable way this makes good business sense and helps to
build trust with the communities around us

     in line with eiti goals to achieve greater transparency we are monitoring implementation of us and

    they exist where there is no locally regulated method the data are calculated using the 2009 api compendium which is the recognised industry standard under the ghg protocol corporate accounting and
    reporting standard there are inherent limitations to the accuracy of such data oil and gas industry guidelines ipiecaapiogp indicate that a number of sources of uncertainty can contribute to the overall

about our data
there are inherent limitations to the accuracy of
environmental and social data we recognise that
our environmental and social data will be affected
by these limitations and continue to improve the
integrity of our data by strengthening our
internal controls

all such nonﬁnancial data in this report are
reported on a 100 basis for companies and
joint ventures where we are the operator
environmental data are for our direct emissions
unless otherwise stated we report in this way in
line with industry practice because these are the
data we can directly manage and affect through
operational improvements

operations acquired or divested during the year
are included only for the period of our ownership
other data are collected from external sources
staff surveys and other internal sources as indicated

we only include data in this report that have been
conﬁrmed by the end of march 2014 if incidents
are reclassiﬁed or conﬁrmed or if signiﬁcant data
changes occur after preparation of this report they
will be updated in the following years publication
certain data as marked in the social data table
come from an internal survey completed by the
senior shell representative in each country
the accuracy of environmental and social data
may be lower than that of data obtained through
our ﬁnancial systems

data provided are subject to internal controls
lloyds register quality assurance ltd has provided
limited assurance of our direct and indirect
greenhouse gas ghg emissions data for 2013
limited assurance means nothing has come to the
auditors attention that would indicate that the data
are not correct for ghg emissions we provide
