facing the severe fastpaced environment yang ming concluded the longterm lease
of ﬁfteen 14000 teu containerships in 2013 due to a proper timing for the charter
deal we have achieved remarkable competitiveness in operating cost and energy
utilization among peers in the era of mega ships in addition yang ming continues to
increase income by grasping every possibility of restoring freight rates advancing the
turnaround of containers and promoting interportcargo as for the costcutting part
implementing fuelsaving projects securing the berth priority and increasing terminal
operation efﬁciency to save berth time as well as bunker are the measures we have
taken

in order to cope with the competition yang ming has kept its own flexibility while
cooperating with partners in alliance besides existing main eastwest long haul
services we evaluate and grasp every opportunity to venture upon emerging
markets all the effort we make is to meet customers demand with fullscale port
coverage in global service network and to fully utilize our tonnage and capacity for

  engines of man bw me type and wartsila rtflex type with new
  commonrail electronic fuel injection system for vessels main propulsion alpha
  cylinder oil lubricator device and high efﬁciency fuel injection valve slide valve in
  diesel engine

d shaft generator
  we use shaft generator noted for energysaving and efficiency it can provide
  clean electricity while the vessel is sailing in the ocean moreover it will greatly
  reduce oil consumption and exhaust emission

e propeller boss cap fins pbcf
  propeller boss cap fins pbcf have been applied to our container vessels like
  ym masculinity and ym unicorn pbcf can cut down the strong vortex
  generated by the propeller it can relatively increase propellers efﬁciency decrease
  fuel consumption and thus reduce the vessels co2 sox and nox emissions

f esbow
  esbow can reduce wave resistance caused by vessel navigating and save fuel
  oil



                                                                                            23

     g esrudder
       yang ming e type vessel have esrudder which can reduce hub vortex caused
       by propeller rotation increase propulsion efﬁciency  save fuel oil and thus reduce
       the co2 sox and nox emissions

                                                 reducing the fuel consumption is the
                                                 best way to achieve energy conservation
                                                 and carbon reduction green vessels
                                                 are designed to minimize the fuel
                                                 consumption

take domestic road transportation for example energy consumption of heavy
transport vehicles accounts for 30 of the cost of road transport in order to reduce
fuel consumption yang mings affiliated company jing ming educated the truck
driver to throttle down  the speed limitation is 85 km on highway no warm up at idle
speed and to use energy saving products like ecotires wind guide plate together
with well management of truck ﬂeet and introduction of energysaving technology it
is estimated this can save about 189 kiloliters in fuel reduce co2 emission up to 510
tons equal to the amount reduced by the plants of 13 daan forest parks the largest
