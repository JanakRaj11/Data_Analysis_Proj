apaches driving efforts to promote natural gas as a transportation fuel took a turn
toward southeast texas with the opening of the first cng station between houston
and corpus christi

the swamps and marshes of coastal louisiana are among the nations most fragile
wetlands louisiana has lost up to 40 square miles of marsh per year for several            13 9900000
decades caused by the natural processes of subsidence saltwater intrusion and
shoreline erosion and human activities such as dredging for canals                             238
if the current rate of loss is not slowed by the year 2040 an additional 800000 acres
of wetlands could disappear                                                                n total field co2 emissions

wetlands act as a storm buffer against hurricanes and storms and as flood control
devices by holding excess floodwaters during heavy rainfall wetlands replenish
aquifers and purify water by filtering out pollutants and absorbing nutrients
reducing the loss of coastal wetlands in louisiana is proving to be difficult and costly
for apache it means working hard to find environmentally sound solutions to help save
the swamps and marshes in the areas where the company operates along the coast
restoring coastal marsh
a longawaited project to restore coastal marsh along liners canal in terrebonne
parish has been completed thanks to apache and ducks unlimited
the liners canal project benefits hundreds of acres of fresh and intermediate marsh
by increasing freshwater flow into an area severely threatened by saltwater intrusion
a multibay water control structure was built to increase threefold the freshwater
flow through the canal the water control structure also prevents saltwater from
reaching freshwater marshes upstream
the project is helping waterfowl wildlife and fisheries habitats providing storm
protection and improving water quality it also boosts recreational activities like
bird watching and boating as well as fishing and hunting

gators aid
for years apache has been helping alligators thrive in the coastal marshes of
louisiana by supporting a sustainable harvest that has helped bring the reptiles
back from the brink of extinction
under a state wildlife management program apache contracts with licensed alligator
farmers who gather alligator eggs on company marshland the farmers incubate the
eggs and grow the hatchlings to about 4 feet in length and then harvest the skins about
12 percent of the hatchlings are returned to the marsh areas where they were collected
apache applies for wild alligator harvest tags from the state and distributes them to
its alligator hunters allowing them to take a set number of the reptiles from its land
the alligator hunters typically harvest about 1700 wild alligators annually apache

apache worked closely with elk city officials in implementing several neighborhood

starters apache set up the drill rig to be powered by electricity instead of diesel
generators reducing carbon emissions and noise levels
the company also built 32foot sound walls on three sides of the rig to further reduce

with this system apache does not have to acquire freshwater from a municipal
system a farmer or a commercial source and it doesnt have to pay to dispose of
produced water in deep injection wells
in the stiles ranch area in the companys central region the recycling system
has capacity to store 240000 barrels of produced water  enough for almost three
