      8070346 these were offset by net cash inflows from financing activities of 4853152 2010 380114 for the year ended 30
      june 2011 and as at that date had a working capital surplus of 2858619 2010 2135204
      the consolidated entitys ability to continue as a going concern and pay its debts as and when they fall due is dependent on the
      following
          active management of the current level of discretionary expenditure in line with the funds available to the consolidated
           entity and
          the ability to raise additional funding through either debt facilities or capital raising if required
      based on the existing cash resources the ability to reduce operational administration and exploration expenditure and the ability

      accompanying a shareholding of more than onehalf of the voting rights the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are
      currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the group controls another entity
      subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group they are deconsolidated from the
      date that control ceases

      accounting policies the effects of all intercompany transactions balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities
      in the group are eliminated in full

d   exploration expenses
      exploration and evaluation costs represent intangible assets exploration and evaluation costs including costs incurred as a result
      of the introduction agreement referred to in note 26 but excluding other acquisition costs are expensed as incurred acquisition
      costs related to an area of interest are capitalised and carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through
      the successful development of the area or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage which permits reasonable
      assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in or in relation to the
      areas of interest are continuing
      accumulated acquisition costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full against profit and loss account in the year in
      which the decision to abandon the area is made
      costs of site restoration are provided over the life of the facility from when exploration commences and are included in the costs
      of that stage site restoration costs include the dismantling and removal of mining plant equipment and building structures waste
      removal and rehabilitation of the site in accordance with clauses of the mining permits such costs have been determined using
      estimates of future costs current legal requirements and technology on an undiscounted basis
      any changes in the estimates for the costs are accounted on a prospective basis in determining the costs of site restoration there
      is uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of the restoration due to community expectations and future legislation accordingly
      the costs have been determined on the basis that the restoration will be completed
e   cash and cash equivalents
      cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand deposits held at call with financial institutions other shortterm highly liquid
      investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are
      subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value
f   plant and equipment
      plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis so as to write
      off the net cost of each asset during their expected useful life of 3 to 5 years

      in excess of the recoverable amount from assets
g   investments and other financial assets
      classification
      the company classifies its investments in the following categories financial assets at fair value through profit and loss loans and
      receivables heldtomaturity investments and availableforsale financial assets the classification depends on the purpose for
      which the investments were acquired management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and in the
      case of assets classified as heldtomaturity reevaluates this designation at each reporting date
      financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
      financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are financial assets held for trading a financial asset is classified in this
      category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term assets in this category are classified as current assets
      loans and receivables

      current assets
      availableforsale financial assets
      availableforsale financial assets principally comprising marketable equity securities are nonderivatives that are either designated
      in this category or not classified in any of the other categories they are included in noncurrent assets unless management
      intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of 30 june 2011
      recognition and derecognition
      regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date  the date on which the company commits to
      purchase or sell the asset investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried
      at fair value through profit or loss financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and
      transaction costs are expensed to the income statement financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows
      from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the company has transferred substantially all the risks and
      rewards of ownership
      when securities are classified as availableforsale are sold the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are
      included in the income statement as gains and losses from investment securities
      subsequent measurement
      loans and receivables and heldtomaturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method
      availableforsale financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value gains or losses arising
      from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are presented in the income
      statement within other income or other expenses in the period in which they arise dividend income from financial assets at
      fair value through profit and loss is recognised in the income statement as part of income from continuing operations when the
      companys right to receive payment is established
      fair value
      the fair values of quoted investments are based on last trade prices if the market for financial assets is not active and for unlisted
      securities the company establishes fair value by using valuation techniques
      impairment
      the company assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired in the case
      of equity securities classified as availableforsale a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a security below its cost is
      considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired if any such evidence exists for availableforsale financial assets the
      cumulative loss  measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value less any impairment loss on
      that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss  is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement
h   provisions and employee benefits
      provisions and employee benefits
      provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation either legal or constructive as a result of a past event it is
      probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
      can be made of the amount of the obligation
      provisions are measured at the present value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present
      obligation at 30 june 2011 using a discounted cash flow methodology the risks specific to the provision are factored into the
      cash flows and as such a riskfree government bond rate relative to the expected life of the provision is used as a discount rate
      the increase in the provision resulting from the passage of time is recognised in finance costs




                                                                                                                                                       25

      employee leave benefits
      liabilities for wages and salaries including nonmonetary benefits annual leave and accumulating sick leave expected to be
      settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in respect of employees services up to the reporting date they
      are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled expenses for nonaccumulating sick leave are
      recognised when the leave is taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable
i   share based payments
      the company provides benefits to directors employees consultants and other advisors of the company in the form of share
      based payments whereby the directors employees consultants and other advisors render services in exchange for shares or
      rights over shares equitysettled transactions
      the cost of these equitysettled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at
      which they are granted the fair value is determined by an external valuer using a blackscholes model
      in valuing equitysettled transactions no account is taken of any performance conditions other than conditions linked to the
      market price of the shares of the company if applicable
      the cost of equitysettled transactions is recognised together with a corresponding increase in equity over the period in which the
      performance andor service conditions are fulfilled ending on the date on which the relevant recipient becomes fully entitled to the
      award the vesting period
      the cumulative expense recognised for equitysettled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects
      i the extent to which the vesting period has expired and
      ii the companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest
      no adjustment is made for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included
      in the determination of fair value at grant date the income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in
      cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period
      no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is only conditional upon a
      market condition
      if the terms of an equitysettled award are modified as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been
      modified in addition an expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the sharebased payment
      arrangement or is otherwise beneficial to the recipient as measured at the date of modification
      if an equitysettled award is cancelled it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet
      recognised for the award is recognised immediately however if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and
      designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted the cancelled and new award are treated as if they were a
      modification of the original award as described in the previous paragraph
j   earnings per share
      basic earnings per share is determined by dividing the profit loss after income tax attributable to equity holders of the company
      by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year
k   fair value estimation
      the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure
      purposes
      the fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets such as shares in listed companies is based on quoted market
      prices at 30 june 2011
      the nominal value less any estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their
      fair value




m arenica energ y ann u al report 2 0 1 1

l   impairment of assets
      at each reporting date the consolidated entity reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is
      any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss if any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the
      asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any
m payables
      trade payables and other accounts payable are recognised when the consolidated entity becomes obliged to make future
      payments resulting from the purchase of goods and services
n   revenue recognition
      interest income is recognised on a time proportionate basis that takes into account the effective yield on the financial assets
o   foreign currency
      transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction monetary assets
      and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 30 june 2011 are translated to australian dollars at the foreign exchange rate
      ruling at that date foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement nonmonetary
      assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at
      the date of the transaction nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are
      translated to australian dollars at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined
p   segment reporting
      the group uses an management approach under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for
      internal reporting purposes operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the
      chief operating decision maker the chief operating decision maker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing
      performance of the operating segments has been identified as the board of directors
q   income tax
      the income tax expense or revenue for the year is the tax payable on the current years taxable income based on the notional
      income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between tax bases
      of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements and to unused tax losses
      a deferred tax asset for unused tax losses is recognised only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise
      losses
      deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and
      when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority current tax assets and liabilities are offset where the entity
      has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liability
      simultaneously


3    significant accounting judgements estimates and assumptions
      the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that affect
      the reported amounts in the financial statements management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to
      assets liabilities contingent liabilities revenue and expenses management bases its judgements and estimates on historical
      experience and on other various factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis
      of the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these
      estimates under different assumptions and conditions
      management has identified the following critical accounting policies for which significant judgements estimates and assumptions
      are made actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions and may materially affect
      financial results or the financial position reported in future periods
      further details of the nature of these assumptions and conditions may be found in the relevant notes to the financial statements




                                                                                                                                                  27

     determination of mineral resources
     the determination of mineral resources impacts the accounting for asset carrying values the group estimates its mineral
     resources in accordance with the australian code for reporting of exploration results mineral resources and ore reserves 2004
     the jorc code the information on mineral resources was prepared by or under the supervision of competent persons as
     defined in the jorc code the amounts presented are based on the mineral resources determined under the jorc code
     there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral resources and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation
     may change significantly when new information becomes available
     changes in the forecast prices of commodities exchange rates production costs or recovery rates may change the economic
     status of reserves and may ultimately result in reserves being restated
     significant accounting estimates and assumptions
     share based payment transactions
     the group measures the cost of equitysettled share based payment transactions with employees by reference to the fair value
     of the equity instruments at the grant date the fair value is determined by using a recognised option valuation model with the
     assumptions detailed in note 24 the accounting estimates and assumptions relating to equitysettled share based payments
     would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period but may impact
     expenses and equity

   liquidity risk
   liquidity risk is the risk that the consolidated entity will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due the
   consolidated entitys approach to managing liquidity is to ensure as far as possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to
   meet its liabilities when due under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage
   to the consolidated entitys reputation
   the consolidated entity manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves from funds raised in the market and by
   continuously monitoring forecast and actual flows the consolidated entity does not have any external borrowings

   fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
   the company does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or through equity
   therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss or equity
   cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
   a change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by
   the amounts shown below this analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant the analysis is performed on the same
   basis for 2010
