  2        summary of significant accounting policies

  21      basis of preparation

  the financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with the established korean international
  financial reporting standards kifrs adopting international financial reporting standards ifrs as issued
  by the international accounting standards board iasb in accordance with item 1 of the 1st clause of article 13 of
  external audit law

  the financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain items such as financial
  instruments which are mentioned separately in the following accounting principles the financial statements
  are presented in korean won krw and all values are rounded off to the nearest million 000000 except when
  otherwise indicated

  the group maintains its official accounting records in korean won and prepares statutory financial statements
  in the korean language in conformity with kifrs in the event of any differences in interpreting the financial
  statements or the independent auditors report thereon the korean version which is used for regulatory reporting
  purposes shall prevail



  22      basis of consolidation

  the consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the group and its subsidiaries as
  of december 31 2015 control is achieved when the group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from                           105
  its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee
  specifically the group controls an investee if and only if the group has
   power over the investee ie existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the

     investee
   exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee

   the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns



  when the group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee the group considers all relevant
  facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee including
   the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee

   rights arising from other contractual arrangements

   the groups voting rights and potential voting rights



  the group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are
  changes to one or more of the three elements of control consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the group obtains
  control over the subsidiary and ceases when it loses control of the subsidiary assets liabilities income and expenses
  of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income from
  the date that the group gains control until the date that it ceases to control the subsidiary

  profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income oci are attributed to the equity holders of the parent
  of the group and to the noncontrolling interests even if the results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit
  balance when necessary adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align their accounting
  policies with the groups accounting policies all intragroup assets and liabilities equity income expenses and cash
  flows relating to transactions between members of the group are eliminated in full on consolidation

  a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without a loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction




                                                                                 songwon annual financial  sustainability report 2015

      23       convenience translation into united states dollar amounts

      the company operates primarily in korean won and its official accounting records are maintained in korean won
      the us dollar amounts provided in the financial statements represent supplementary information solely for the
      convenience of the reader all won amounts are expressed in us dollars at the rate of krw 117744 to usd 1 the

      accounting principles and should not be construed as a representation that the won amounts shown could be
      readily converted realized or settled in us dollars at this or at any other rate



          business combinations and goodwill
      24	

      business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method the cost of an acquisition is measured
      as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any
      noncontrolling interest in the acquiree for each business combination the acquirer measures the noncontrolling
      interest in the acquiree  either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets
      acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses

      in business combinations achieved in stages any previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to
      its acquisition date fair value

      any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date
      subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will
      be recognized in profit or loss
106
      goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the
      amount recognized for noncontrolling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
      if this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is
      recognized in profit or loss

      after initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses for the purpose of
      impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of
      the groups cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the combination irrespective of whether other
      assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units



      25       interest in joint arrangements

      joint ventures
      a joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have
      rights to the net assets of the joint venture joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an
      arrangement which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the
      parties sharing control the considerations made in determining joint control are similar to those necessary to
      determine control over subsidiaries

      the groups investments in its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method under the equity method the
      investment in a joint venture and is initially recognized at cost the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to
      recognize changes in the groups share of net assets of the joint venture since the acquisition date

                                                  5 financial statements 6 final overview




  the statement of profit or loss reflects the groups share of the results of operations of the joint venture
  any change in oci of those investees is presented as part of the groups oci in addition when there has been
  a change recognized directly in the equity of a joint venture the group recognizes its share of any changes when
  applicable in the statement of changes in equity unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between
  the group and the joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the joint venture

  the aggregate of the groups share of profit or loss in a joint venture is shown on the face of the statement of
  profit or loss outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and noncontrolling interests in the
  subsidiaries of the joint venture

  the financial statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the group when
  necessary adjustments are made to align the accounting policies with those of the group

  at each reporting date the group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the joint
  venture is impaired if there is such evidence the group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference
  between the recoverable amount of the joint venture and its carrying value it then recognizes the loss as share of
  profit of a joint venture in the statement of profit

  upon loss of significant influence over the joint venture the group measures and recognizes any retained
  investment at its fair value any difference between the carrying amount of the joint venture  upon loss of
  significant influence or joint control  and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is
  recognized in profit or loss

  joint operations
  a joint operation is defined as an arrangement in which the parties with joint control have rights to the assets                      107
  and obligations for the liabilities relating to that arrangement in respect of its interest in a joint operation a joint
  operator must recognize all of its assets liabilities revenues and expenses including its relative share of jointly
  controlled assets liabilities revenue and expenses

  the considerations made in determining joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over
  subsidiaries



  26      foreign currency translation

  the financial statements are presented in korean won which is the parent companys functional currency
  each entity in the group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of
  each entity are measured using that functional currency

  transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the group companies at their respective functional
  currency rates prevailing at the date of the transaction monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
  currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date
  nonmonetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange
  rates at the dates of the initial transactions nonmonetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are
  translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined

  the assets including goodwill and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is other than
  the korean won are translated using the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period while the statements of
  income are translated using average exchange rates during the period differences arising from such translations
  are recognized within equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign
  subsidiary is recognized




                                                                                songwon annual financial  sustainability report 2015

      27       property plant and equipment

      property plant and equipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
      losses such costs include the cost of replacing part of the property plant and equipment and borrowing costs
      for longterm construction projects if the recognition criteria are met other repair and maintenance costs are
      recognized in the income statement as incurred if the costs of certain components of an item of property plant and
      equipment are significant in relation to the total cost of the item they are accounted for and depreciated separately

      depreciation expense is recognized using the straightline method the following useful lives are assumed


      land                     no depreciation
      buildings                18 to 54 years
      structures               6 to 39 years
      machinery                10 to 20 years
      other                    1 to 10 years

      residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and if expectations differ from previous estimates
      adjusted accordingly

      the gain or loss arising from derecognition of a property plant or equipment shall be determined as the difference
      between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset it shall be recognized in the income
      statement when the asset is derecognized



108   28       intangible assets

      intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost the cost of intangible assets
      acquired in a business combination is its fair value as at the date of acquisition following initial recognition
      intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses

      intangible assets with useful finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment
      whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired the amortization period and the
      amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at the least at the end of each
      reporting period changes in the expected useful life or the expected consumption pattern of future economic
      benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method as appropriate
      and are treated as changes in accounting estimates the amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives
      is recognized in the income statement under cost of sales and selling and administration costs in the expense
      category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets

      intangible assets with indefinite useful lives such as goodwill and memberships are not amortized but are tested
      for impairment annually  either individually or at the cashgenerating unit level the assessment of indefinite life
      is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable if not the change in useful
      life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis

      gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net
      disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the income statement when the
      asset is derecognized

  intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straightline method with the following useful lives



  software                                                        3 to 10 years
  industrial rights                                               10 years
  useful lives of items recognized in business combinations       over its useful life between 5 to 9 years
  customer relationships                                          5 to 9 years
  noncompete agreements                                          6 years
  process technologies                                            5 to 6 years

  the useful lives of customer relationships and process technologies were adjusted in 2014 based on the effective
  useful lives of the intangible assets acquired in the prior period



  29      investment property

  the group classifies property for earning rentals or capital appreciation or both as investment properties
  as investment properties are accounted for using a cost model the same accounting policies applied to property
  plant and equipment are used for their accounting treatment except for their classification and presentation



  210     leases

  the determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement
  at inception date whether fulfillment of the arrangement depends on the use of a specific asset or assets and the                109
  arrangement conveys a right to use the asset even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement

  group as a lessee
  finance leases which transfer substantially to the group all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the
  leased item are capitalized at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or if lower at
  the present value of the minimum lease payments lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and
  reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability
  finance charges are recognized in finance costs in the income statement

  a leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset however if there is no reasonable certainty that the
  group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term the asset is depreciated over the shorter of its estimated
  useful life and the lease term

  operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense in the income statement on a straightline basis
  over the lease term

  group as a lessor
  leases in which the group does not substantially transfer all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset
  are classified as operating leases initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the
  carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income
  contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the period in which they are earned the group has not entered into
  finance lease agreements as a lessor




                                                                             songwon annual financial  sustainability report 2015

      211      impairment of nonfinancial assets

      the group reviews nonfinancial assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
      the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if any indication exists or when annual impairment testing for
      assets such as membership is required the group estimates the assets recoverable amount recoverability of assets
      is measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the recoverable amount which is the higher
      of the assets value in use and its fair value less costs to sell if assets do not generate cash inflows that are largely
      independent of those from other assets or groups of assets the impairment test is not performed at an individual
      asset level but at the level of the cashgenerating unit cgu to which the asset belongs

      where the carrying amount of an asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and
      is written down to its recoverable amount in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to
      their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
      and the risks specific to the asset in determining fair value less costs to sell recent market transactions are taken
      into account if available if no such transactions can be identified an appropriate valuation model is used

      for assets excluding goodwill an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication
      that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased if such an indication exists
      the group estimates the asset or cgus recoverable amount a previously recognized impairment loss is reversed
      only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last
      impairment loss was recognized the reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its
      recoverable amount nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation had no
      impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years such a reversal is recognized in the income statement

110   the following criteria are also applied in assessing impairment of specific assets

      goodwill
      goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of december 31 as well as whenever there are events or changes in
      circumstances triggering events which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable goodwill is carried
      at cost less accumulated impairment losses

      for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the groups
      of cgus that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination if the carrying amount of
      the cgus to which the goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss on goodwill is
      recognized the recoverable amount is the higher of the cgus fair value less costs to sell and its value in use
      impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods

      intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
      intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually as of december 31 either
      individually or at the cgu level as appropriate and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be
      impaired



      212      borrowing costs

      borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of an asset which necessarily
      takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the
      respective assets

  213     inventories

  inventory is valued at the lower of the acquisition or production cost and net realizable value cost being generally
  determined on the basis of a weighted average production costs comprise direct material and labor and applicable
  manufacturing overheads including depreciation charges based on normal operating capacity net realizable value
  is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling
  expenses



  214     cash and cash equivalents

  cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks as well as onhand and
  shortterm deposits with a maturity of three months or less



  215     provisions

  a provision is recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event
  it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
  can be made of the amount of the obligation if the effect is material provisions are recognized at present value by
  discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
  value of money



  216     pensions and other longterm employment benefits                                                                          111


  pensions
  the group operates three defined benefit pension plans one in korea one in switzerland and one in india
  the cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method

  remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses the effect of the asset ceiling excluding net interest and
  the return on plan assets excluding net interest are recognized immediately in the statement of financial position
  with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through oci in the period in which they occur
  remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods

  past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of
   the date of the plan amendment or curtailment

   the date that the group recognizes restructuringrelated costs



  net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset the pension
  expenses are recognized in the income statement under cost of sales and selling and administration costs

  other longterm employment benefits
  the parent company also implements a bonus plan designed to present a prescribed quantity of gold to longterm
  service employees and to entitle them to compensated vacation the bonus plans accounting policies are mostly the
  same as the defined benefit plan except that remeasurements are recognized immediately in profit or loss




                                                                             songwon annual financial  sustainability report 2015

      217      taxes

      current income tax
      current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered
      from or paid to the taxation authorities the tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are
      enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the group operates and generates
      taxable income

      deferred tax
      deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax
      basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes

      deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except
       where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a trans

         action that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit
         nor taxable profit or loss
       in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries associates and interests

         in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is proba
         ble that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future

      deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences carry forward of unused tax credits
      and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the
      deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be
      utilized except
112    where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of

         an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects
         neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss
       in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries associates and

         interests in joint ventures deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the
         temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the
         temporary differences can be utilized

      the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is
      no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be
      utilized unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that
      it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered deferred tax
      assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realized
      or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
      reporting date

      deferred tax relating to items recognized outside profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss deferred tax
      items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly
      in equity

      deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset  if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax

  218     revenue recognition

  revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and
  the revenue can be reliably measured revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
  receivable taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty the following
  specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognized

  sale of goods
  revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have
  passed to the buyer

  interest income
  for all financial instruments measured at amortized cost and interestbearing financial assets classified as
  available for sale interest income or expense is recorded using the effective interest rate eir this is the rate
  that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial
  instrument or a shorter period where appropriate to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability
  interest income is included in finance income in the income statement

  rental income
  rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straightline basis over
  the lease terms and included in revenue due to its operating nature

  dividends
  revenue is recognized when the groups right to receive the payment is established
                                                                                                                                       113


  219     financial instruments

  a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or
  equity instrument of another entity

  financial assets
  all financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus in the case of investments not at fair value through
  profit or loss directly attributable transaction costs apply purchases or sales of financial assets that require
  delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace regular way
  trades are recognized on the trade date ie the date that the group commits to purchase or sell the asset

  the subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification
   at fair value through profit or loss

   held to maturity

   loans and receivables

       inancial assets at fair value through profit or loss
      f
      financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and those designated
      upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss financial assets are classified as held for trading if they
      are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term this category includes derivative financial
      instruments entered into by the group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as
      defined by kifrs 1039 derivatives including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for
      trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments financial assets at fair value through profit
      and loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
      finance income or finance costs in the income statement

      the group has not designated any financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss

       oans and receivables
      l
      loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted
      in an active market after initial measurement such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost
      using the effective interest rate method eir less impairment amortized cost is calculated by taking into account
      any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir
      the eir amortization is included in finance income in the income statement the losses arising from impairment
      are recognized in the income statement in finance costs

      heldtomaturity investments
       nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as heldto
       maturity when the group has the positive intention and ability to hold it to maturity after initial measurement held
       tomaturity investments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less impairment
114    as for loans and receivables above the eir amortization is included in finance income in the income statement the
       losses arising from impairment are recognized in the income statement in finance costs

      a
      availableforsale financial investments include equity and debt securities equity investments classified as
      availableforsale are those which are neither classified as held for trading nor designated at fair value through
      profit or loss debt securities in this category are those which are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time
      and which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or to changes in market conditions

      after initial measurement availableforsale financial investments are subsequently measured at fair value with
      unrealized gains or losses recognized as other comprehensive income in the availableforsale reserve until the
      investment is derecognized at this time the cumulative gain or loss is recognized in other income or determined to
      be impaired and the cumulative loss is reclassified to the income statement in finance costs and removed from the
      availableforsale reserve

       the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the

         received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a passthrough arrangement and either
         a the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or b the group has neither
         transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the
         asset

  when the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a passthrough
  arrangement and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset nor
  transferred its control of the asset it is recognized to the extent of the groups continuing involvement in the asset
  in that case the group also recognizes an associated liability the transferred asset and the associated liability are
  measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the group has retained continuing involvement that
  takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of
  the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the group could be required to repay

  impairment of financial assets
  further disclosures relating to impairment of financial assets are also provided in the following notes
   note 3 disclosures for significant assumptions

   note 15 trade receivables



  at each reporting date the group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group
  of financial assets is impaired an impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the initial
  recognition of the asset an incurred loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial
  asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated evidence of impairment may include indications
  that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty default or delinquency in
  interest or principal payments the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization and
  observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows such as changes
  in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults

  
  financial  assets carried at amortized cost
  for financial assets carried at amortized cost the group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment
  exists for those that are individually significant or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant        115
  if the group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset
  whether significant or not it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics
  and collectively assesses them for impairment assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an
  impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment

  availableforsale financial investments
  in the case of equity investments objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair
  value of the investment below its cost  a significant decline is evaluated against the original cost of the investment
  and a prolonged decline against the period in which the fair value has been below its original cost
  in the case of debt instruments impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as financial assets carried at
  amortized cost however the amount recorded for impairment is the cumulative loss measured as the difference
  between the amortized cost and the current fair value less any impairment loss on that investment previously
  recognized in the income statement

  financial liabilities
  all financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings including
  directly attributable transaction costs
  the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification
   financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

   loans and borrowings



  the group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition

      financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial
      liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss financial liabilities are
      classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term this category includes
      derivative financial instruments entered into by the group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge
      relationships

      gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the income statement
      the group has not designated any financial liabilities upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss

      loans and borrowings
         after initial recognition interestbearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost
         using the effective interest rate eir method gains and losses are recognized in the income statement when the
         liabilities are derecognized as well as through the eir amortization process

      amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that
      are an integral part of the eir the eir amortization is included in finance costs in the income statement

      derecognition
        a financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged cancelled or expires
        when an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms
        or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified such an exchange or modification is treated as a
        derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability the difference in the respective carrying
        amounts is recognized in the income statement
116
      offsetting of financial instruments
      financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statement of
      financial position if and only if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and
      there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously

      derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
      the group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps
      to hedge its foreign currency interest rate and commodity price risks such derivative financial instruments are
      initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
      remeasured at fair value derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial
      liabilities when the fair value is negative

      c
       ash flow hedges
      any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the income statement
      except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges which is recognized in other comprehensive income amounts
      recognized as other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction
      affects profit or loss such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is recognized

      if the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gain or loss previously
      recognized in equity is transferred to the income statement if the hedging instrument expires or is sold terminated
      or exercised without replacement or rollover or if its designation as a hedge is revoked any cumulative gain or loss
      previously recognized in other comprehensive income remains in other comprehensive income until the forecast
      transaction or firm commitment affects profit or loss

      the group applies cash flow hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts

  220     new and amended standards and interpretations

  the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following
  amendments to kifrs effective as of january 1 2015 and as adopted by the group

  amendments to kifrs 1019 defined benefit plans employee contributions
  kifrs 1019 requires an entity to consider contributions from employees or third parties when accounting for
  defined benefit plans where the contributions are linked to service they should be attributed to periods of service
  as a negative benefit these amendments clarify that if the amount of the contributions is independent of the
  number of years of service an entity is permitted to recognize such contributions as a reduction in the service cost
  in the period in which the service is rendered instead of allocating the contributions to the periods of service this
  amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after july 1 2014 this amendment is relevant to the
  group since some of its entities have defined benefit plans with contributions from employees the standard was
  applied for the annual actuarial calculation as per december 31 2014

  the group has assessed that the aforementioned standards impact on its consolidated financial statements will not
  be significant for the year in which it applies this standard for the first time

      3	significant accounting judgments estimates and
         assumptions
      the preparation of the groups financial statements requires management to make judgments estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and the disclosure
      of contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period however uncertainty about these assumptions and
      estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or
      liability affected in future periods the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation
      uncertainty at the reporting date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
      amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are described below

      note     description      nature of estimation
      7 8    impairment       impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cashgenerating unit exceeds its
      9 10    of               recoverable amount which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in
               nonfinancial    use the determination of the recoverable amount of a cashgenerating unit involves the
               assets          use of estimates by management the fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on
               goodwill         available data from binding sales transactions in an arms length transaction of similar assets
                                or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset the value in
                                use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model the cash flows are derived from
                                the expectations for the next three years and do not include restructuring activities that the
                                group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the assets
                                performance of the cashgenerating unit being tested the recoverable amount based on the
                                value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model
                                wacc as well as the expected future cashinflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation
                                purposes the recoverable amount based on the fair value less cost to sell is most sensitive to
118                             the market prices premiums and the estimate of cost to sell these estimates including the
                                methodologies used can have a material impact on the fair value and ultimately the amount of

                                addition discounting is based on assumptions and estimations concerning businessspecific
                                capital costs which are themselves dependent on national risks and additional risks resulting

             other              and the present value of the pension obligation are determined using actuarial valuations
             employment         an actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions which may differ from actual
             benefits           developments in the future these include the determination of the discount rate future salary
                                increases mortality rates and future pension increases due to the complexity of the valuation
                                the underlying assumptions and its longterm nature a defined benefit obligation is highly
                                sensitive to changes in these assumptions

               of financial     position cannot be derived from active markets their fair value is determined using valuation

                                observable markets where possible but where this is not feasible a degree of judgment is
                                required in establishing fair values the judgments include considerations of inputs such as
                                liquidity risk credit risk and volatility changes in assumptions about these factors could affect
                                the reported fair value of financial instruments

  will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under kifrs either a full retrospective application
  or a modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2018 early
  adoption is permitted the group performed a preliminary assessment of kifrs 1115 which is subject to changes
  arising from a more detailed ongoing analysis the group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective                119
  date

  amendments to kifrs 1110 and kifrs 1028 sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its
  associate or joint venture
  the amendments address the conflict between kifrs 1110 and kifrs 1028 in dealing with the loss of control
  of a subsidiary that is sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture the amendments clarify that the gain
  or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that constitute a business as defined in kifrs 1103

  amendments are not expected to have any impact on the group

  amendments to kifrs 1111 joint arrangements accounting for acquisitions of interests
  the amendments to kifrs 1111 require that a joint operator accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint
  operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business must apply the relevant kifrs 1103
  principles for business combinations accounting the amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in
  a joint operation is not remeasured on the acquisition of an additional interest in the same joint operation while
  joint control is retained in addition scope exclusion has been added to kifrs 1111 to specify that the amendments
  do not apply when the parties sharing joint control including the reporting entity are under common control of
  the same ultimate controlling party the amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest in a joint
  operation and the acquisition of any additional interests in the same joint operation and are prospectively effective
  for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2016 with early adoption permitted these amendments are not

      amendments to kifrs 1016 and kifrs 1038 clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and
      amortization
      the amendments clarify the principle in kifrs 1016 and kifrs 1038 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic
      benefits that are generated from operating a business of which the asset is part rather than the economic benefits
      that are consumed through use of the asset as a result a revenuebased method cannot be used to depreciate
      property plant and equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances to amortize intangible assets
      the amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2016 with early
      adoption permitted these amendments are not expected to have any impact on the group as it has not used a
      revenuebased method to depreciate its noncurrent assets

      amendments to kifrs 1027 equity method in separate financial statements
      the amendments will allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries joint
      ventures and associates in their separate financial statements entities already applying kifrs and electing to
      change to the equity method in its separate financial statements will have to apply this change retrospectively
      the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2016 with early adoption
      permitted these amendments will not have any impact on the groups consolidated financial statements

      amendments to kifrs 1001 disclosure initiative
      the amendments to kifrs 1001 presentation of financial statements clarify rather than significantly change
      existing kifrs 1001 requirements
      the amendments clarify
       the materiality requirements in kifrs 1001

       that specific line items in the statements of profit or loss and oci and the statement of financial position may be

         disaggregated
120    that entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present the notes to financial statements

       that the share of oci of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method must be presented in

  the group performed its annual impairment test in december 2015 and 2014 the recoverable amount of the cgus
   to which goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated  has been determined based on its
  value in use calculated using the discounted cash flow dcf model

  as of december 31 2015 the recoverable amount of the main cgu rest of the group equals 900157 million krw
  2014 834795 million krw the recoverable amount of the cgu of songwon specialty chemicals  india pvt ltd
  india amounts to 33644 million krw or 1889 million inr 2014 24138 million krw or 1400 million inr

  there is no impairment loss recognized during 2015 according to the impairment test on goodwill and
  memberships as of the measurement date the recoverable amount based on the value in use in 2015 exceeded the
  carrying amount of the relevant cgus



  102     key assumptions used in calculation of value in use

  the calculation of the cgu value in use reflects the future cash flows for the next three years for the main cgu and
  for the next five years for swciin discounted to the present value at the weighted average cost of capital wacc
  and at an estimated residual value the projected cash flows are estimated based on the 2016 budget and 2016
  2020 business plan as approved by management and midterm assumptions for the free cash flows extending
  beyond the detailed planning period a terminal value was computed by capitalizing the normalized cash flows
  using a constant growth rate the longterm growth rate is aligned to blended longterm inflation expectations for
  relevant countries




                                                                              songwon annual financial  sustainability report 2015

      in addition a market risk premium of 600 2014 500 and a small cap premium of 374 2014 384 were
      applied for the calculation of the wacc

      the key assumptions underlying the calculation are as follows

      changes in market prices market prices comprise two types of risk
       interest rate risk

       foreign currency risk



      financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings deposits availableforsale

      positions at december 31 2015 and 2014

      interest rate risk

      of changes in market interest rates the groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates
      primarily to its interestbearing loans and borrowings as well as bank deposits with floating interest rates

      the groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates substantially to its interestbearing loans
      and borrowings with floating interest rates which makes the group exposed to cash flows risk responsively the
      group is minimizing the risk partially through interest rate swap contracts or choosing the most favorable financing
      instruments by switching to the loans with more favorable conditions or improving the groups credit rating

      interest rate sensitivity
      the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates the groups
      exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the groups interestbearing loans and
150   borrowings as well as bank deposits with floating interest rates with all other variables held constant the groups
      profit before tax is affected by the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows

      foreign currency risk
      the groups exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to its operating activities
      the risk of foreign exchange primarily relates to the us dollar usd euro eur swiss franc chf japanese yen
      jpy uae dirham aed and the indian rupee inr

      foreign exchange risks arise when commercial transactions recognized assets or liabilities are denominated in a
      currency that is not the entitys functional currency

      the objective of managing foreign currency risk is to maximize the value of the firm through minimizing the
      fluctuation of net profit and uncertainty arising from foreign currency fluctuation to accomplish this the group
      uses a strategy to accord the collection terms of receivables and payment terms of payables denominated in usd
      considering the similar volume of exports and imports with regard to eur and jpy the group manages the risk
      through currency forward contracts
