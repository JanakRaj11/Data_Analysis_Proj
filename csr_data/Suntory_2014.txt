  chance to take part in a water resource cultivation activity held at the natural water
  sanctuary this project is well known as an excellent approach in the field of biodiversity
  preservation as i walked through the forest i could feel suntorys enthusiasm about the
  natural water sanctuaries and this made me realize how special this project is

       to stably deliver highquality products and services to customers it is essential to have good cooperative
       relationships with business partners
       in addition social requirements regarding compliance human rights and the environment have increased throughout
       the world for these reasons csr activities are necessary for group companies as well as supply chains in fact some
       global companies have been accused of not giving due consideration to human rights and labor environments in their
       business transactions with suppliers
       suntory group views equitable and fair transactions with business partners extremely important in the realization of
       sustainable society through business activities and strives to ensure social responsibility throughout supply chains
       in order to fulfill such responsibility we established the suntory groups basic policy on supply chain csr which
       includes six core items legal compliance human rights and labor standards quality environment information
       security and coexisting with society
       we also give supply chain csr initiative briefings and questionnaires to business partners to monitor the status of

        back then everything from the buildings and equipment to even the vineyards themselves
        was in a desolate state we totally renewed the equipment by combining traditional and
        modern techniques and went forward with the replanting of over 60 hectares of the
        abandoned and deserted vineyards in order to achieve the reconstruction preserving the
        good old local traditions we hired young and talented french engineers and experts with
        rich experiences from the local area at important positions in winemaking and
        management the japanese representatives have always taken a longterm view in the
        management of the chateau in cooperation with them and finally château lagrange has
        resurrected its reputation enough to have been chosen as the venue for 2013 la fête de la
        fleur the flower festival the most important event in the wine industry after 30 years
