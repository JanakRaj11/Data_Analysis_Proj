screenʼs crt mask division started operations in 1963 this core
business was supported for years by demand from the dynamic
television color television and computer monitor markets and had a
worldwide market share of 15 in its golden age in fact it supported
dainippon screenʼs operations for years in recent times however the
emergence of new technologies that have begun to replace crts
including ﬂat panel displays many of which use lcd panels have led
to a shrinking of the crt market since this inevitably led to shrinking
proﬁts screen initially transferred the division to a subsidiary dstm
but in october 2005 the company determined that it had no choice
but to leave the crt mask business entirely liquidation of dstm was
completed in march 2006 and the company will now shift its focus to
lcds which are entering their 7th and 8th generations and other
cuttingedge growing ﬁelds of business

reviewing the screen groupʼs 2005 activities
screenʼs results in our environmental conservation eﬀorts within our manufacturing activities exceeded all
expectations we were able to achieve our goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste
production both overall and within each source category our green oﬃce product procurement eﬀorts
and the adoption of ecologicallyfriendly vehicles are also advancing well and we will continue our eﬀorts
in this regard at the same time we have ﬁnally made the necessary preparations to promote the product
stewardship that is our duty as a manufacturer we will now begin implementing various core systems
management indicators and technology standards such as our green product recognition system and our
green procurement standards our environmental and safety management assessment system will help us
ensure that the products released by each of our divisions are more environmentally friendly while
reducing production losses

   flash lamp annealing system la3000f
   semiconductor equipment company
the la3000f ﬂash lamp annealing system is
a heattreatment unit that oﬀers faster
processing thanks to highly eﬃcient annealing

the la3000f features four chambers an aligner chamber
a cooling chamber a tp chamber and a process chamber as well
as an indexer and two foups
      this unit is an annealing system that oﬀers the ultraquick
processing that is required for sourcedrain ultrashallow junctions
      the light from the la3000fʼs light source a xenon ﬂash
lamp is easily absorbed into silicon which enables more eﬃcient
annealing this xenon ﬂash lamp can produce light in bursts of just
a few milliseconds making ultraquick processing a reality
the la3000f draws much less electric power than similar spike
annealing units  only about one third as much  and even during
constant operation it uses only half the power which makes this a
particularly environmentallyfriendly product

                                     the pi8200 is an allinone highspeed optical
                                     inspection system that is suitable for the
                                     inspection of a wide range of printed circuit
                                     boards from extremely highdensity boards to

                                        the pi8200 features four diﬀerent inspection modes which
                                        make it possible to perform faster inspection for line widths
                                        ranging from 40 m to 120 m for a line width of 75 microns
                                        for example the pi8200 supports 12 higher throughput
                                     2 faster setup
                                        transmission to the image processing board is 60 faster
                                        than with the pi8000 and the main cpuʼs processing speed is

thirdparty opinions of screenʼs environmental initiatives and
environmental and social report
 screenʼs environmental initiatives
judging dainippon screen mfg co ltdʼs environmental initiatives from the point of view of
material ﬂow the company appears to be doing quite well the reduction in business activities
that require large amounts of energy is particularly noteworthy and the fact that screen has
decreased the amount of both greenhouse gases and waste it produces is impressive as well
whatʼs more their work on lessening carbon dioxide emissions during product transport as well
as their eﬀorts to clean up the soil around their business sites certainly deserves praise
     the next thing screen needs to do is reduce the overall environmental impact of its supply
chain and review product lifecycles to become more environmentally responsible i look forward
to seeing how they go about it


 environmental management system
screen has received iso14001 iso9001 and ohsas18001 certiﬁcation at all of its business
sites for their management systems but it seems like these business sites each achieved
certiﬁcation through independent initiatives in the future i think screen needs to unify its
eﬀorts bearing in mind its csr and risk management goals and expand its initiatives to
the entire screen group to create more eﬃcient and eﬀective management systems




                                                                                                                                                     third party opinions
 environmental and social report
what used to be screenʼs environmental report has been expanded into an environmental and
social report this year i realize it is the new formatʼs ﬁrst year but i think there is room for
improvement in the information presented i hope you will review the principles governing
appropriate and critical information for environmental and social reports and oﬀer an even
better presentation of relevant information in the future
     in particular the report is missing critical human resource data data for the various
business sites information on compliance with applicable laws and audit results for
                                                                                                                                                            38
