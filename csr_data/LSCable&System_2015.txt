     history and inspection status were reviewed and then the level of risk by case was assessed through the discussion of inhouse experts in the areas
     of quality design manufacturing and technology development as a result they selected a total of 29 cases as verification targets including 13 cases
     for pmj 7 for eba 7 for ebgo 1 for link box and 1 for quality system when they were verified 8 cases were categorized as quickwin item and 21 as
     detailed verification item
     in regards to the results of verification activities actions have been taken to maintain and manage the results by reflecting them in the company stan
     dards and by signing an inspection agreement with material and part suppliers a thorough analysis on accidents and 4m changes and a meticulous
     verification of the impact between materials and parts will be conducted so as to secure the reliability of transmission lines

risk and opportunity from climate change
climate change can be either a risk or an opportunity for business management in order to turn a climate change risk into an opportunity and
to turn an opportunity to greater opportunity we respond to this issue with two approaches mitigation and adaptation
