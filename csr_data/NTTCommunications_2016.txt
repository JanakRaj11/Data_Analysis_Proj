       progress in the further strengthening of initiatives based on new mediumterm targets in line with the
       changing times




   activity achievements in line with csr indexes

with regard to two of the priority activities namely the development of a ubiquitous network infrastructure and the ensuring of highly stable and
reliable missioncritical infrastructure we were able to achieve and almost achieve the targets we had set in contrast our engagement in
social contribution activities was not always adequate and it cannot be said that we achieved our targets so further improvements in awareness
and enforcement activities are necessary at all workplaces commencing in fiscal 2015 we have been conducting a reexamination that takes into
account social and our own circumstances

   helping healthy child development

industrywide efforts toward child pornography
countermeasures
the blocking of child pornography on the internet is an important
issue that must be addressed naturally in order to protect the human
rights of children and to prevent childrens participation in human
rights abuses and ensure the provision of a safe internet environment
taking in particular the opportunity presented by the japanese
governments release of its policy on a national campaign against
child pornography in 2010 the setting up of an active system
including the voluntary blocking of access to child pornography
websites by internet service providers ispsis continuing with
support from the public and private sectors in 2011 the ntt
communications group joined other isps search engine service
providers filtering service providers and related businesses to form
the internet content safety association icsa in april 2011
members of the icsa began to share information on the websites
they will block to prevent access to child pornography images by
providing other member providers with child pornography website
address lists
    specifically the ntt communications groups goo plala and
ocn services have access restrictions based on child pornography
website address lists provided by the icsa in line with the child
pornography website address lists provided by the icsa steps were
also taken to block child pornographic images by each of the isp
providers in 2011 and ntt resonant is responding by modifying the
various search services that it operates

we consider initiatives that we term perspectives as a responsibility that companies should fulfill for their employees in keeping with this belief
we engaged in a number of themes and have steadily achieved results in each the themes included the promotion of working style reform
support for balancing child raisingnursing care and careers and improving the statutory ratio for the employment of people with disabilities
    in actively utilizing the diversity of our personnel we are also building systems to enable companies and their employees to grow together
as these moves are indispensable for a global ict corporate group that continues to provide value to society we are accelerating the pace of

environmental management

  promotion framework toward reduction of environmental impact and fiscal 2015 initiatives


in order to continuously promote environmental protection initiatives we formed a working group for each issue involving the entire ntt group
in tackling environmental issues specifically we hold environmental protection subcommittee meetings at group companies twice a year to
formulate an overall plan encompassing a wide range of issues including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and waste and the
promotion of environmental solutions through these meetings we also share information on the results of actions taken and promote the
horizontal deployment of various initiatives in recent years in particular we have been making efforts to ascertain and curb environmental impact
by means of scope 3 at the supply chain level and have expanded the scope of the categories covered since fiscal 2014
    as far as the environmental management structure for our bases in japan is concerned we are promoting environmental protection activities
at 14 companies at our overseas bases with a view to promoting global environmental management we are expanding our management bases
assigning officers responsible for environmental matters gathering activity information and encouraging the sharing of information between
bases in japan and overseas in the years to come we will hold global environmental management meetings and would like for these to lead to
further reductions in environmental impact

   we are accelerating global efforts to reduce the carbon footprint
of our data centers by continuing to introduce leadingedge
equipment and technologies

ongoing efforts to cut air conditioner power
consumption at existing telecoms facilities
having targeted a 20 reduction in the electricity consumed by air
conditioning we have implemented a range of measures such as
smartdash an automated system that visualizes temperature zones
in server rooms detects areas that are too cold and automatically
readjusts temperatures as well as aisle capping which is a technique      click here for details regarding solar power generation
that physically separates the intake low temperature and exhaust
high temperature air from it equipment by strategically placing vinyl
sidewalls and ceilings around it equipment in the aisles between rows
of server racks
    in fiscal 2015 we implemented airflow improvement initiatives
across a total of 135 buildings for the purpose of optimizing the use
of electricity in air conditioning
    key initiatives included the installation of blank panels which
block the front of unused spaces in server racks in telecommunica
tions buildings and data center buildings as well as measures to
improve airflow such as the integration of hot air flows from ict
equipment and the adjustment of cold air flowing up from the floor
other measures entailed upgrading to highefficiency air conditioners
reviewing energyconserving operations and optimizing room
temperature moreover we upgraded all lighting to leds in japan
    ntt communications will continue to implement measures in japan
and overseas to bring about further reductions in power consumption

in addition to summer and winter energysaving measures the ntt
communications group implements ongoing electricitysaving
measuresincluding the use of energysaving settings on pcs the
operation of fewer lighting fixtures and elevators and the adjustment
of airconditioner settingsand strives to reduce its energy consump
tion in japan
    during the summer months the group targeted a reduction in
electricity consumption of 30 from the fiscal 2010 level over the
period in question the group accordingly undertook a variety of
measures for example every effort was made to maintain higher
airconditioner settings at 28c in summer cut back the number of
lights employed encourage the use of stairs when going up four floors        encouraging energy conservation in offices by finely
or down five and encourage employees to wear summer clothing and             managing individual air conditioners
switch off office automation equipment when leaving the office               ntt communications manages individual air conditioners for each
thanks largely to these endeavors in fiscal 2015 the group achieved a        floor section of its office buildings as a way to conserve energy at

air pollution countermeasures
our business activities emit nox and sox which cause air pollution
approximately 70 of the nox emissions are attributable to the use
of gasoline and diesel in our operational vehicles with the remaining
30 are emitted during the generation of electric power in
communications buildings and other facilities most sox around
93 is emitted during generation of the electricity we use
    in fiscal 2015 we reduced our emissions of both nox by 0 tons
year on year to 463 tons and sox by 0 tons to 90 tons by 22 in
both cases thanks to the lower levels of electric power consumed in
the years to come we will encourage driving techniques that show
consideration for the environment and review our vehicle fleet
numbers while promoting the mitigation of global warming and the
prevention of air pollution by taking steps to reduce electricity usage
in our businesses

   chemical substance management in anticipation of
   emergency situations

against a backdrop of natural disasters that are occurring frequently
on a global scale in recent years society has shown a growing
interest in the management systems needed for environmental pollut
ants in times of emergency owning and operating it infrastructure
throughout the world we have been thorough in establishing storage
and management systems while bearing unlikely events in mind for
some time
    in the management of pollutants and pcbs in particular we have
implemented measures that recognize such factors as earthquakes
fires flood controls lightning protection puncture resistance ventila
tion and security by carrying out periodic inspections we are
constantly confirming that such substances are properly managed
with regard to such events as major earthquakes and disasters we
have built a rapid verification system designed not only to prevent
damage when a disaster first strikes but also from the perspective of
preventing secondary disasters we exercise great care in conducting
uninterrupted operations safely and securely

in line with our policy of making an early effort to conduct the
detoxification processing of pcbs in fiscal 2014 we conducted the
processing of those stored in kyushu and hokkaido we will process
the remainder held in tokyo and osaka as soon as processing center
preparations are complete we have no plans to transport import or
