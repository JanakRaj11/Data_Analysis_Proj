    utilizing the best mix of energy for an ongoing response to the needs of society
     environmentally friendly lpg and natural gas 
    lpg is a clean energy supporting our daily lives and industries in japan we have strived to establish a stable supply system
    and a wide dissemination of lpg for more than half a century and now our efforts extend to the expansion of the natural
    gas supply area using our proprietary cryogenic technologies built up over the years with our thoughts constantly turned
    toward customer satisfaction we will continue to offer the best mix of energy needed by the society



    continuous supply networks from import to delivery                              making lpg more environmentally friendly

    lpg is a form of clean energy that generates very small quantities              iwatani has also striven for innovations in the distribution and
    of co2 when burning it does not need an underground pipeline                   propagation of lpg for instance our bulk supply system distrib

enefarm a fuel cell cogeneration system for home use is a               liquid natural gas lng is also clean energy and like lpg emits
nextgeneration energy system that extracts hydrogen from lpg or           only a small amount of co2 and nitrogen oxides when burning
city gas supplies generates electricity using the fuel cell and          because its supply is stable demand for lng has been increasing
simultaneously produces hot water from heat produced in this               year by year and an increasing number of manufacturers have
generation as an innovation for energy usage in our daily lives          changed their energy source from conventional heavy oil to
enefarm provides excellent total energy efficiency contributes           natural gas iwatani s supply strategy for lng is also unique
to energy saving and reduction in co2 emissions and is expected           in 2007 we established koga energy co ltd jointly with kansai
to be a driving force to realize a low carbon society                     electric power co inc and koga kyodo gas co ltd a satellite
iwatani has conducted largescale demonstration tests towards              base was constructed in the premises and pipelines connecting to
the introduction of enefarm with a total of 83 test units since           customer facilities were laid down for fullscale lng supply
fy2005 we have also adjusted the sales system by utilizing our            services lng is also supplied to koga kyodo gas which then
sales network for lpg provided education and training courses for         supplies it to general households this system was the first case of
sales staff and built an installation and maintenance system in          converting local energy to lng in japan in 2009 koga energy
july 2009 we started selling this reformed lpg type enefarm in           constructed additional storage tanks to increase the total storage
our lpg sales areas in addition to our own sales channels we             capacity thereby ensuring stable supply
teamed up with housing constructors to take the first step for             in july 2009 iwatani invested in tango gas co ltd located in the
fullscale sales of enefarm our promotional activities have              northern part of kyoto prefecture this is our first fullscale partici

we have also promoted a w double power generation that                  decided to convert to high calorie gas and iwatani supplies lng
combines enefarm with solar generation a form of clean energy            as the raw material
with no co2 emissions it not only reduces electricity bills but also     demand for lng is increasing all over the country in a satellite
allows consumers to sell surplus electricity from local generation         supply system lng is supplied by the tank lorry to the customer s
to utility companies with this form of power generation an annual        facilities which consist of receiving storage and vaporization
reduction of 80 or about 42 tons of co2 emissions is expected           installations built into the customer s premises iwatani has
in the average household as well as a considerable reduction in           already supplied lng to many users through our satellite supply
energy costs much is expected of the system both environmen             systems and established a largescale supply network extending
tally and economically                                                    from the kanto to chugoku and shikoku areas the annual volume

                                                                           the volume handled by a large regional city gas company


information from energy seminars

iwatani has also helped manufacturers convert their conventional
energy to lpg and natural gas and made notable achievements in
reductions in co2 emissions hoping to utilize of our experience and
knowhow in this area we hold energy seminars in various locations to
provide information to those who work at production sites and are
concerned about the environmental friendliness of their factories the
potential of energy conversion and associated improvements in
productivity our energy diagnosis for individual energy sources is a
part of a comprehensive energy solution including facility design
