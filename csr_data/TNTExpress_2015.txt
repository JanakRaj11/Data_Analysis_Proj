the launch of new services to hanover and venice the coverage expansion of our premium 1200 pm
express product in germany and the reduction of road transit times to turkey and southern europe are
all tangible examples of service improvements in our core european network with more to follow
in 2014 we had to take significant restructuring provisions and oneoff charges these charges testify to
the scale of the transformation that needs to happen and to the determination of the new management
team to do whatever it takes to bring tnt back to its old glory in 2014 we did not yet realise quality
revenue growth and profitability we are still in a stage of improving the quality of our revenue base and
winning back customers that were lost over the last few years
but with servicequality improving in our unique european road network and european air network and
the benefits of newly recruited leadership we should be able to reverse any negative trends and
achieve profitable growth
outlook is supported by a fouryear investment programme 2014 to 2017 to realise superior service at
competitive cost we are investing in our highly competitive european road network expanding
destinations and modernising our hubs and depots a major overhaul in our airhub in liege should be
finalised in 2016 and will benefit our service capability in and out of europe at the end of 2014 we
contracted three global it service providers to help simplify and transform our it infrastructure capital
expenditure for the full year 2014 was 190 million
the outlook strategy was launched in 2014 the strategy is clear and builds on tnts core strengths
our confidence to realise the full benefits of outlook in the next three to five years is based on the
orange spirit of tnts people the loyalty of tnts customers and our unique european road network
and european air network the newly appointed management teams are competent and experienced

experienced further improvements notably in the performance of the domestic businesses in italy brazil
and chile despite continued negative mix effects in the united kingdom france australia and new

i general market and business profile
market overview
tnt operates in the courier express and parcel cep market and collects transports and delivers
documents parcels and palletised freight on a daydefinite or timedefinite basis its services are
primarily classified by the speed distance weight and size of consignments whereas the majority of its
shipments are between businesses b2b tnt also offers businesstoconsumer b2c services to
select key customers

within the cep market tnt provides express and economy express services the express services
are daydefinite and delivered nextday or fastestbyair for distances for which nextday is not possible
the economy express services are also daydefinite and are delivered fastestbyroad except for
intercontinental deliveries which depend on air for both express and economy express services tnt
has timedefinite options for customers requiring delivery before a certain time eg 1200 pm tnt
also provides specialised or extremely urgent deliveries which include products such as sameday
valueadded and nonstandard freight services geographically tnt differentiates between domestic
intraregional and intercontinental shipments it also differentiates between parcels and freight with a
cutoff point at 30 kilogrammes per consignment

there are two types of express players global integrators  so called due to their worldwide integrated
networks and doortodoor delivery capability  and localregional express operators four global
integrators  dhl express fedex ups and tnt  have the largest share of the intraregional and
intercontinental segments localregional operators are often well positioned in their respective domestic
or regional markets as for the european economy parcels market which is mainly domestic larger
competitors are dpd a subsidiary of frances la postes geopost and general logistics systems a
royal mailowned parcel delivery group

competition in the express market focuses on network coverage speed reliability quality of customer
service and price new entrants into the express market may come from the parcel and freight sectors
where companies might improve their range of services by including daydefinite products

market dynamics

the cep market in particular the express business is highly cyclical an important development over
the last two decades has been the emergence of endtoend global supply chains which is
strengthening the relationship between express delivery and trade flows due to the close relationship
between trade flows and economic development a strong correlation exists between the development
of the express delivery industry and real gdp gross domestic product development the growth of
the global economy remained weak in 2014

other key factors that affect tnts performance are
 demand for express and economy express
 customer mix
 ecommerce
 base price and surcharges
 wage and inputcost inflation
 fuel prices
 operational efficiency and productivity
 foreign currency volatility

chapter 2

in brazil the social integration programa de integração social pis and the social contribution on
billing contribuição para o financiamento da seguridade social cofins programmes levy taxes
which are highly regulated and represent a significant share of the overall brazilian tax collection

pis is conceived as a means to share business profits with the employees through a mandatory
national savings programme financed by monthly deposits collected as a percentage of gross sales
cofins was created to finance special social programmes enforced by the federal government
through the collection of a social contribution which is a percentage of revenues previously in the
absence of clear guidance under ifrs tnt accounted for these taxes as taxes on profit since and
although the tax is levied as a percentage of revenues certain cost credits are to be taken into account
to arrive at the taxes due

however it is now more customary to account for piscofins taxes as an adjustment of revenue and
affected cost as a result tnt has decided to change its accounting regarding piscofins as such a
change is deemed to result in the financial statements providing more reliable and relevant information
about the effects of its financial performance

segment overview

adjusted operating income is calculated as operating income after adjusting for oneoffs and is prepared
by management to analyse the results excluding nonrecurring items for a better understanding of the
business performance the presentation and disclosure of adjusted operating income does not conform
to ifrs

the following tables provide a reconciliation of revenues and adjusted operating income between the old
and new reportable segments for the full year 2014 taking into account the change in the accounting
policy for piscofins and the change from constant foreign exchange rates to respective foreign
exchange rates

in 2014 overall revenues declined by 32 due to a mix of factors the sale of china domestic in
november 2013 and tnt fashion in may 2014 41 and negative foreign exchange movements
09 at a comparable scope and constant foreign exchange rates revenue increased by 18
primarily as a result of growth in international europe and international amea

tnt recorded an operating loss of 86 million in 2014 compared to operating income of 9 million in
2013 contributing to this loss position were the significant efforts undertaken in 2014 to transform the
business which resulted in total restructuring and restructuringrelated expenses of 159 million total
impairments amounted to 38 million and included goodwill impairment of 32 million in spain due to
the updated management structure which resulted in a revised structure of cashgenerating units
cgus

a provision of 50 million was recognised relating to an investigation of alleged anticompetitive
behaviour in the french parcels delivery sector by the french competition authorities fca while a
profit of 7 million was recognised relating to the sale of the tnt fashion activities in the netherlands

in 2014 the negative impact of foreign exchange movements on operating income was 11 million
compared to 2013 adjusted operating income increased by 201 or 35 million despite a decline in
international europe 2 million as this was compensated by improved adjusted operating income in
international amea 27 million and domestics 15 million predominantly driven by positive
developments in brazil

international europes revenues increased by 08 or 15 at constant foreign exchange rates tnt
exited a number of express customers with low yields this resulted in a reduction in consignment
volumes revenue per consignment improved by 37 as pressure on prices was compensated by an
increased average consignment weight and stronger growth in international europes international
products growth in the sme customer segment improved during the year

in the latter part of 2014 13 million was invested in the relaunch of tnt in addition significant
investments were made to improve service levels in tnts core european market to support future
growth while many operating units experienced healthy profit developments the performance of the
segment was lower due to lower revenues in uk international and france international and the
economic situation in russia

investments made in the european road network and to a lesser extent in the european air network in
order to drive future growth and productivity positively impacted international europes service coverage
and capacity

international europes service levels improved by the end of the year as evidenced by the results of
customer satisfaction surveys

in 2014 international amea experienced an acceleration of revenue growth throughout the year year
onyear revenue growth corrected for the sale of china domestic in november 2013 was 60 or 74
at constant foreign exchange rates the sale of china domestic contributed to the 826 reduction in
average kilogrammes per day shipped as well as the increase in the revenue per kilogramme from
062 to 309 excluding the effect of the sale of china domestic average kilogrammes shipped per
day showed an increase yearonyear

all operating units experienced revenue growth including greater china which is international ameas
largest and key operating unit in the first quarter tnt launched the enhanced liability option for
customers in east asia and greater china which generated an additional 10 million revenue

adjusted operating income margin improved to 56 in 2014 from 23 in 2013 supported by the
growth in higher margin import products which is a key strategic focus area for international amea the
improvement was also supported by higher volumes on intercontinental aircraft in and out of china
which experienced an 18 growth in volumes yearonyear

indirect costs remained flat in euro terms despite fairly high levels of salary inflation in a number of
certain key markets this was achieved by a focus on cost reduction underpinned by the deliver
improvement programme launched in 2013 which continued throughout 2014 and included the
centralisation of billing for east asia into a billing centre in bangalore india

revenues for the segment decreased by 07 of which 11 was due to the negative impact of foreign
exchange movements heavy competition in the european domestic markets combined with
rationalisation of lossmaking customers in italy could not be fully offset by healthy growth in brazil

revenue per consignment remained relatively flat due to yield improvements in brazil and chile and an
overall improved customer mix in italy which compensated for the general price pressure in the
european domestic markets revenues in the sme customer segment started to pickup in the second
half of 2014




                                                                                                     20

business performance
chapter 2

yearonyear performance in brazil and italy improved while performance in chile remained reasonably
flat despite the growth in average consignments per day in the united kingdom france australia and
new zealand performance in these markets was weaker due to pressure on prices and service
investments

significantly improved with a renewed focus on compliance additional investments in equipment fleet
and infrastructure and the rollout of various operational excellence programmes such as perfect
depot

management approach dma for only material aspects and at least one indicator related to each
identified material aspect in compliance with g4 tnt explains how it manages each material aspect
and reports relevant indicators over time

to identify the crrelated aspects that are most relevant for tnt an annual online survey is conducted
with the six main stakeholder groups as defined by tnt customers employees subcontractors

apparent interest in tnt while all other stakeholder groups are selected to ensure diverse geographical
coverage in addition tnt systematically engages with individual stakeholders to obtain their
perspectives input and feedback on its business and operational activities the survey outcome and
stakeholder feedback provide guidance for developing and improving tnts cr strategy and activities

relevant for tnt the stakeholders identified and prioritised the aspects they deemed most important for
tnt the sixteen highest ranking crrelated aspects are reflected in the following matrix the
horizontal axis reflects the relative importance according to the stakeholders the cr steering

corporate responsibility risk management and monitoring

tnt applies continuous formal and structured cr risk management and a cr reporting system it
identifies crrelated risks linked to business and operational activities and works to reduce these
through the implementation of risk management controls where possible global best practices are
implemented to monitor reduce and mitigate these risks the main crrelated risks are linked to safety
incidents and accidents co2 emission rights regulations related to environment and climate change
and restrictions on the use of vehicles refer to section v of chapter 4 for more information

the principal monitoring and control processes for cr are
 a global reporting and consolidation system that tracks cr data supported by a dedicated cr
   reporting function under the responsibility of the cfo
 a nonfinancial letter of representation with crrelated questions with signoff by senior
   management to confirm the reliability of provided data and the compliance with policies
 a review of control processes based on the internal control for cr iccr framework and
 an independent examination performed by the external auditors including reliance on an objective
   assurance review performed by the internal auditors

on a monthly basis tnt uses a monitoring and reporting system to measure progress on relevant key
performance indicators kpi cr targets and kpis are integral to tnts performance management
framework

ii health and safety
management and performance

tnt manages health and safety via a systemsbased approach the health and safety policies and
management framework are based on the international ohsas 18001 standard all operating units are
required to achieve and maintain external certification to this standard as a minimum in addition to
national and local regulatory standards

health and safety risks associated with operational activities are identified and assessed and
subsequently managed and controlled to acceptable levels by implementing effective risk controls within
operational processes each operating unit has a documented risk assessment process in place to
control this particular risk at a local level

tnt monitors its performance through a set of performance metrics the main kpi for safety is the lost
time accident lta ratio the lta ratio is defined as the number of employees that are absent from
work as a result of a workrelated workplace or road traffic accident for at least one working day in the
reporting period excluding the day the accident occurred per 100 fte annual targets are set to drive
performance improvements tnts health and safety performance is included in the performance
management framework and is subject to quarterly reviews

tnt acknowledges the safety record of its entire operation a significant part of which is executed by
subcontractors where possible subcontractors are involved in improvement initiatives and training
programmes

preventive measures
tnt uses the safe vehicle safe driver safe journey approach to identify and implement effective risk
mitigation measures for road safety tnt pursues continuous improvement in each of these areas in
addition to subcontractor management the main challenge in reducing road accidents is to ensure
consistent application of this approach particularly in lessdeveloped countries and to ensure that
subcontractors adopt corresponding standards in practice where applicable tnt promotes the
improvement of the quality of public infrastructure which is another relevant factor in enhancing road
safety

subcontractors since blameworthiness in accidents involving subcontractors cannot currently be
officially established by tnt all fatal accidents irrespective of blameworthiness are reported

the improvement of the lta ratio in 2014 is supported by continued focus on safety enhancement

key initiatives

health and safety initiatives
these initiatives include health assessments injury rehabilitation screening for medical conditions
safety training drivers and workplace driver recognition programmes road safety charters and safe
driving competitions for employees and subcontractors example initiatives are

safety culture initiatives
to complement safety standards controls and tools tnt continues to strengthen its safety culture this
is done by addressing the attitudes beliefs perceptions and values of employees and subcontractors
with regards to safety tnt promotes a safety culture in which management exhibits leadership and
commitment to safety and all employees assume responsibility for the health and safety of themselves
and others

the tnt hub in liège belgium rolled out a threeyear programme designed to reinforce its safety
culture and improve its lta ratio by 50 this target was achieved three months prior to the completion
of the programme several behaviourbased safety tools and bestpractice techniques are being
applied including extensive training and coaching

outlook and commitments
health and safety is an integral part of realising the perfect transaction and will help to integrate health
and safety behaviour in daily operations

tnts most relevant overall safety target is the reduction of ltas the objective is to realise 20 lta per
100 fte by 2015 compared to 269 in 2014 in support of this target in 2014 tnt adopted a health
and safety action plan based on recognised industry best practices the action plan has ten focus
areas as shown below the development and deployment of the action plan is led by tnt health and
safety professionals from the operating units and head office successful deployment at subcontractors
is a high priority

iii environment
management and performance

tnt considers energy and carbon efficiency to be a priority therefore tnt is committed to mitigating
its environmental impact with a focus on three areas
 operations improve co2e efficiency and air quality of activities including subcontractors
 customers provide co2e information to customers and help them reduce their emissions
 people encourage awareness and train employees and subcontractors in environmental
     management

tnt manages its environmental footprint via a systemsbased approach its environmental policies and
management framework are based on the international iso 14001 standard all operating units are
required to achieve and maintain external certification to this standard as a minimum in addition to
national and local regulatory standards

tnts environmental management system is used to plan implement monitor manage and improve
the environmental impact of its activities tnt includes environmental requirements in its capital
expenditure and procurement review process the environmental impact of tnts fleet and
infrastructure at each important juncture planning acquisition and operation are managed in addition
guidelines for subcontractors and suppliers are in place to ensure they meet tnts environmental
requirements

tnt benchmarks its energy and carbon approach and performance against its peers via the carbon
disclosure project in 2014 tnt scored 89 out of a possible 100 in the carbon disclosure project
2013 88

in the 2013 annual report mediumterm targets were disclosed on global initiatives related to tnts own
fleet with the objective to improve co2 efficiency the following table highlights tnts progress in
attaining these targets where possible subcontractors will continue to be involved in initiatives to
reduce tnts overall co2 footprint

figures with a  fall within the reasonable assurance scope



progress has been made in attaining these mediumterm targets and at the end of 2014 most of tnts
own vehicles in the european union have at least the euro 4 standard the reported percentage of own
drivers trained in ecodriving is only based on the number of drivers that were trained in 2014 drivers
are trained regularly however not on an annual basis

environmental performance is measured through kpis related to energy absolute co2 emission and
co2 efficiency

in 2014 tnt adopted the european standard en 16258 this standard establishes a common
methodology for the calculation and declaration of energy consumption and greenhouse gas ghg
emissions related to transport services this is a change compared to the disclosures in the 2013
annual report the environmental kpis will reflect the adoption of en 16258 by disclosing the energy
and ghg emissions using the en 16258 default emissions factors thus presenting co2 equivalent
co2e emissions instead of only co2 in addition co2e will be presented as welltowheel emissions
instead of tanktowheel vehicle fleet will now be aligned with operations and segmented into pud and
linehaul vehicles instead of small trucks and vans and large trucks

the adoption of en 16258 has not impacted the collection process of data via the operating units and
the methodology for estimating the subcontractor co2e emissions




                                                                                                                      27

in 2014 the total co2e emissions of tnts own and subcontractor operations scope 1 2 and 3 of the
ghg protocol increased by 25 to 2915 ktonnes the co2e emissions of tnts own operations
scope 1 and 2 increased in absolute terms by 24 to 1315 ktonnes 2013 1284 as a result of
higher air and road linehaul operation activity levels co2e emissions of subcontractor operations
scope 3 increased by 25 to 1600 ktonnes in 2014 55 of total co2e emissions was related to
subcontractor operations

the co2e efficiency of tnts air operations in europe measured in co2e per freight tonne kilometre
improved in 2014 due to the transition to more fuelefficient aircraft and improved load factors the
co2e efficiency of pud vehicles and linehaul vehicles measured in co2e per kilometre improved due
to the transition to newer fuelefficient vehicles and increased focus on driver behaviour the relatively
warm winter in europe in the beginning of 2014 led to the reported improvement of the co2e efficiency
of tnts buildings

key initiatives

operations

road
in all major operating units electric and lowcarbon emitting vehicles and electricassisted tricycles
continue to be tested and deployed particularly for city deliveries fuelefficient innovations such as
telematics doubledeck trailers alternative fuel vehicles multimodal shipments and aerodynamic
vehicle equipment were also tested by additional operating units to ensure maximum impact and
scalability best practices are shared and where possible replicated on a larger scale including
subcontractors

tnt is constantly optimising the configuration of its network which has an impact on its co2e footprint
a number of projects have been rolled out including
 the road operations supply chain optimisation rosco project which aims to redesign the
   network by maintaining full capacity of its trucks as well as implementing different loading
   techniques such as loose loading and
 the infrastructure project which aims to identify the optimal local configuration of depots leading to
   the lowest overall costs and minimal co2e impact of the total supply chain

air
tnt aims to constantly improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft operations by applying best practices in
network and flight planning takeoff inflight procedures and ground processes in 2014 tnt rolled out
paperless cockpits across its worldwide fleet of 54 aircraft following approval from the belgian civil
aviation authority to use ipad air tablets as electronic flight bags

in 2014 tnt increased its capacity utilisation on its european air network resulting in a significant
reduction in co2etonneskm through better planning load quality and daily monitoring of load factors
this initiative will continue in 2015

in the years leading up to 2017 a significant number of short haul aircraft will be replaced by younger
more fuelefficient aircraft types

supply chain and innovation platforms
                                                                                            th

emission solutions for deliveries to city centres in the frevue programme tnt has committed to
partner with the cities of amsterdam madrid and rotterdam in the deployment of electric freight
vehicles

tnt is also cofounder of the green freight europe gfe sector initiative which aims amongst others
to reduce carbon emissions of the transportation sector by supporting its members through a standard
methodology for monitoring and reporting on carbon emissions in 2014 tnt was awarded with the first
green freight europe leaf an award that recognises tnts commitment to report and reduce co2e
emissions from freight transport

customers
tnts co2 services enable customers to proactively address the environmental impact of their
business tnts portfolio of co2 services include
 co2 report tracks and analyses co2 footprint
 co2 neutral mitigates the co2 impact of consignments
 co2 quote predicts future co2 emissions
 co2 scenario models and optimises co2 emissions in the transport supply chain

in 2014 tnt extended its portfolio of co2 services these services will be rolled out in key european
countries in january 2015 as part of its extended offering tnt launched co2 neutral domestic
express delivery in germany at no additional charge

people
driver behaviour has a major impact on vehicle fuel efficiency therefore tnts drivers are trained in
driving behaviour which helps to improve fuel efficiency and safety ecodriving is included as a
standard requirement in driving courses in various locations and is also offered to subcontractors where
                            th
possible in 2014 the 8 drive me challenge edition was held at millbrook proving ground in
bedfordshire england tnts drivers and subcontractors from operating units worldwide competed in
fuel efficiency safety and customer experience

outlook and commitments

in the coming years tnt will continue to work on the evolvement of its methodology and process of
recording monitoring and reporting co2 efficiency information and will strive to unify the customer
management and investor disclosure

in 2015 tnt will further refine its reporting and continue to rollout its extended co2 services in
addition tnt will launch programmes to educate operational management on the process of effectively
managing and reducing environmental emissions

tnts current efficiency indicator for vehicles co2e per kilometre does not reflect all improvement
efforts such as improved network optimisation and positive changes in capacity load factors and
excludes subcontractor performance

in 2014 tnt initiated a project in operational excellence to increase efficiency and productivity in its
operations and developed a new co2e efficiency kpi to
 gain additional insight for operational management for strategic purposes and daytoday operations
 comply with new industry standards on reporting tnts footprint
 embed environmental considerations in all operational and network optimisation initiatives and
 serve all customers investors and management information needs through a unified disclosure
    system

as a result in 2015 tnt will amend its efficiency indicator to the number of kilogrammes of co2e that is
emitted to transport one metric tonne 1000 kg of cargo over a distance of one kilometre kg
co2etonneskm to incorporate load factors the revised kpi will allow monitoring of co2e efficiency
against previous years and has been added to the performance management framework for senior
management

the project will enable publication of the co2e efficiency performance for all tnts activities including
subcontractors in the 2015 annual report

internal control
the executive board used elements of former obligations under the sarbanesoxley act in establishing
the companys governance and internal controls over financial reporting icfr furthermore the icfr
framework established by the executive board has a wider scope than would be mandatory according to
the sarbanesoxley act as it includes a number of smaller entities

in addition the approach is based on the principles outlined in auditing standards as 2 and takes into
account certain elements of the as 5 as promulgated by the public companies accounting oversight
board pcaob however tnts approach to icfr does not imply an assessment of the adequacy and
effectiveness of tnts internal control and risk management processes over financial reporting under
section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act nor is there an assessment by tnts external auditor to that
effect

throughout 2014 tnt documented and evaluated the design of icfr in addition tnt continued a
comprehensive programme of testing the operational effectiveness of its icfr further initiatives on
entitylevel controls were undertaken including integrity awareness and training and reinforcement of
policies and procedures the findings identified by each of the entities included in the icfr programme
including the findings raised by the external auditor were reported to the executive board and the audit
committee of the supervisory board

dutch corporate governance code

by applying the best practice provisions and explaining deviations tnt complies with the dutch
corporate governance code an explanation is given below for those instances in which tnt does not
fully comply with the best practice provisions of the code the full text of the code and tnts articles of
association and other relevant internal regulations can be viewed in the corporate governance section
on tnts corporate website wwwtntcomcorporate

best practice provision ii28
this provision stipulates that the remuneration of a member of the board of management in the event of
dismissal may not exceed one years compensation the fixed remuneration component or if the one
years compensation would be manifestly unreasonable in case of a dismissal during the first term of
office a maximum of twice the annual compensation tnt deviates from this best practice by awarding
the current members of the executive board a severance payment in case of a change of control
equalling the sum of the last annual base compensation and pension contribution plus the average
bonus received over the last three years multiplied by a maximum of two tnt believes that such
payment is reasonable taking into account the special position of members of the executive board in a
change of control situation also in such an event the supervisory board may decide that performance
shares vest in whole or in part

best practice provision iv11
this provision stipulates that a companys general meeting may pass a resolution to set aside the
binding nature of a nomination for the appointment of a member of the board of management or of the
supervisory board andor a resolution to remove a member of the board of management or of the
supervisory board by an absolute majority of the votes cast which majority may be required to represent
a proportion of the issued capital which proportion may not exceed onethird if this proportion of the
capital is not represented at the meeting but an absolute majority is in favour of any such resolution a
new meeting may be convened at which the resolution may be passed by an absolute majority of the
votes cast regardless of the proportion of the capital represented at the meeting

tnt applies this best practice provision except for a minor deviation for a resolution to appoint a
member of the executive board or of the supervisory board other than in accordance with a nomination
by the supervisory board there is no second meeting allowed in which the requirement of onethird of
the capital can be set aside tnt deviates from this best practice provision for reasons of stability and
continuity

foundation

stichting continuïteit tnt express the foundation was established to promote the interests of tnt
the enterprise affiliated with tnt and all stakeholders involved these objects include protecting tnt as
much as possible from influences that are contrary to those interests and could jeopardise the
continuity independence or identity of those interests the foundation must endeavour to achieve these
objects by acquiring and holding preference shares and by exercising the rights attached to those
preference shares the objects of the foundation do not entail the sale or encumbrance or other
disposal of shares with the exception of the sale to tnt or to another company assigned by and
affiliated in a group with it as well as the assistance in the repayment or withdrawal of preference
shares

the foundation is an independent legal entity in the sense of section 571 paragraph 1 sub c of the
dutch financial markets supervision act

to enable the foundation to perform its duties tnt has granted it a call option when exercising the
call option the foundation is entitled to subscribe to preference shares consisting of the right to
repeatedly subscribe for preference shares up to a maximum corresponding with one hundred percent
100 of the issued share capital in the form of ordinary shares as outstanding immediately prior to the
exercise of the subscribed rights less one preference share and minus any shares already held by the
foundation the foundation has the right to exercise the call option at any time either wholly or partly

the foundation may exercise the call option for certain reasons including
 to prevent slow down or otherwise complicate an unsolicited takeover bid for and an unsolicited
    acquisition of ordinary shares by means of an acquisition at the stock market or otherwise
 to prevent and countervail concentration of voting rights in the general meeting of stakeholders and
 to resist unwanted influence by and pressure from shareholders to amend the strategy of tnt
and with respect to the foregoing to give tnt the opportunity to consider and to explore possible
alternatives and if required to work these out and to implement them in the event an actual or
threatening concentration of voting rights arises among the shareholders which according to the
provisional judgment of the executive board and the supervisory board and the board of the
foundation is considered to be unsolicited and not in the interest of tnt and its enterprise and to
enable tnt to do so by temporarily neutralising such concentration of voting rights

as from six months after the issuance of the preference shares to the foundation the foundation may
require tnt to convene a general meeting of stakeholders to propose cancellation of the preference
shares against repayment of the paid amount if preference shares are issued tnt must convene a
general meeting of stakeholders to be held no later than 12 months after the date on which the
preference shares were issued for the first time or 60 days after the foundation has demanded the
cancellation of its preference shares the agenda for that meeting of stakeholders must include a
proposal for a resolution relating to the repurchase or cancellation of the preference shares

tnt has granted the foundation the right to file an application for an inquiry into the policy and the
course of events of tnt with the enterprise chamber of the amsterdam court of appeal
ondernemingskamer tnt believes that this may be a useful option amongst others in the period
before the issuance of preference shares as it does not cause a dilution of the rights of other
shareholders to enable the foundation to function properly the executive board holds meetings with
the board of the foundation on a regular basis

the members of the board of the foundation are mr bouw chairman mr tiemstra and ms tonkens

chapter 4

    the performance schedule sliding scale is designed such that a tsr performance of the company
    at index level 0 difference leads to a vesting of half of the maximum of granted rights to shares
   50 nonfinancial targets consisting of targets considered most relevant for the company during
    the threeyear vesting period

the maximum number of shares that can vest under the plan amounts to 100 of the base allocation

the remuneration committee advises the supervisory board on the actual number of performance
shares that vest which will be determined by the tsr performance over the threeyear vesting period
and the performance on the nonfinancial targets over three calendar years preceding the vesting date

base compensation
the remuneration policy for members of the executive board permits the base compensation to be
adjusted in line with the average increase in the collective labour agreements adopted by the larger tnt
entities in europe although the developments in the collective labour agreements allowed for an
increase of the base compensation the supervisory board decided that the annual base compensation
for members of the executive board remained unchanged the base compensation of members of the
executive board has remained unchanged since 2011

the 2014 annual base fee for mr gunning was 750000 and the annual base fee for mr de vries

 70 company results
 30 net cash flow

objectives and determined that the targets were not met therefore no shortterm incentive payout will
occur

bonusmatching plan
in 2014 due to the fact that both mr gunning and mr bot fully waived their 2013 shortterm incentive
entitlements they were not eligible to participate in the bonusmatching plan

longterm incentive

executive board under the tnt performance share plan

depends on the performance of the following performance measures
 50 financial target for further information refer to the remuneration policy above
 50 nonfinancial targets for 2014 a customer satisfaction target

the supervisory board has assessed the performance on the nonfinancial target and determined that
performance exceeded the set target level

2014 award of performance shares has been prorated 94 for his time in service during the three
years vesting period 29 april 2014  1 may 2017 this grant took place on 28 october 2014

v risk management
doing business inherently involves taking risks by managing these risks tnt strives to secure a
sustainable performance therefore tnt operates a risk management framework that allows
management to tolerate risks in a controlled manner which is an essential element of its corporate
governance and strategy development

the executive board supported by senior management and dedicated risk management employees is
responsible for identifying prioritising and mitigating risks and for the establishment and maintenance of
a robust risk management system

risk management framework

tnt has embedded the committee of sponsoring organisations of the treadway commission coso
enterprise risk management erm  integrated framework 2004 as the foundation of its risk
management framework through the companys risk management framework and control systems as
described in section iii the executive board aims to provide reasonable assurance that strategic and
business objectives can be achieved the executive board reviews the risk management framework
and the companys main risks on a regular basis for those risks deemed to be material comprehensive
mitigating action plans are developed and reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that these are
relevant and sufficient at least annually the executive board discusses its risk management framework
and company risks with the audit committee and the supervisory board as well as with the external
auditor

risk appetite
the executive board formalised the risk appetite of tnt using the cosoerm risk categories and
determined that the risk appetite varies between zero and moderate depending on the risk category

board used the outcome of all risk assessments representing input from members of the management
board all functional areas entities and key strategic projects

risk factors
this section describes the main risks facing the execution of tnts strategy as outlined in section iv of
chapter 1 risks have been classified by the cosoerm risk categories and divided into specific and
inherent risks specific risks are risks that the executive board believes could negatively impact short
term to mediumterm objectives inherent risks are risks that are constantly present in the business
environment and are considered sufficiently material to require disclosure and management

summary of significant accounting policies

the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements
are set out below these policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless
otherwise stated all amounts included in the financial statements are presented in euro unless
otherwise stated

basis of preparation
the consolidated financial statements of tnt have been prepared in accordance with international
financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the european union ifrs includes the
application of international financial reporting standards and international accounting standards ias
related interpretations of the international financial reporting interpretations committee ifric and
interpretations of the standing interpretations committee sic the consolidated financial statements
have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for financial instruments and assets
held for disposal




                                                                                                        73

chapter 5

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates it also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying
tnts accounting policies the areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed
in the critical accounting estimates and judgments in applying tnts accounting policies section

the international accounting standards board iasb has issued certain international financial
reporting standards or amendments thereon and the ifric has issued certain interpretations the
impact of changes when adopted by the european union on tnts consolidated financial statements
has been assessed

changes in accounting policies and disclosures

in brazil the social integration programa de integração social pis and the social contribution on
billing contribuição para o financiamento da seguridade social cofins programmes levy taxes
which are highly regulated and represent a significant share of the overall brazilian tax collection

pis is conceived as a means to share the business profits with employees through a mandatory
national savings programme financed by monthly deposits collected as a percentage on the gross
sales cofins was created to finance special social programmes enforced by the federal government
through the collection of a social contribution as a percentage of revenues

previously in the absence of clear guidance under ifrs tnt had accounted for these taxes as taxes
on profit since and although the tax is levied as a percentage of revenues certain cost credits are to be
taken into account to arrive at the taxes due

however it is now more customary to account for the piscofins taxes as an adjustment of revenue
and affected cost as a result tnt has decided to change its accounting for the piscofins since
such a change will result in the financial statements providing more reliable and relevant information
about the effects of its financial performance

the impact on the 2014 reported figures of this change results in 33 million lower revenue 17 million
lower operating income and 17 million lower income tax with no impact on the profit for the period nor
the equity position of the group

a new and amended standards adopted by tnt

   ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements builds on existing principles by identifying the concept
    of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated
    financial statements of the parent company the standard provides additional guidance to assist in
    the determination of control where this is difficult to assess as of 1 january 2014 tnt has adopted
    ifrs 10 this did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements

   ifrs 11 joint arrangements replaces ias 31 interests in joint ventures and deals with how a
    joint arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control should be classified under ifrs
    11 joint ventures are required to be accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereas
    under ias 31 jointly controlled entities can be accounted for using either the equity method of
    accounting or proportionate consolidation method as of 1 january 2014 tnt has adopted ifrs 11
    the impact is disclosed in the paragraph hereafter

   ifrs 12 disclosures of interests in other entities includes the disclosure requirements for all
    forms of interests in other entities including joint arrangements associates special purpose entities
    and other offbalance sheet vehicles as of 1 january 2014 tnt has adopted ifrs 12 this did not
    have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements

b new standards amendments and interpretations not yet adopted

a number of new standards amendments and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective
for the financial year beginning 1 january 2014 and are not early adopted by tnt the items applicable
are presented below

   ifrs 9 financial instruments addresses the classification measurement and recognition of
    financial assets and financial liabilities the complete version of ifrs 9 was issued in july 2014 it
    replaces the guidance in ias 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial
    instruments ifrs 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three
    primary measurement categories for financial assets amortised cost fair value through other
    comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss the basis of classification depends on




                                                                                                         74

statements
chapter 5

    the entitys business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset
    investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss
    with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive
    income not recycling there is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred
    loss impairment model used in ias 39 for financial liabilities there were no changes to classification
    and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive
    income for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss ifrs 9 relaxes the requirements
    for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests it requires an
    economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the hedged ratio to
    be the same as the one management actually uses for risk management purposes
    contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under ias
    39 the standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018 early
    adoption is permitted tnt is yet to assess ifrs 9s full impact

there are no other ifrs or ifric interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to
have a material impact on the group

adoption of ifrs 11
tnt has joint control over the following entities

   tnt swiss post ag
   tnt express luxembourg sa
   png air charter services limited and
   xair services nvsa

these investments have been classified as joint ventures under ifrs 11 and therefore the equity
method of accounting has been used in the consolidated financial statements prior to the adoption of
ifrs 11 tnt applied proportionate consolidation and recognised its investment in the joint ventures at
the beginning of the earliest period presented 1 january 2013 as the total of the carrying amounts of
the assets and liabilities previously proportionately consolidated by the group upon transition to the
equity method of accounting this is the deemed cost of the groups investment in the joint ventures

the effect of this change is shown in the following tables there is no impact on equity comprehensive
income net result and earnings per share




                                                                                                         75

been prepared in accordance with the provisions of article 379 1 and article 414 of book 2 of the dutch
civil code

as the financial statements of tnt express nv are included in the consolidated financial statements
the corporate income statement is presented in an abridged form article 402 of book 2 of the dutch
civil code

subsidiaries associates and joint ventures
subsidiaries are all entities including structured entities over which tnt has control tnt controls an
entity when it is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity subsidiaries are fully consolidated
from the date on which control is transferred to tnt they are deconsolidated from the date that control
ceases
an associate is an entity that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture over which
commercial and financial policy decisions tnt has significant influence significant influence is the
power to participate in financial and operating policy decisions of an entity but is not control or joint
control over those policies tnts share of results of all significant associates is included in the income
statement using the equity method the carrying value of tnts share in associates includes goodwill
on acquisition and changes to reflect tnts share in net earnings of the respective companies reduced
by dividends received tnts share in nondistributed earnings of associates is included in net
investment when tnts share of any accumulated losses exceeds the acquisition value of the shares
in the associates the book value is reduced to zero and the reporting of losses ceases unless tnt is
bound by guarantees or other undertakings in relation to the associate

a joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby tnt and one or more other parties undertake an
economic activity subject to joint control joint ventures in which tnt participates with other parties are
accounted for in the same manner as associates using the equity method

business combinations
tnt applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations the consideration transferred
for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred the liabilities incurred to the
former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group the consideration
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement identfiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date
the group recognises any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree on an acquisitionbyacquisition basis
either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts of
the acquirees identifiable net assets
acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred

if the business combination is achieved in stages the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date any
gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss

any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition
date subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an
asset or liability is recognised in accordance with ias 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other
comprehensive income contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and its
subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity

the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of tnts share of the identifiable net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded as goodwill if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of
tnts share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised directly in the
income statement

tnt treats transactions with noncontrolling interests as transactions with equity owners for purchases
from noncontrolling interests the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share
acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity gains or losses on
disposals to noncontrolling interests are also recorded in equity

when tnt ceases to have control or significant influence any retained interest in the entity is
remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in income statement the
fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the retained
interest as an associate joint venture or financial asset in addition any amounts previously recognised
in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if tnt had directly




                                                                                                             79

disposed of the related assets or liabilities this could lead to a reclassification of amounts previously
recognised in other comprehensive income to the income statement

losses applicable to the noncontrolling interest in excess of its share of the subsidiarys equity are
allocated against tnts interests except to the extent that the noncontrolling interest has a binding
obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses subsidiaries accounting
policies have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with tnts accounting policies

functional currency and presentation currency
items included in the financial statements of all tnts entities are measured using the currency of the
primary environment in which the entity operates the functional currency the consolidated financial
statements are presented in euro which is the functional and presentation currency of tnt

foreign currency transactions and balances
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the date of the transactions monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are
translated to the functional currency using yearend exchange rates

foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency
transactions and balances and from the translation at yearend exchange rates are recognised in the
income statement except for qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges that are
directly recognised in equity

foreign operations
the results and financial position of all tnt entities none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy with a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows

   assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate
   income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates and
   the resulting exchange differences based on the different ways of translation between the statement
    of financial position and the income statement are recognised as a separate component of equity
    translation reserve

foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign
entities and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments
are recognised in the translation reserve when a foreign operation is sold such exchange differences
are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on the sale

goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing exchange rate

intangible assets

goodwill
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the share of the
identifiable net assets acquired by tnt goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible
assets goodwill on acquisition of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of
investments in associates

goodwill is recognised as an asset and although it is not amortised it is reviewed for impairment
annually and whenever there is a possible indicator of impairment any impairment is recognised
immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed goodwill is carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses on disposal of an entity any residual amount of goodwill is included in
the determination of the profit or loss on disposal

goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to ifrs has been retained at the previous
historical values as no adjustment was required on transition these have also been subject to
impairment tests at that date and will continue to be at least annually




                                                                                                        80

other intangible assets
costs related to the development and installation of software for internal use are capitalised at historical
cost and amortised using the straightline method over the estimated useful life apart from software
other intangible assets mainly include customer relationships assets under development licences and
concessions other intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at
the acquisition date

an asset under development is reclassified when it is ready for use and is subsequently amortised using
the straightline method over its estimated useful life other intangible assets are valued at the lower of
historical cost less amortisation and impairment

property plant and equipment
property plant and equipment are valued at historical cost using a component approach less
depreciation and impairment losses in addition to the costs of acquisition the company also includes
costs of bringing the asset to its working condition handling and installation costs and the non
refundable purchase taxes under the component approach each component of an item of property
plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item shall be
depreciated separately

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method based on the estimated useful life taking into
account any residual value the assets residual value and useful life is reviewed and adjusted if
appropriate at each balance sheet date subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount
or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably

land is not depreciated system software is capitalised and amortised as a part of the tangible asset for
which it was acquired to operate because the estimated useful life is inextricably linked to the estimated
useful life of the associated asset

leases of property plant and equipment are classified as finance leases if the company bears
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership finance leases are capitalised at the leases
inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum
lease payments the corresponding rental obligations net of finance charges are included in longterm
debt property plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of
the assets useful life and the lease term

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment

goodwill
goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an
indication that the asset might be impaired

for the purposes of assessing impairment assets are grouped by cashgenerating unit cgu the
lowest level at which there are separately identifiable cash flows for impairment testing of goodwill the
group of cgus is defined as the lowest level where goodwill is monitored for internal purposes this
level may be higher than the level used for testing other assets but is not at a higher level than an
operating segment

if the recoverable value of the cgu is less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the
unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit the recoverable amount is the
higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use in assessing the value in use the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the asset specific risks for the purpose of
assessing impairment corporate assets are allocated to specific cgus before impairment testing the
allocation of corporate assets is based on the contribution of those assets to the future cash flows of the
cgu under review goodwill following the acquisition of associates and joint ventures is not separately
recognised or tested for impairment

impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in a subsequent period

finitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment
at each balance sheet date tnt reviews the carrying amount of its finitelived intangible assets and
property plant and equipment to determine whether there is an indication that those assets have
suffered an impairment loss if any indication exists the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated




                                                                                                         81

statements
chapter 5

in order to determine the extent if any of the impairment loss an asset is impaired if the recoverable
amount is lower than the carrying value the recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an assets
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use

if the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying
amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount any impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the income statement impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed
only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount
since the last impairment loss was recognised the recoverable amount shall not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years a
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement

financial assets and liabilities
tnt classifies financial assets and liabilities into the following categories
 financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
 loans and receivables
 heldtomaturity investments
 availableforsale financial assets and
 financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

the classification depends on the purpose for which the financial asset or liability was acquired
management determines the classification of tnts financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition

financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include derivatives and other
assets and liabilities that are designated as such upon initial recognition

measurement at fair value requires disclosure of measurement methods based on the following fair
value measurement hierarchy
 level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets
 level 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly prices or indirectly
    derived from prices
 level 3 inputs not based on observable market data

financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are initially recorded at fair
value and subsequently remeasured at fair value in the statement of financial position tnt designates
certain derivatives as hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities of a firm commitment
fair value hedge hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecasted transaction cash flow hedge or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
net investment hedge

if a derivative is designated as a cash flow or net investment hedge changes in its fair value are
considered to be effective and recorded in a separate component of equity hedge reserve until the
hedged item is recorded in income any portion of a change in the fair value of a derivative that is
considered to be ineffective or is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness is immediately
recorded in the income statement

at the inception of the transaction tnt documents the relationship between hedging instruments and
hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions the company also documents the assessment both at hedge inception and on an ongoing
basis of whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes
in fair values or cash flows of hedged items

changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are
recorded in the income statement together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or
liability that are attributable to the hedged risk

unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities
classified at fair value through profit or loss are directly recorded in the income statement

amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged
item will affect the income statement for example when the forecasted sale that is hedged takes place
however when the forecasted transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a nonfinancial
asset the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the
initial measurement of the asset or liability




                                                                                                           82

statements
chapter 5

when a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting any cumulative gains or losses existing in equity at that time remain in equity until the
forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement when a forecasted transaction
is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gains or losses that were reported in equity are
immediately transferred to the income statement

loans and receivables
loans granted and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market and for which tnt has no intention of trading loans and
receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the statement of financial position except for
maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date these are classified as noncurrent
assets

loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method

heldtomaturity investments
heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
and fixed maturities where tnt has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity

heldtomaturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method

availableforsale financial assets
availableforsale financial assets are nonderivative financial assets that are either designated in this
category or not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets they are included in non
current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance
sheet date

availableforsale financial assets are carried at fair value unrealised gains and losses arising from
changes in the fair value of financial assets classified as available for sale are recognised in other
comprehensive income when financial assets classified as available for sale are sold or impaired the
accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as a gain or a loss

the fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices if the market for a financial asset
is not active and for unlisted securities tnt establishes fair value by using valuation techniques
these include the use of recent armslength transactions reference to other instruments that are
substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis refined to reflect the issuers specific
circumstances

financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction
costs incurred and are subsequently stated at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net
of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of
the financial liability using the effective interest method

impairment of financial assets
tnt assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a
group of financial assets is impaired in the case of equity securities classified as availableforsale a
significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in
determining whether the securities are impaired if any such evidence exists for availableforsale
financial assets the cumulative loss  measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the
current fair value less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in income
statement  is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement impairment losses on
equity instruments recognised in the income statement are not reversed through equity

inventory
inventories of raw materials and finished goods are valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable
value historical cost is based on weighted average prices

accounts receivable
accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method less allowance for doubtful debt an allowance for doubtful debt is
established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts
due according to the original terms of the receivables the amount of the allowance is the difference

between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted
at the effective interest rate the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement any reversal
of the impairment loss is included in the income statement at the same line as where the original
expense has been recorded

the risk of uncollectibility of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with
and the past due status of doubtful debtors while large accounts are assessed individually based on
factors that include ability to pay bankruptcy and payment history in addition debtors in certain
countries are subject to a higher collectability risk which is taken into account when assessing the
overall risk of uncollectability the assumptions and estimates applied for determining the valuation
allowance are reviewed periodically

cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value cash and cash
equivalents include cash at hand bank account balances bills of exchange and cheques only those
which can be cashed in the short term all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents bank overdrafts are not
netted off from cash and cash equivalents

assets or disposal groups held for disposal and discontinued operations
assets or disposal groups held for disposal are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair
value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is recovered principally by means of disposal rather than
through continuing use assets held for disposal are no longer amortised or depreciated from the time
they are classified as such

assets held for disposal are available for immediate disposal in its present condition and are considered
as highly probable

operations that represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or that
are part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical
area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale and either have been
disposed of or have been classified as held for disposal are presented as discontinued operations in
tnts financial statements

equity
ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares or options are presented in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds

where any group company purchases tnts equity share capital treasury shares the consideration
paid including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity
until the shares are cancelled reissued or disposed of where such shares are subsequently sold or re
issued any consideration received net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the
related income tax effects are included in equity

provisions for pension liabilities
the obligation for all pension and other postemployment benefit plans that qualify as defined benefit
plans is determined by calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and deducting the
fair value of the plan assets tnt uses actuarial calculations projected unit credit method to measure
the obligations and the costs for the calculations actuarial assumptions are made about demographic
variables such as employee turnover mortality and disability and financial variables the discount rate
is determined by reference to highquality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in
which the benefits will be paid

actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions
are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise

pastservice costs if any are recognised immediately in the income statement

gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised at the date of
the curtailment or settlement

pension costs for defined contribution plans are expensed in the income statement when incurred or
due




                                                                                                        84

other provisions
provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event it is probable
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation provisions are measured at the present
value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the
balance sheet date the discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability the gross up of the
provision following the discounting of the provision is recorded in the income statement as interest
expense

provisions are recorded for employee benefit obligations restructuring onerous contracts and other
obligations

provisions for employee benefit obligations include longservice leave or sabbatical leave jubilee or
other longservice benefits longterm disability benefits and if they are not payable wholly within 12
months after the end of the period profitsharing bonuses and deferred compensation the expected
costs of these benefits are recognised over the period of employment actuarial gains and losses and
changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to income in the period in which such gain or
loss occurs related service costs are recognised immediately

provisions recorded for restructuring largely relate to termination benefits termination benefits are
payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits tnt recognises termination benefits
when the company has committed to terminate the employment of current employees according to a
detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or to provide termination benefits as a result of an
offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy benefits falling due more than 12 months after balance
sheet date are discounted to their present value

provisions for onerous contracts are recorded when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation
under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to arise from that contract taking into
account impairment of tangible assets first

the provision for other obligations relates to legal and contractual obligations and received claims

established by the taxation authorities based on which income taxes are payable or recoverable

deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and the tax base of assets and liabilities are calculated using the substantively
enacted tax rates expected to apply when they are realised or settled deferred tax assets are
recognised if it is probable that they will be realised deferred tax assets and liabilities where a legally
enforceable right to offset exists and within the same tax group are presented net in the statement of
financial position

revenue recognition
revenue is recognised when services are rendered goods are delivered or work is completed revenue
is the gross inflow of economic benefits during the current year that arise from ordinary activities and
result in an increase in equity other than increases relating to contributions from equity participants

 the company has transferred to a buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
    and services
 the company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
    with ownership nor effective control of the goods and services sold
 the amount of revenue can be measured reliably
 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the company
 the costs to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and




                                                                                                         85

and when a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made

sharebased payments
sharebased payment transactions are transactions in which tnt receives benefits from its employees
in consideration for equity instruments or for amounts of cash that are based on the price of equity
instruments of the company the fair value of the equitysettled sharebased transactions is recognised
as an expense part of the employee costs and a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting
period the fair value of payments of sharebased payment plans based on market conditions is
calculated using the monte carlo model the fair value of payments of sharebasement plans based on
nonmarket conditions are based on the share price on the date the grant is made corrected for a
dividend yield the equity instruments granted do not vest until the employee completes a specific
period of service

interest income and expense
interest income and expense are recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest
method interest income comprises interest income on lendings changes in the fair value of financial
assets at fair value through profit or loss foreign currency gains and gains on hedged items interest

taxation on profits are included in cash flows from operating activities interest payments are included in
cash flows from operating activities while interest receipts are included in cash flows from investing
activities the cost of acquisition of subsidiaries associates and investments insofar as it was paid for
in cash is included in cash flows from investing activities acquisitions of subsidiaries are presented net
of cash balances acquired cash flows from derivatives are recognised in the consolidated statement of
cash flows in the same category as those of the hedged item

critical accounting               estimates         and     judgments in            applying        tnts
accounting policies

the preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments estimates and
assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets
liabilities income and expenses actual results may differ from these estimates estimates and
judgments are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected
the critical accounting estimates judgments and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are
discussed below

business combinations
tnt accounts for all its business combinations applying the acquisition method the assets acquired
and the liabilities assumed are recognised and measured on the basis of their fair values at the date of
acquisition to determine fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed tnt must make
estimates and use valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available any excess of the
cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired represents goodwill

for purposes of preparation of the consolidated financial statements internal reorganisations or transfer
of businesses between tnt companies were accounted for at predecessor carrying amounts these
transactions did not give rise to goodwill

segment reporting
tnt reports separate information about each operating segment or results from aggregating two or
more operating segments that meet the criteria of similar economic characteristics consistent with the
core principle of ifrs when operating segments are similar in respect of
 the nature of products and services
 the nature of the production process
 the type or class of customers for their products and services
 the method used to distribute their products or provide their services and
 if applicable the nature of the regulatory environment

operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decisionmaker function the chief operating decisionmaker function is performed by the
management board whom receives operational and financial information on a monthly basis for the

impairment of assets
in determining impairments of intangible assets including goodwill property plant and equipment and
financial fixed assets management must make significant judgments and estimates to determine
whether the fair value of the cash flows generated by those assets is less than their carrying value
determining cash flows requires the use of judgments and estimates that have been included in the
strategic plans and longrange forecasts of tnt the data necessary for executing the impairment tests
are based on management estimates of future cash flows which require estimating revenue growth
rates and profit margins refer to note 1 for applied sensitivities on intangible assets

depreciation and amortisation of property plant and equipment and intangible assets
property plant and equipment and intangible assets except for goodwill are depreciated or amortised
at historical cost using a straightline method based on the estimated useful life taking into account any
residual value the assets residual value and useful life are based on tnts best estimates and are
reviewed and adjusted if required at each balance sheet date

impairment of receivables
the risk of uncollectability of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with
and the past due status of doubtful debtors while large accounts are individually assessed based on
factors that include ability to pay bankruptcy and payment history in addition debtors in certain
countries are subject to a higher collectability risk which is taken into account when assessing the
overall risk of uncollectability should the outcome differ from the assumptions and estimates revisions
to the estimated valuation allowances would be required

restructuring
restructuring charges mainly result from restructuring operations including combinations andor
relocations of operations changes in tnts strategic direction or managerial responses to declining
demand increasing costs or other market factors restructuring provisions reflect many estimates
including those pertaining to separation costs reduction of excess facilities contract settlements and
tangible asset impairments actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these
estimates

income taxes
the company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions significant judgment is required in
determining the worldwide provision and liability for income taxes there are many transactions and
calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business
tnt recognises liabilities for tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due
based on its best interpretation of the relevant tax laws and rules where the final tax outcome of these
matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will impact the income
tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made

tnt recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow
the deferred tax asset to be recovered this is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in
which the company operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable in the
event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods and depending on the tax
strategies that the company may be able to implement changes to the recognition of deferred tax
assets could be required which could impact tnts financial position and net profit

accounting for assets held for disposal
accounting for assets held for disposal requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates such
as the assumptions used in fair value calculations as well as the estimated costs to dispose

pension benefits
the present value of the pension obligation depends on a number of factors that are determined on an
actuarial basis using a number of assumptions any change in these assumptions will impact the
carrying amount of pension obligations the assumptions used in determining the net pension
expenseincome include the discount rate which is based on the longterm yield of highquality
corporate bonds other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market
conditions tnt reviews the assumptions at the end of each year refer to note 10 for more information

contingent liabilities
legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending against the company in various jurisdictions
due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters it is often difficult to predict the final outcome cases
and claims against the company often raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues that are
subject to many uncertainties and complexities including but not limited to the facts and circumstances
of each particular case and claim the jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law in the normal
course of business tnt consults with legal counsel and certain other experts on matters related to
litigations

tnt accrues a liability when it is determined that an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated in the event an adverse outcome is possible or an estimate is not
determinable the matter is disclosed as a contingent liability

goodwill
goodwill is allocated to tnts cgus and tested for impairment the introduction of the revised
management structure that was announced in february 2014 and was implemented in the fourth
quarter resulted in a revised operating segment and subsequently a revised structure of cgus for the
allocation of goodwill

previously the cgus carrying goodwill balances were germany france other europe other south
americas the pacific and amea following the revised organisational structure the cgus for goodwill
impairment testing purposes have changed into germany france domestic nordics eastern europe
south east europe  turkey spain portugal austria chile the pacific and amea the relevant
goodwill was reallocated to the new cgus based on the relative value of the cgus which were part of
the former cgus unless directly allocated to the specific cgu if it originated from a prior acquisition
relating to the cgu

subsequent to the revised allocation of goodwill in 2014 the goodwill balances were tested for
impairment as a result of this test it was concluded that an amount of 32 million of goodwill allocated
to cgu spain was impaired

the total goodwill balance at 31 december 2014 which amounted to 1007 million 2013 1039 was
allocated to germany 161 million france domestic 125 million nordics 53 million eastern
europe 224 million south east europe  turkey 120 million portugal 10 million austria 21
million chile 24 million the pacific 20 million and amea 249 million

chapter 5

the annual goodwill impairment test did not result in additional impairment charges more information is
disclosed in the following sections

goodwill impairment testing
as part of its goodwill impairment test tnt performed a detailed review of the recoverable amount of
each cgu the recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use
fair value less cost to sell represents the best estimate of the amount tnt would receive if it were to
sell the cgu the value in use is estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows the
subsequent impairment test is based on the the value in use

for mature markets the estimated future net cash flows are based on a fiveyear forecast and business
plan for emerging markets where no steady state has been achieved to date a tenyear forecast has
been applied to estimate the future net cash flows the cash flow projections were based on
managements latest estimates

projected gross margins are based on past performance and expectations for market development the
applied growth rates do not exceed the longterm average growth rate of the related operations and
markets and are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports the discount rates used vary
from 73 to 119 posttax 87 to 136 pretax to reflect specific risks relating to each cgu

key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values of all cgus are
 maturity of the underlying market market share and volume development to determine the revenue
   mix and growth rate
 level of capital expenditure in network related assets that may affect the further rollout of the
   network
 level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development taking into account the
   nature of the underlying costs potential economies of scale and
 discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency
   and inflationrelated risks

management has carried out an impairment test and concluded that the recoverable amount based on
value in use of the individual cgus with the exception of cgu spain is higher than the carrying
amount a sensitivity analysis has been applied for all cgus with the exception of cgu spain this
sensitivity analysis included the individual impact of the following items which are considered to be the
most critical when determining the recoverable value
 increase of the discount factor by 1 and 2
 increase of capital expenditure by 5 per year and
 decrease of operating income by 5 per year

based on the impairment test management concluded that the recoverable amount based on value in
use of cgu spain was below the carrying amount as a result of which an impairment has been
recognised for an amount of 32 million

in 2013 management concluded that the recoverable amount based on value in use of the former
cgus southern europe  mea northern europe and other networks was below the carrying amount
for a total amount of 296 million

   goodwill allocated to the former cgu southern europe  mea 571 million was impaired by 159
    million due to weaker performances in france and italy and the higher granularity of the new cgus
    as a result of which compensating developments could no longer be taken into account
   goodwill allocated to the former cgu northern europe 659 million was impaired by 79 million
    as a result of the worsened economic climate and the higher granularity of the new cgus
   goodwill allocated to other networks 58 million was fully impaired as a result of the
    discontinuation of an important fashion contract and the decline in the results of tnt innight
    activities

software and other intangible assets
at 31 december 2014 the software balance of 77 million 2013 81 included internally generated
software with a book value of 57 million 2013 66 the addition to software of 11 million is related to
purchased software an amount of 17 million was reclassified to software related to finalised it
projects

at 31 december 2014 the other intangible assets balance of 33 million 2013 17 is related to
customer relationships of 3 million 2013 5 and software under construction of 30 million 2013 12
the addition to other intangibles of 32 million is mainly related to software development projects




                                                                                                        91

tnts pension expense is affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations
management reviews these and other assumptions every year measurement date for tnts post
employment benefits is 31 december changes in assumptions may occur as a result of economic and
market conditions if actual results differ from those assumed this will generate actuarial gains or
losses

ias 19 employee benefits requires an entity to determine the rates used to discount employee benefit
obligations with reference to market yields on highquality corporate bonds the first step of the process
is to identify a set of bonds that accurately reflects the relationship between yield and remaining time to
maturity for highquality corporate bonds for this tnt uses the iboxx aarated corporate bond
universe using the bond selection regression analysis is used to find the bestfitting curve that states
yieldtomaturity as a function of remaining time to maturity the nelsonsiegel model is applied to fit the
curve towards tnts 30year duration the resulting discount rate per 31 december 2014 was 23
2013 39

the expected return on plan assets equals the used discount rate

the average number of ftes working in tnt during 2014 was 57485 which decreased by 2899
compared to 2013 yeartodate this was mainly due to the impact of the deliver improvement
programme in a number of countries and the sale of tnt fashion bv

the 2013 figures have been restated for comparative purposes the presented figures exclude joint
ventures

the average number of ftes at joint ventures was 652 2013 892 while the number of employees
was 757 2013 994

hereafter relevant incentive schemes and costs recognised for senior management are further
disclosed

senior management
a selected group of senior managers may participate in variable sharebased schemes participation
and application of the variable sharebased schemes for senior management is dependent on the
decision of the executive board the related costs recognised in the income statement for 2014
amounted to 48 million 2013 19

the figures disclosed in the following tables exclude the amounts related to the members of the
executive board which are disclosed in note 19

bonusmatching plan
in 2014 appointed members of a selected group of managers could on a voluntary basis participate in
the bonusmatching plan by investing a maximum of 50 of the gross payout of the shortterm incentive
of the previous year however the investment in tnt shares cannot be more than the net proceeds of
the bonus after a threeyear holding period these shares will be matched on a onetoone basis and
settled in shares

the company sees the bonusmatching plan as part of the remuneration package for the members of its
senior management and it is particularly aimed at further aligning the objectives of senior management
with the interests of shareholders and longterm value creation

grants are made in accordance with the bonusmatching plan which was approved by the supervisory
board for the 2014 grant the matching rights comprise shares in 2011 the matching rights comprised
phantom shares so that after three years in 2014 the rights under this plan were settled in cash

the significant aspects of the bonusmatching plans are
 bonus shares are purchased from the participants net proceeds for the 2014 grant using 25 or
   50 of the gross bonus amount and for the 2011 grant using 25 of the gross bonus amount the
   matching right is granted upon the purchase of the bonus shares
 from the net proceeds the bonus shares are purchased on euronext amsterdam 3 june 2014
   average purchase price of 644share 6 june 2011 average purchase price of 947share
 the rights to phantom shares are granted for zero costs and the number of phantom shares is
   equal to the number of bonus shares matching on a onetoone basis
 after a holding period of three years after the grant the shares are delivered for the 2011 grant the
   value at vesting of the phantom shares is delivered in cash
 for each bonus share that is sold within three years the associated right to one matching phantom
   share lapses if more than 50 of the bonus shares is sold within three years the entire right to
   matching phantom shares lapses with immediate effect
 when a participant leaves the company for certain reasons retirement certain reorganisations
   disability or death the matching right will vest immediately and heshe receives sharescash on a pro
   rata basis
 a participant loses the matching right with immediate effect in case heshe leaves the company for
   reasons other than those mentioned above

in 2012 due to the intended merger with ups there was no grant of bonusmatching shares in 2013
the executive board decided not to provide for a bonusmatching share grant for senior management

oneoff investmentmatching plan
in 2011 prior to the demerger of the express activities in order to align the objectives of members of the
executive board and senior management with longterm value creation and the interests of
shareholders the supervisory board of tnt decided to apply a voluntary oneoff investmentmatching
plan in which the cash proceeds from the unwinding of the tnt bonusmatching plan performance
share plan and option plan could  post demerger  be invested in tnt shares the participants in these
plans could elect to invest from their net proceeds an amount equal to 25 or 50 of their total gross
unwindingrelated sum but not more than the net proceeds thereof in tnt shares on the same date
these shares in the plan called investment shares were purchased the participant received free of
charge a matching right on phantom shares representing the value in cash of half of the number of
investment shares matching on a 1 05 basis this matching right will vest and the cash value of the
phantom shares comprising the matching right will be paid after three years provided that the
participant has remained an employee throughout and still owns at least 50 of hisher investment
shares if prior to vesting the participant sold more than half of hisher investment shares the matching
right will forfeit in full and if the participant sold 50 or fewer of hisher investment shares the number
of phantom shares comprising the matching right will be reduced proportionally

from the cash sum invested the shares are purchased on euronext amsterdam 2 august 2011

performance share plan

2014 grant
on 29 april 2014 the annual grant under the tnt performance share plan occurred for a selected group
of senior managers the maximum number of shares comprised in the share award reflects the position
that the participant holds and managements assessment of hisher future contribution to the company

the performance shares vest after a threeyear period upon continued employment the actual number
of shares that vest depends on the performance of the following performance measures
 50 financial target the total shareholder return tsr performance of the company measured on a
    threeyear basis against a peer group of aex companies 50 weighting and of tnts three main
    direct competitors deutsche post dhl fedex and ups 50 weighting and
 50 nonfinancial target customer satisfaction measured on an annual basis

the actual number of 2014 performance shares that will vest at the vesting date will be determined by
the tsr performance over the period 2014 to 2017 and the performance on the nonfinancial target
over the three calendar years preceding the vesting date

the maximum number of shares that can vest under the plan amounts to 100 of the base allocation

the total costs incurred in 2014 for the 2014 grant amount in total to 2855440 and are based on a
fair value of 481 per share as the average of the fair value of 325 per share for the tsr and 637
per share for the nonfinancial elements these total costs are based on the assumption of a 97
average probability of meeting the nonfinancial targets

the fair value of the 50 tsr portion has been measured using the monte carlo fair value
measurement method the fair value of the 50 nonfinancial portion is derived form the share price on
euronext amsterdam at the grant date 29 april 2014 651 corrected for the dividend yield for the
threeyear vesting period significant assumptions used in the calculations are as follows

2013 grant
the actual number of 2013 performance shares that vest depends on the performance of the following
performance measures
 50 financial target the tsr performance of the company measured on a threeyear basis against
   a peer group of companies full aex and
 50 nonfinancial targets customer employees and sustainability measured on an annual basis

the total costs incurred in 2014 for the 2013 grant amount in total to 1030581 and are based on a
fair value of 449 per share as the average of the fair value of 323 per share for the tsr and 575
per share for the nonfinancial elements these total costs are based on the assumption of a 32
average probability of meeting the nonfinancial targets

2012 compensation grant
due to the intended merger with ups the 2012 grant of performance shares did not take place in 2013
the supervisory board decided to provide for a limited 2012 compensation grant by excluding the 50
grant value related to the tsr performance of the company as a result the grant value of this
compensation grant is only based on the value 50 that in the regular grant is related to the
performance of the company on the nonfinancial targets

for the 2012 compensation grant the following specific rules apply
 the regular threeyear vesting period is shortened to two years
 the actual number of awarded compensation shares is adjusted for the 2012 achievement of the
   nonfinancial targets being 6667 and
 the vesting of the awarded compensation shares is contingent on continued employment at the
   vesting date

for the current members of the executive board due to the performance on the shortterm incentive
targets there is no entitlement to a 2014 shortterm incentive payment

bonusmatching share plan
members of the executive board could on a voluntary basis participate in the bonusmatching plan by
investing a maximum of 50 of the gross payout of the shortterm incentive of the previous year
however the investment in tnt shares cannot be more than the net proceeds of the bonus under the
2014 remuneration policy these shares will be matched on a onetoone basis and settled in shares
after a threeyear holding period

additionally the following applies for the bonusmatching shares granted in 2013 in the event that the
company results target is met every year during the threeyear holding period a maximum additional
match will be made on a onetotwo basis resulting in a total award of three matching shares if the
performance is below the company results target there is no delivery of additional matching shares for
that specific year

the matching of bonus shares occurs under the condition of continued employment and if at least 50
of the bonusmatching shares is retained during the holding period

mr gunning and mr bot decided to fully waive any of their 2013 shortterm incentive entitlements and
as a result there was no grant of bonusmatching shares in 2014

the following table summarises the number of outstanding bonusmatching shares per member of the
executive board

2014 grant
on 29 april 2014 the grant under the tnt performance share plan occurred refer to note 18 for details
of the performance share plan including assumptions used for valuation

the 2014 grant of performance shares for the members of the executive board was based on a value of
50 of their annual base compensation the actual number of rights to shares granted is determined by
dividing the available amount 50 of the annual base compensation by the fair value of the right to a
share according to ifrs

mr de vries joined the company on 1 july 2014 therefore his 2014 award of performance shares has
been prorated 94 for his time in service during the three years vesting period 29 april 2014  1 may
2017 this grant took place on 28 october 2014 the fair value per share amounts to 253 and is
derived from the share price on euronext amsterdam at the grant date 28 october 2014 449
corrected for a dividend yield for the vesting period

2012 compensation grant
due to the intended merger with ups the 2012 grant of performance shares did not take place in 2013
the supervisory board decided to provide for a limited 2012 compensation grant by excluding the grant
value related to the tsr performance of the company 50 weighting the grant value of this
compensation grant was therefore only based on the value that related to the performance of the
company on nonfinancial targets 50 weighting for the 2012 compensation grant specific rules
apply refer to note 18 for more details this resulted in a grant of 10 of the annual base compensation
for each of the members of the executive board 30 annual base compensation x 50 grant value
related to nonfinancial targets x 2012 performance score on nonfinancial targets of 6667 the
actual number of rights to shares granted is determined by dividing the available amount 10 of the
annual base compensation by the fair value of the right to a share according to ifrs

both mr gunning and mr de vries were not eligible for this compensation award since they joined the
company after 2012

notes to the consolidated statement of cash flows

the noncash transactions in the consolidated statement of cash flows relate to depreciation
amortisation and impairment charges sharebased payment expenses results from investments in
associates foreign exchange gains and losses investments in property plant and equipment financed
via finance leases book results on sale of property plant and equipment and changes in provisions

24 net cash from operating activities 106 million 2013 360

impact of depreciation amortisation impairments and sharebased payments

the change in net pension liabilities of 10 million in 2014 2013 7 reflects the total tnt noncash
employer pension expense for the postemployment defined benefit plans of 16 million 2013 29
compared to the total tnt cash contributions to various postemployment defined benefit plans for a
total amount of 34 million 2013 36

in 2014 there was a net cash inflow presented of 89 million in other provisions compared to a net cash
inflow of 58 million in 2013 this was mainly due to the addition to the other provisions of 222 million
mainly restructuring and claims offset by utilisation of the restructuring and other provisions and the
transfer of the provisions related to brazil domestic from liabilities related to assets held for disposal

2013 4 are included for shortterm debt of which 3 million 2013 3 is due to cash pools that are
offset against the interest received and for interest on foreign currency hedges of 11 million 2013 16
and interest paid on taxes of 1 million 2013 1 the decrease in interest on foreign currency hedges
was mainly caused by lower interest rate differentials between currencies in foreign exchange forward
contracts

the interest paid and received on notional cash pools are reported on a gross basis in accordance with
ifrs from an economic and legal perspective the 3 million 2013 3 interest paid fully nets off against
the 6 million 2013 4 interest received the amounts are not netted in the income statement and cash
flow statement because under ifrs such offset needs in practice to be irreversibly exercised from time
to time

similarly the interest paid and received on various foreign currency derivatives have been aggregated
on a gross basis while economically the 3 million of interest received 2013 5 is offset against the
11 million 2013 16 of interest paid on hedges

among other rights and obligations it includes liabilities allocated to tnt as part of the tnt demerger
related to the pension entitlements of beneficiaries in the pension funds who are no longer employed by

pensioners in the event tnt should fail to pay the amounts due under the execution agreements the
pension fund can directly address the companies affiliated to tnt proportionally for those amounts

arrangement between tnt and postnl regarding pensions

   funds is below a certain level the guarantee lapses if the coverage ratio rises above that level and
   remains above that level for three consecutive quarters and

contingent tax liabilities
tnt is exposed to varying degrees of uncertainty related to tax planning and regulatory reviews and
audits tnt accounts for its income taxes on the basis of its own internal analyses supported by
external advice tnt continually monitors its global tax position and whenever uncertainties arise tnt
assesses the potential consequences and either accrues the liability or discloses a contingent liability in
its financial statements depending on the strength of the companys position and the resulting risk of
loss

at yearend 2014 total contingent tax liabilities for uncertainties are assessed to amount to between 70
million and 80 million 2013 between 60 million and 70 million for which tnt based on its own
assessment and supported by external advice has concluded that the likelihood of an outflow of
economic benefits to settle the obligation is not probable

contingent legal liabilities

ordinary course litigation
the company is involved in several legal proceedings relating to the normal conduct of its business
such as claims for loss of goods delays in delivery trademark infringements subcontracting and
employment issues and general liability the majority of these claims are for amounts below 1 million
and are insured andor provided for tnt does not expect any liability arising from any of these legal
proceedings to have a material effect on its results of operations liquidity capital resources or ﬁnancial
position the company believes it has provided for all probable liabilities deriving from the normal course
of business

foreign investigations
tnt announced on 16 july 2014 that it received a statement of objections from the french competition
authority fca with respect to alleged anticompetitive behaviour in the french parcels delivery sector
with regards to tnt france tnt has cooperated with the investigation since it started in 2010 on 24
september 2014 tnt announced that it entered into a settlement with the fca which settlement
includes a reduction percentage to the fine the absolute amount of the fine  as to be determined by
the fca  is not expected before the end of 2015 tnt made a financial provision of 50 million in the
third quarter

tnt has voluntarily disclosed to the united states bureau of industry and security its involvement in re

responded to information requests from competition authorities and cooperated with investigations in
this respect tnt does not currently expect any liability arising from any of the above investigations to
have a material effect on its results of operation liquidity capital resources or financial position

29 financial risk management
no corresponding financial statement number

tnts activities expose the company to a variety of financial risks such as market risks including
foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk all of these risks arise
in the normal course of business to manage market risks tnt uses a variety of financial derivatives

the tables within this note provide quantitative information regarding tnts exposure to the financial
risks mentioned above there are certain limitations and simplifications inherent in the analyses
presented primarily due to the assumption that rates change in a parallel fashion and instantaneously
while at the same time for example the impact of changes in interest on foreign exchange exposures
and vice versa is ignored in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions
that normally would arise from the market shifts assumed

tnt uses derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of hedging exposures the company
enters into contracts related to derivative financial instruments for periods commensurate with its
underlying exposures and does not take positions independent of these exposures none of these
financial instruments are leveraged or used for trading purposes or to take speculative positions

financial risk management is carried out by the tnt treasury department under policies approved by
the executive board the tnt treasury department identifies evaluates and hedges financial risk in
close cooperation with operating units the executive board provides written principles for overall risk
management as well as written policies covering specific areas such as interest rate risk foreign
exchange risk credit risk and liquidity risk periodic reporting on financial risks has been embedded in
the overall risk framework and has been provided to the executive board in a structural way

interest rate risk
part of tnts borrowings and leases are against floating interest rates these floating interest rates may
fluctuate substantially and could have a material adverse effect on tnts financial results in any given
reporting period borrowings that are issued at variable rates expose the company to cash flow volatility
from movements in interest rates borrowings that are issued at fixed rates expose the company to fair
value interest rate risk tnts financial assets are on average of such shortterm nature that they bear
no significant fair value interest rate risk but do cause cash flow interest rate risks group policy is to
significantly limit the impact of interest fluctuations over a term of seven years as a percentage of
earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation at 31 december 2014 tnts gross
interest bearing borrowings including ﬁnance lease obligations totalled 216 million 2013 220 of
which 164 million 2013 161 was at a ﬁxed interest rate

although tnt generally enters into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivatives in order to
attempt to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations these measures may be inadequate or may
subject the company to increased operating or financing costs

at 31 december 2014 if interest rates on borrowings and financial assets had been 1 higher with
other variables held constant the profit before income tax would have been 6 million higher 2013 7
and equity would be impacted by 8 million 2013 10 due to the outstanding interest rate swaps with
a nominal value of us184 million refer to note 30

foreign currency exchange risk
tnt operates on an international basis generating foreign currency exchange risks arising from future
commercial transactions recognised assets and liabilities investments and divestments in foreign
currencies other than the euro tnts functional and reporting currency these significant operational
foreign currency cash flow risks are mostly not hedged tnt treasury department matches and
manages the intragroup and external financial exposures although the company generally enters into
hedging arrangements and other contracts in order to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations
these measures may be inadequate or may subject the company to increased operating or financing
costs

management has set up a policy that requires group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk
against their local functional currency group companies are required to hedge material balance sheet
exposures via the use of foreign exchange derivatives with the tnt treasury department whereby a
financing company operated by the department trades these foreign exchange derivatives with external
banks tnt currently has no net investment hedges outstanding significant acquisitions and local debt
is usually funded in the currency of the underlying assets

credit risk
credit risk represents the loss that the company would incur if counterparties with whom tnt enters into
financial transactions are unable to fulfil the terms of the agreements credit risk arises from cash and
cash equivalents derivatives and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as credit
exposures relating to customers the company attempts to minimise its credit risk exposure by only
transacting with financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines and by managing its
customers portfolio tnt continually monitors the credit standing of financial counterparties and its
customers individual risk limits are set on internal and external ratings in accordance with limits set by
the executive board the utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored at balance sheet date there
were no significant concentrations of credit risk related to customers the top ten customers of tnt
account for 5 of the outstanding trade receivables at 31 december 2014

liquidity risk
prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash the availability of funding through
an adequate amount of undrawn committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions
due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses tnt attempts to maintain flexibility in funding
by keeping committed credit lines available

tnt has central availability to the following undrawn committed facilities

capital structure management
it is the objective of tnt when managing the capital structure to safeguard its ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure tnts capital structure is managed along the following
components
 an investment grade credit rating of bbb by sp and baa1 by moodys
 an availability of at least 400 million to 500 million of undrawn committed facilities
 cash pooling systems facilitating optimised cash requirements for the group and
 a tax optimal internal and external funding focused at optimising the cost of capital for the group
     within longterm sustainable boundaries

tnts credit ratings per 31 december 2014 are bbb stable by sp and baa2 negative by
moodys a downgrade in the credit rating of tnt may negatively affect its ability to obtain funds from
financial institutions retain investors and banks and increase its financing costs by increasing the
interest rates of its outstanding debt or the interest rates at which the company is able to refinance
existing debt or incur new debt this could affect its return for shareholders and benefits to other
stakeholders

the terms and conditions of tnts material shortterm and longterm debts as well as its material
drawn or undrawn committed credit facilities do not include any financial covenants there are also no
possibilities to accelerate these material debts and committed facilities in case of a credit rating
downgrade the debt and credit facility instruments vary on a case by case basis and mostly contain
customary clauses as are generally observed in the market such as negative pledge conditions
restrictions on the use of the proceeds of the sale of assets or businesses and in most cases change
of control clauses

our audit approach

overview
we designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in
the financial statements in particular we looked at where the executive board made subjective
judgements for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain as in all of our audits we also
addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including evaluating whether there was
evidence of bias by the directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud

our engagement consists of certain specified procedures on the second quarter interim financial
statements pre yearend closing procedures in the fourth quarter 2014 and the yearend audit given
the size of the company and its operations we are involved on a continuous basis and have ongoing



                                                                                                       139

materiality
the scope of our audit is influenced by the application of materiality our audit opinion aims on providing
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement
misstatements may arise due to fraud or error they are considered to be material if individually or in
the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
on the basis of the financial statements

we set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality these together with qualitative considerations as
part of our risk analysis helped us to determine the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures
and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion

based on our professional judgment we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole
as follows



overall group materiality                           10 million 2013 10
how we determined it                                5 of adjusted profit before tax this adjustment consists
                                                    of specific nonrecurring items and finance lease expenses
                                                    which are audited in more detail nonrecurring items
                                                    include for example restructuring charges and impairment
                                                    charges
rationale for benchmark applied                     we have applied this benchmark a generally accepted
                                                    auditing practice based on our analysis of the common
                                                    information needs of users of the financial statements on
                                                    this basis we believe that profit before tax is an important
                                                    metric for the financial performance of the company


we also take misstatements andor possible misstatements into account that in our judgment are
material for qualitative reasons




                                                                                                               140

we agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them misstatements in the income
statement identified during our audit exceeding 05 million 2013 05 as well as misstatements below
that amount that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons

the scope of our group audit
tnt express nv is the holding company of a group of entities the financial information of this group is
included in the consolidated financial statements of tnt express nv
when setting the scope of our audit of the group we consider the following key factors in the control
environment
 we rely on the groups internal control on financial reporting icfr framework and the
     monitoring of this framework where relevant we test this framework at the companys head office
     and in some selected countries in order to be able to rely on it
 the majority of the it environment of the group is centralised in the it service centre we test
     these systems and procedures centrally and provide assurance on the central it general controls
     to the component audit teams
 the system for international deliveries is centrally maintained we use the system data as a basis
     for centralised revenue assurance procedures these revenue reports are followed up at the
     component level by component audit teams
 we undertake work and provide an independent assurance report concerning the groups financial
     transfer pricing process which is centrally organised our component audit teams apply the
     findings and gain comfort from this report
 we liaise with the groups internal audit department they perform financial and operational audits
     on a rotational and risk assessment basis in addition to our group audit scope we also selected 4
     smaller entities on a rotational basis as part of our unpredictability procedures these audits are
     performed by internal audit we perform procedures to ensure that we can place sufficient reliance
     on internal audit such as assessing their objectivity and competence their system of quality
     review by providing them specific instructions and reviewing their audit files

taking into account the key factors above we tailor the scope of our audit of the group

how we tailored the scope of our group audit
considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the companys consolidated financial
statements we are responsible for the direction supervision and performance of the group audit in this
context we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the group
to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a
whole determining factors are the geographic structure of the group the significance andor risk profile
of group entities or activities the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which the
group operates on this basis we selected group reporting entities for which an audit of financial
information or specific balances was considered necessary and included tax valuation pension and
share based payments specialists in our group audit team

the group audit is aligned with the divisional structure and strategy of tnt express nv in the
domestics division all countries with the exception of chile have been identified as significant
components being  australia brazil france italy and the united kingdom in addition significant
components have been identified in the international europe division for example germany and the
international amea division for example china in our view due to their significance andor risk
characteristics each of these components required a full scope audit of their financial information we
also included all significant network entities in our group audit scope by performing full scope or
specified audit procedures on european road network it central services eurohub and tnt airways

we issued specific instructions to the audit teams of the components in our audit scope these
instructions included our risk analysis materiality and global audit approach to centralised processes
and systems we determined the level of involvement in the audit work at those entities in order to be
able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our
opinion on the group financial statements as a whole we formally update our component teams three
times during the year via conference calls in which we present recent developments the scope of our
audit audit risks materiality and our global audit approach we also had individual calls with every
component team on three occasions during the year during these calls we discuss the reports of the
component team the findings of their procedures and other matters which could be of relevance for the
group financial statements in addition separate calls were held on an ongoing basis between senior
members of the group audit team and the component auditors during these calls we share local
findings and consider their follow up or the need for support or information from a central level the
group audit team visits a number of the component teams annually in the current year senior members
of the group team visited australia brazil france italy poland spain the uk and the usa our
selection is based on the relative significance of the entities within the group or specific risks identified 




                                                                                                            141

appendix to our auditors report on the 2014 financial statements of
tnt express nv

in addition to what is included in our auditors report we have further set out in this appendix our
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves

the auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

we have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the
audit in accordance with dutch standards on auditing ethical requirements and independence
requirements our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error our audit consisted of
amongst others

    identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether
     due to fraud or error designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks and
     obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion the risk
     of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
     error as fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the
     override of internal control
    obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
     procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an
     opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control
    evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
     estimates and related disclosures made by management
    concluding on the appropriateness of managements use of the going concern basis of accounting
     and based on the audit evidence obtained concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related
     to events and or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entitys ability to continue as a
     going concern if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists we are required to draw attention in
     our auditors report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or if such disclosures are
     inadequate to modify our opinion our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
     the date of our auditors report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial
     statements as a whole however future events or conditions may cause the company ceasing to
     continue as a going concern
    evaluating the overall presentation structure and content of the financial statements including the
     disclosures and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions
     and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
    we communicate with the supervisory board regarding amongst other matters the planned scope
     and timing of the audit and significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies in internal
     control that we identify during our audit

we communicate with the supervisory board regarding among other matters the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit we provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have
complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and
where applicable related safeguards from the matters communicated with the supervisory board we
determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the
current period and are therefore the key audit matters we describe these matters in our auditors report
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when in extremely rare
circumstances not communicating the matter is in the public interest




                                                                                                            146

the blameworthy road safety incident ratio improved by 64 to 073 incidents per 100000 kilometres
in 2014 initiatives conducted in the united kingdom confirmed that targeted action including installing
reversing cameras in vehicles and developing driver risk profiles can significantly reduce the number of
incidents

notes to the environmental performance

9 co2e emissions absolute
for sector comparison purposes the co2e footprint according to the greenhouse gas protocol
corporate standard revised 2004 can be reported in three categories

     scope 1 covers all direct emissions generated by sources that are owned or controlled by the
      company such as operational vehicles aviation and heating
     scope 2 includes all emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the
      company
     scope 3 refers to indirect emissions that are a consequence of the companys activities but occur
      from sources not owned or controlled by the company

tnts subcontractor co2e emissions scope 3 increased by 25 to 1600 ktonnes which was mainly
caused by the increase of subcontractor activities within domestics and international europe the
subcontractor co2e emission is calculated based on secondary indicators such as kilometres driven and
costs because of the unavailability of primary data fuel consumption of subcontractor activities

in 2014 the composition of tnts fleet of pud vehicles in european union countries changed to include
more euro 5 compliant vehicles and therefore cleaner vehicles the composition of the linehaul fleet in
european union countries changed to more euro 6 vehicles though the number of vehicles not
complying to at least euro 4 increased

12 own vehicles applied with telematics
telematics help drivers to improve fuelefficient driving and therefore reduce co2e emissions

the co2e efficiency for tnts european air network improved due to the replacement of aircraft and
growth in volumes the new aircraft are relatively more fuelefficient

at the end of 2014 tnt operated 54 aircraft since 2010 tnts air operations have been included in
the eu emission trading scheme eu ets the eu ets aims to reduce ghg emissions by putting a
price on carbon and includes all flights departing from and arriving at an airport in the european
economic area eea according to the updated european union regulation effective 16 april 2014
based on this intraeu scope the co2 emission of tnts flights subject to eu ets were 268 ktonnes in
2014 2013 269

entire year in which the divestment took place

way using percentages and ratios to allow readers to monitor and measure progress year on year
figures related to absolute co2e emissions are all extrapolated unless stated otherwise extrapolation
for buildingsrelated indicators is done on the basis of square metres where applicable the coverage is
defined as the number of ftes working in entities that report data divided by the total number of ftes

independent assurance report
to the executive board of tnt express nv
the executive board of tnt express nv the company or tnt engaged us to provide assurance
on the content of chapter 3 section ii of chapter 5 and the annexes of the 2014 annual report of tnt
referred to as cr chapters
our engagement consisted of a combination of reasonable assurance leading to an opinion and
limited assurance leading to a conclusion
 reasonable assurance on data and tables included in the cr chapters are marked with a rhombus
    
 limited assurance on all other elements included in the cr chapters
we believe these procedures fulfil the rational objective of tnt

our opinion
based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained in our opinion the
data and tables marked with a rhombus  included in the cr chapters of the 2014 annual report are
in all material respects presented reliably and adequately in accordance with the tnt reporting criteria
our conclusion
based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained nothing has come to
our attention that causes us to believe that the other elements in the cr chapters for the year ended 31
december 2014 has not been prepared in all material respects in accordance with the tnt reporting
criteria
this opinion and conclusion are to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of our report

the basis for our opinion and conclusion

what we are assuring
we have examined the cr chapters included in the annual report for the year 2014 hereafter the
report of tnt express nv amsterdam this report comprises a representation of the policy the
activities and performance of the company relating to corporate responsibility during the reporting year
2014 the disclosures made by management with respect of the scope of the report are included on
page 163 corporate responsibility reporting scope

limited assurance procedures are substantially less in scope than reasonable assurance procedures in
relation to both the risk assessment procedures including an understanding of internal control and the
procedures performed in response to the assessed risks

limitations in our scope
the report contains prospective information such as ambitions strategy targets expectations and
projections inherent to this information is that actual future results may be different from the prospective
information and therefore it may be uncertain we do not provide any assurance on the assumptions
and feasibility of this prospective information

the auditor is not expected to and cannot reduce audit risk to zero and cannot therefore obtain
absolute assurance that the corporate responsibility information is free from material misstatement due
to fraud or error this is because there are inherent limitations of an assurance engagement which
result in most of the audit evidence on which the auditor bases the auditors opinion being persuasive
rather than conclusive

reporting criteria
the company developed its corporate responsibility reporting criteria on the basis of the g4 guidelines
of the global reporting initiative gri which are disclosed on pages 173176 together with detailed
information on the reporting scope on page 163 we consider the reporting criteria to be relevant and
appropriate for our examination


understanding reporting and measurement methodologies
the information in the scope of this engagement needs to be read and understood together with the
reporting criteria for which the company is solely responsible for selecting and applying the absence

of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure nonfinancial
information allows for different but acceptable measurement techniques and can affect comparability
between entities and over time

our assurance approach

materiality
we set thresholds for materiality at the planning stage and reassessed them during the engagement
these helped us to determine the nature timing and extent of our procedures and to evaluate the effect
of identified misstatements on the information presented both individually and in aggregate based on
our professional judgment we determined specific materiality levels for each element of the corporate
responsibility data

work done
we are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of
the cr chapters

our main procedures included the following
 performing an external environment analysis and obtaining an understanding of the relevant social
   issues relevant laws and regulations and the characteristics of the organisation
 evaluating the acceptability of the reporting policies and consistent application of this such as
   assessment of the outcomes of the stakeholder dialogue and the process for determining the
   material subjects the reasonableness of estimates made by management as well as evaluating the
   overall presentation of the corporate responsibility information
 evaluating the design and implementation and testing the operating effectiveness of the systems and
   processes for data gathering and processing of information as presented in the report
 interviewing management and relevant staff at corporate and businessdivisionlocal level
   responsible for the corporate responsibility strategy and policies
 interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information in the report carrying out
   internal control procedures on the data and the consolidation of the data in the report
 evaluating the work performed by internal audit on selected corporate responsibility information
   including their visits to the entities in brazil china indonesia and south africa the purpose of these
   visits was to evaluate and test the source data and to evaluate the design and implementation of and
   to test the controls and validation procedures at local level
 investigating internal and external documentation in addition to interviews to determine whether the
   information in the report is adequately substantiated
 performing analytical review of the data and trend explanations submitted for consolidation at group
   level and
 assessing whether the cr chapters have been prepared in accordance with the sustainability
   reporting guidelines version g4 of gri

in addition to the procedures mentioned above for the data and tables as included in the cr chapters
and marked with a rhombus  we performed the following
 assessing the systems and processes for data gathering including testing the design existence and
    the effectiveness of the relevant internal controls during the reporting year
 conducting analytical procedures and substantive testing procedures on the relevant data
 assessing the processing of other information such as the aggregation process of data to the
    information as presented in the corporate responsibility information and
 corroborating internal and external documentation to determine whether the corporate responsibility
    information is substantiated adequately

we believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion and conclusion

professional and ethical standards applied
we conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with dutch law including standard 3810n
assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports hereafter standard 3810n our
responsibilities under this standard are further described in the our responsibilities section of this

material misstatement of the report whether due to fraud or error in making those risk assessments

procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the companys internal control

evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting framework used and the reasonableness of estimates
made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the report
