notes to the financial statements




17 impairment charges for loans and other losses
individual assessment of impairment
individual assessment of impairment for financial assets carried at amortised cost such as amounts due from banks loans
and advances to customers as well as held to maturity investments the group first assesses individually whether objective
evidence of impairment exists for financial assets that are individually significant or collectively for financial assets that are not
individually significant assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to
be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment

if there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred the amount of the loss is measured as the difference
between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future expected credit
losses that have not yet been incurred the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a provision account and
the amount of impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss interest income continues to be accrued and recorded in interest
income on the reduced carrying amountimpaired balance and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future
cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss

the present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial assets original eir if a loan has a variable
interest rate the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current eir if the bank has reclassified trading assets to
loans and advances the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the new eir determined at the reclassification date
the calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cash flows
that may result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral whether or not foreclosure is probable

loans together with the associated impairment provision are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery
and all collateral has been realised or has been transferred to the bank if in a subsequent year the amount of the estimated
impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the previously
recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the provision account if a future writeoff is later recovered
the recovery is credited to other income

collective assessment of impairment
if the group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset it includes the
asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment

for the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment financial assets are grouped on the basis of the banks internal credit
grading system that considers credit risk characteristics such as asset type industry geographical location collateral type
pastdue status and other relevant factors

future cash flows on a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of
historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the group historical loss experience is
adjusted on the basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current conditions on which the historical loss experience
is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently estimates of changes in future
cash flows reflect and are directionally consistent with changes in related observable data from yeartoyear such as changes in
zz interest rates

zz inflation rates

zz growth in gross domestic product gdp

zz global gdp growth rates

zz countries sovereign ratings ease of doing business indices

zz exchange rates

zz political stability

zz portfolio factors including percentage of restructured performing loans


the methodology and assumptions used for estimating provision for impairment including assumptions for projecting future cash
flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience			

details of impairment losses and provisions both individual and collective on financial assets carried at amortised cost and an
analysis of the impairment provision on loans and advances by class are given in note 32 on pages 300 to 307

impairment of rescheduled loans and advances
where possible the bank seeks to reschedule loans and advances rather than to take possession of collateral this may involve
extending the payment arrangements and the agreement of new loan conditions in case of individually significant rescheduled
credit facilities once the terms have been renegotiated any impairment is measured using the original eir as calculated
before the modification of terms and the loanadvance is no longer considered past due the management continually reviews
renegotiated loans and advances to ensure that all criteria are met and that future repayments are likely to occur

collateral valuation
the bank seeks to use collateral where possible to mitigate its risks on financial assets the collateral comes in various forms
such as cash gold government securities letters of creditguarantees real estate receivables inventories other nonfinancial
assets and credit enhancements such as netting agreements etc the fair value of collateral is generally assessed at a minimum
at inception and based on the banks annual reporting schedule

collateral repossessed
the banks policy is to carry collaterals repossessed at fair value at the repossession date and such assets will be disposed at the
earliest possible opportunity these assets are recorded under assets held for sale as per the sri lanka accounting standard 
slfrs 5 on noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations

operating in the manner intended by the management depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is
classified as held for sale or the date that the asset is derecognised

all classes of property plant  equipment together with the reconciliation of carrying amounts and accumulated depreciation at

21 income tax expense
income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax income tax expense is recognised in the income statement except to
the extent it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in oci
						
current taxation
current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to
the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years it is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
reporting date

accordingly provision for taxation is made on the basis of the accounting profit for the year as adjusted for taxation purposes
in accordance with the provisions of the inland revenue act no 10 of 2006 and amendments thereto at the rates specified in
note 211 on page 281 this note also includes the major components of tax expense the effective tax rates and a reconciliation
between the profit before tax and tax expense as required by the sri lanka accounting standard  lkas 12 on income taxes

provision for taxation on the overseas operation is made on the basis of the accounting profit for the year as adjusted for taxation
purposes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant statutes in those countries using the tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the reporting date


deferred taxation
deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes deferred tax is not recognised for
zz temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that

  affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss 						
zz temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the

  foreseeable future and 						
zz taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill



deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used deferred tax assets are reviewed at
each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised

unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used

deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse using tax
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date

the measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the group expects at the
reporting date to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities

additional taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends by the group are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay
the related dividend is recognised these amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss as they generally relate to income
arising from transactions that were originally recognised in profit or loss

inputs that are unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market for identical instruments

when available the group measures the fair value of an instrument using active quoted prices or dealer price quotations
assets and long positions are measured at a bid price liabilities and short positions are measured at an ask price without
any deduction for transaction costs a market is regarded as active if transactions for asset or liability take place with sufficient
frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis

level 2
inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable either directly ie as prices or indirectly
ie derived from prices this category includes instruments valued using
a quoted market in active markets for similar instruments
b quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered to be less active or
c other valuation techniques in which almost all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data


level 3
inputs that are unobservable
this category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and
the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instruments value

valuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models comparison with similar instruments for which
observable market prices exist option pricing models and other valuation models

assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include riskfree and benchmark interest rates risk premiums in estimating
discount rates bond and equity prices foreign exchange rates expected price volatilities and corrections

observable prices or model inputs such as market interest rates are usually available in the market for listed equity securities and
government securities such as treasury bills and bonds availability of observable prices and model inputs reduces the need for
management judgement and estimation while reducing uncertainty associated in determining the fair values

models are adjusted to reflect the spread for bid and ask prices to reflect costs to close out positions credit and debit valuation
adjustments liquidity spread and limitations in the models also profit or loss calculated when such financial instruments are
first recorded day 1 profit or loss is deferred and recognised only when the inputs become observable or on derecognition of
the instrument

notes to the financial statements




253 financial instruments not measured at fair value and fair value hierarchy
methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair value of financial instruments which are not already recorded at fair value
in the statement of financial position are as follows


fixed rate financial instruments
the fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost eg fixed rate loans and receivables due to
other customers subordinate liabilities are estimated based on the discounted cash flow approach this approach employs the
current market interest rates of similar financial instruments as a significant unobservable input in measuring the fair value and
hence it is categorised under level 3 in the fair value hierarchy


sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used to measure fair value of fixed rate financial instruments
a significant increasedecrease in the market interest rate would result in lowerhigher fair value being disclosed


assets for which fair value approximates carrying value
for financial assets and liabilities with short term maturities or with short term repricing intervals it is assumed that the carrying
amounts approximate to their fair value this assumption is also applied to demand deposits and savings deposits which do not
have a specific maturity

the following table sets out the fair values of financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value and related fair
value hierarchy

the bank may enter into certain lending commitments where the loan on drawdown is expected to be classified as held for
trading because the intent is to sell the loans in the short term these commitments to lend if any are recorded as derivatives and
measured at fair value through profit or loss where the loan on drawdown is expected to be retained by the bank and not sold in
the short term the commitment is recorded only when it is an onerous contract that is likely to give rise to a loss

35 investments in subsidiaries
subsidiaries are investees controlled by the group the group controls an investee if it is exposed to or has rights to variable
returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee
the group reassesses whether it has control if there are changes to one or more of the elements of control this includes
circumstances in which protective rights held eg those resulting from a lending relationship become substantive and lead to the
group having power over an investee

the cost of an acquisition is measured at fair value of the consideration including contingent consideration the acquired
identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition subsequent to the
initial measurement the bank continues to recognise the investments in subsidiaries at cost

the financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control
commences until the date when control ceases

the financial statements of all subsidiaries in the group have a common financial year which ends on december 31 except for
the serendib finance ltd a licensed finance company whose financial year ends on march 31 the financial statements of the
banks subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies

the department of supervision of nonbank financial institutions of the central bank of sri lanka

36 investments in associates
associates are those entities in which the group has significant influence but not control over the variable returns through its
power over the investee significant influence is presumed to exist when the group holds 20 or more of the voting power of
another entity

investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost in terms of sri lanka
accounting standards  lkas 28 on investments in associates and joint venture the groups investment includes goodwill
identified on acquisition net of any accumulated impairment losses the consolidated financial statements include the groups
share of the income and expenses and equity movements of equityaccounted investees after adjustments to align the accounting
policies with those of the group from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases
accordingly under the equity method investments in associates are carried at cost plus postacquisition changes in the groups
share of net assets of the associates and are reported as a separate line item in the statement of financial position
the income statement reflects the groups share of the results of operations of the associates any change in oci of those
investees is presented as part of the groups oci in addition when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity
of the associate the group recognises its share of any changes when applicable in equity through oci unrealised gains and
losses resulting from transactions between the group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in associate

when the groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equityaccounted investee the carrying amount of that interest including
any long term investments is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the group
has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee if the associate subsequently reports profits the group resumes
recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equal the share of losses not recognised previously

the group discontinues the use of the equity method from the date that it ceases to have significant influence over an associate
and accounts for such investments in accordance with the sri lanka accounting standard  lkas 39 on financial instruments
recognition and measurement

upon loss of significant influence over the associate the group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value
any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained
investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss

notes to the financial statements




after application of the equity method the group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its
investment in its associate at each reporting date the group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment
in the associate is impaired if there is such evidence the group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between
the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value then recognises the loss as share of profit of an associate in the
income statement

notes to the financial statements




37 property plant  equipment
the group applies the requirements of the sri lanka accounting standard  lkas 16 on property plant  equipment in accounting
for its owned assets including buildings under operating leases where the group is the lessor which are held for and use in the
provision of services for rental to others or for administrative purposes and are expected to be used for more than one year

basis of recognition
property plant  equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the
group and cost of the asset can be reliably measured								

basis of measurement
an item of property plant  equipment that qualifies for recognition as an asset is initially measured at its cost cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and subsequent costs excluding the costs of daytoday
servicing as explained in the note on subsequent cost the cost of selfconstructed assets includes the cost of materials and
direct labour any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and the costs of
dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalised borrowing costs purchased
software which is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of computer equipment
when parts of an item of property or equipment have different useful lives they are accounted for as separate items
major components of property and equipment

   cost model
    the group applies the cost model to all property plant  equipment except freehold land and freehold and leasehold buildings
    and records at cost of purchase together with any incidental expenses thereon less accumulated depreciation and any
    accumulated impairment losses

   revaluation model
    the group applies the revaluation model for the entire class of freehold land and freehold and leasehold buildings for
    measurement after initial recognition such properties are carried at revalued amounts being their fair value at the date of
    revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation on buildings and any accumulated impairment losses charged
    subsequent to the date of valuation freehold land and buildings of the group are revalued by independent professional valuers
    every three years or more frequently if the fair values are substantially different from their carrying amounts to ensure that the
    carrying amounts do not differ from the fair values at the reporting date 							
    		
    on revaluation of an asset any increase in the carrying amount is recognised in revaluation reserve in equity through oci
    or used to reverse a previous loss on revaluation of the same asset which was charged to the income statement in this
    circumstance the increase is recognised as income only to the extent of the previous write down in value any decrease
    in the carrying amount is recognised as an expense in the income statement or charged to revaluation reserve in equity
    through oci only to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation reserve in respect of that asset any balance
    remaining in the revaluation reserve in respect of an asset is transferred directly to retained earnings on retirement or
    disposal of the asset
    the group revalued all its freehold land and freehold and leasehold buildings as at december 31 2014 methods and
    significant assumptions including unobservable market inputs employed in estimating the fair value together with the sensitivity
    of same are given in note 375 b on pages 326 to 330

subsequent cost
subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic benefits of the expenditure will flow to the
group ongoing repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred

use any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and

notes to the financial statements




38 intangible assets
the groups intangible assets include the value of acquired goodwill and computer software


basis of recognition
an intangible asset is recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the entity and the
cost of the asset can be measured reliably in accordance with the sri lanka accounting standard  lkas 38 on intangible assets

intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost the cost of intangible assets acquired in a
business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition following initial recognition these assets are stated in the
statement of financial position at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses if any


subsequent expenditure
subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the
specific asset to which it relates all other expenditure is expensed as incurred


useful economic lives amortisation and impairment
the useful economic lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite the group does not possess intangible
assets with indefinite useful economic lives useful economic lives amortisation and impairment of finite and indefinite intangible
assets are described below
zz intangible assets with finite lives and amortisation

intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic lives the amortisation period and the amortisation
method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each reporting date changes in the expected useful
life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the
amortisation period or method as appropriate and are treated as changes in accounting estimates which require prospective
application the amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is expensed as incurred
zz goodwill

goodwill that arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented with intangible assets refer note 511 on page 257 goodwill
is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for
noncontrolling interests and any previous interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
subsequent to initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses for the purpose of
impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the groups
cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the combination irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the
acquiree are assigned to those units
zz computer software

software acquired by the group is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses
expenditure on internally developed software is recognised as an asset when the group is able to demonstrate its intention and
ability to complete the development and use the software in a manner that will generate future economic benefits and can reliably
measure the costs to complete the development the capitalised costs of internally developed software include all costs directly
attributable to developing the software and capitalised borrowing costs and are amortised over its useful life internally developed
software is stated at capitalised cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses
subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the
specific asset to which it relates all other expenditure is expensed as incurred

zz research and development costs

research costs are expensed as incurred development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an intangible
asset when the group can demonstrate
    the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale
    its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset
    the asset will generate future economic benefits
    the availability of resources to complete the asset
    the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development
    the ability to use the intangible asset generated

following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses

as at the reporting date the group does not have development costs capitalised as an internallygenerated intangible asset

31 2015 the new rate was not considered to be substanially enacted as at that date accordingly the groupbank has provided
for deferred taxation at the existing rate of 28 in the financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015

as per the direction issued by the public debt department of central bank of sri lanka on april 18 2005 with effect from
july 01 2005 primary dealers who maintain a capital above rs 300 mn were required to transfer 25 of posttax profits of the
primary dealer unit to a special risk reserve annually the bank duly complied with the above requirement up to december 31 2013

cessation of maintaining a special risk reserve as the bank is functioning as a primary dealer hence the bank transferred the
balances that were built up in the above reserve to the general reserve

57 contingent liabilities and commitments
contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present
obligations where the transfer of economic benefit is not probable or cannot be readily measured as defined in the sri lanka
accounting standard  lkas 37 on provisions contingent liabilities and contingent assets

to meet the financial needs of customers the bank enters into various irrevocable commitments and contingent liabilities these
consist of financial guarantees letters of credit and other undrawn commitments to lend letters of credit and guarantees commit
the bank to make payments on behalf of customers in the event of a specific act generally related to the import or export of
goods guarantees and standby letters of credit carry a similar credit risk to loans

contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position but are disclosed unless its occurrence is remote

operating lease commitments of the group as a lessor and as a lessee form part of commitments and pending legal claims
against the group form part of contingencies

even though these obligations may not be recognised on the statement of financial position they do contain credit risk and are
therefore part of the overall risk of the bank as disclosed in note 571 on page 359

in the normal course of business the bank makes various irrevocable commitments and incurs certain contingent liabilities with
legal recourse to its customers even though these obligations may not be recognised on the date of the statement of financial
position they do contain credit risk and are therefore form part of the overall risk profile of the bank

6714 b geographical distribution of loans and receivables portfolio
the western province has recorded a higher percentage of lending based on geographical distribution of the banks lending
portfolio it has accounted for 76 approximately of total advances portfolio of the bank excluding bangladesh operation as
at december 31 2015 although western province is vested with highest credit concentration we believe that a sizable portion
of these lending has been utilised to facilitate industries scattered around the country for example most of the large corporates
which have islandwide operations are being accommodated by the branches and corporate banking division situated in the
western province thereby reflecting a fairly diversified geographical concentration on such borrowers

the graph below depicts the impact on the net interest income nii of sri lankan operations  rate shock of 100 bp on rupee
denominated assets and liabilities and 10 bp on fcy denominated assets and liabilities




the impact of changes in interest rates on nii is measured using a static balance sheet which is subjected to 100bps and 10bps
shocks on rupee and foreign currency denominated interest earning assets and interest bearing liability portfolios respectively
thereafter the potential impact on the banks profitability due to changes in rupee and foreign currency interest rates is evaluated
to ensure that the volatilities are prudently managed within the internal tolerance limits above graph depicts the sensitivity of nii
to rate shocks during the years 2014 and 2015 right throughout 2015 the impact of rate shocks on projected nii has been well
below the management action trigger mat limit since august 2014 the impact has gradually decreased due to the conscious
decision of the bank to rebalance the fixed income securities fis portfolio
