12 our strategic plan
our strategic plan 201417 outlines our plans for our future and includes and responds to the
recommendations from the reilly review into dvla services carried out in 2013 the plan details
our vision and the objectives required to deliver our change agenda which will provide a centre of
excellence of digital services for our customers
dvla digital services
201415 was a groundbreaking year for dvla digital services with the introduction of a number
of new online services to customers as our digital transformation accelerates and expands our
customers are increasingly choosing to use our widening range of digital services in 201415
takeup of dvla digital services increased to
       75 for vehicle licensing 61 in 201314
       51 for driving licence services 33 in 201314


simpler licensing
abolition of the tax disc
in october 2014 the paper tax disc first issued in 1921 was abolished dvla the police and
other enforcement authorities use the electronic vehicle register to check if a vehicle is taxed and
no longer have to rely on a physical check of a paper disc most onroad enforcement action now
uses automatic number plate readers anprs
the vast majority of motorists pay their vehicle tax with latest figures confirming that 994 tax
their vehicles on time abolishing the tax disc has removed an administrative inconvenience for
millions of motorists and there are significant savings for fleet operators and other businesses
from not having to handle the administration of tax discs
direct debit
in october 2014 direct debit was introduced as an option for customers to pay their vehicle tax
motorists can now pay vehicle tax by direct debit annually biannually or monthly there are no
additional handling fees for annual payments but to limit the impact on the public finances there
is a small surcharge of vehicle tax for biannual and monthly payments
view driver licence online
dvlas view driving licence system was completed in march 2014 and the service went live in
october 2014 the free digital service delivers a high quality simple customer focused channel
that is costefficient allowing drivers to check their licence information online this service is an
enabler for the removal of the counterpart of the driving licence which will take place in june
2015 and is part of the governments red tape challenge
the service provides customers with a free 247 online facility to check their driving licence
record and gives customers more flexibility and freedom to use dvla services as and when they
need to the delivery of the service is in line with both the governments digital strategy and our
goals to make services simpler better and safer

my licence
dvla has worked closely with the insurance industry to develop my licence which went live in
december 2014 this allows drivers the option to allow insurers to check their driving entitlement
and current penalty points enabling quotes to be provided more easily and accurately based on
real time information this service will deliver benefits for honest motorists and will reduce
misrepresentation whether accidental or deliberate helping the fight against insurance fraud
removal of the paper counterpart to the photocard driving licence
dvla wants to make it as easy as possible for motorists and businesses to access government
services removal of the paper counterpart to the photocard driving licence reduces the amount
of paper and the burden on drivers this forms part of our commitment to the governments red
tape challenge to reduce unnecessary red tape
the removal of the paper counterpart was scheduled for december 2014 but delayed until june
2015 to accommodate corporate stakeholders concerns over their readiness for implementation
and also to avoid the industrys busy calendar year end we are continuing to work closely with
the motor industry to ensure that their systems and processes are as ready as they can be before
the changes are implemented
view vehicle record for fleets
the view vehicle record for fleets service was launched on 23 march 2015 and has been
developed as an enquiry service for dvla fleet scheme customers the service allows fleet
customers to access the vehicle records held against their respective fleet code through govuk
this service will be available to all fleets and will also allow them to choose to suppress the issue
of the vehicle registration certificate saving them an estimated 3 million a year
vehicle management
in january 2015 we introduced the first vehicle management digital service this service allows
motor dealers to tell dvla when a vehicle is sold into the motor trade
personalised registrations
dvlas personalised registrations service launched in march 2015 which allows individual and
commercial customers to take a personalised registration number off their vehicles this service
allows the user to retain the registration number to assign to a vehicle at a later date for more
information about dvla personalised registrations visit our website


excellent services

customers this has been a successful year for delivering excellent customer service over the
next few years as set out in our strategic plan we will continue to improve and expand our
services to deliver the best services in government

continues to provide some of the best customer service in both the public and private sector

change the contact centre provides an excellent quality of service and is one of the leading
providers of these services within both the public and private sector
customer satisfaction
dvla has always prided itself on excellent customer service and this is shown in the 201415
customer satisfaction survey which showed that 93 of customers were satisfied with our
service


new opportunities
business development
in 201415 dvla recruited a head of business development and formed a business development
team reporting directly to the commercial director
a dvla business development strategy was approved by the dvla board in december 2014 and
a 3 year business development plan has also been developed many new opportunities and
potential customers have been identified and a number of prospects are being progressed with
some at advanced stages the agency has been selected as the preferred supplier of print work
for a central government department and is awaiting proof of concept work to continue

       2014 was 60 an increase of 4 from the previous year

       technology qualification itq apprenticeships and worked closely with swansea
       university to attract and develop new talent to the organisation

       service management
      recruiting specialist skills  we have introduced new ways of recruiting using social
       media to attract the technology people we need to fill critical skills gaps
headcount
the number of fulltime equivalents ftes that dvla employs was 5147 at 31 march 2015
although above the target of 4880 this is due to the agency taking on additional work with the
introduction of direct debit payments for vehicle excise duty and in preparation for the planned
abolition of the driving licence counterpart the agencys priority is efficiency not headcount if
there is a need to hire local people to meet demand and this can be done efficiently this remains
a positive option
sick absence
the average working days lost to sick absence of 893 is 193 over the dft standard target this is
disappointing the reasons for this increase have been analysed in detail an action plan has been
developed and work has begun
diversity

responsibility to support the people that work with us and the communities in which we work

                                                    12

there have been some changes at a senior level this year all vacant posts on the dvla board have
been filled now 36 female although this represents some distance to go this is progress the
lack of senior women leaders at dvla is a longterm historical legacy and is clearly a major priority
for us to address

         developing staff skills to deliver digital transformation

13 it transformation
this year has seen significant work preparing for the move away from our current outsourced
contract with ibmconcentrix to bring control and management of our it services inhouse in
september 2015 we have continued to work closely with our colleagues at government digital
service gds to deliver several key digital services abolishing the vehicle tax disc and preparing
for the removal of the paper counterpart to the photocard driving licence in june 2015
the direction is to move away from more expensive and inflexible products to using cheaper and
more flexible services combined with doing as much as we can ourselves solid progress has been
made during the year to build the internal capability by creating partnerships with regional
technology enterprises universities and using the skills of our staff within the business the
strategy is ultimately focused on significant reductions in the costs of developing systems and
procuring expertise whilst simultaneously improving products and growing a highly skilled and
flexible workforce
dvlatechhub
in november 2014 dvla joined techhub in swansea which will build the agencys capability and
encourage locally based talent digital entrepreneurs and technology companies to work in a
unique environment to benefit by sharing resource knowledge experience and workspace it will
also work toward fostering a culture of mutual learning in the development of excellent digital
services applications and technologies


14 change portfolio
the dvla change portfolio has been realigned during the year to reflect the adoption of a digital
service based approach supported by newly appointed business service managers this continues
the theme of shifting from existing systems to the newer platforms in order to protect services
and business continuity and provide increasingly rich digital services to our customers
transformation programme  this consists of 4 delivery portfolios aligned to the delivery of key
services in the vehicle drivers common services and corporate services areas each includes a
number of key initiatives and infrastructure work to ensure business operations continuity these
initiatives focus on further online provision but not at the expense of the quality of service
offered under other channels
transition programme  this deals with the transition away from our existing outsourced it
model and focuses on the development of a new agency operating model this model will support
the requirements that will enable us to take control manage our own it service and build the
foundations of a more flexible digital and customer focused organisation

      sale of personalised registrations which represents commercial income generated
       directly from the public dvla retains income to recover its costs in administering
       personalised registration services with the excess paid directly to hm treasury as
       consolidated fund extra receipts cfers
      services delivered to other government departments
dvla is funded by a combination of income from fees cost recovery charges and supply funding
from dft the dvla seeks to break even year on year with the overall aim to provide value for
money for the taxpayer
reduction in fees
in october 2014 we cut fees on a number of driver transactions as a result of efficiency savings on
our running costs the new fees have introduced price differentiation for some transactions
between online and paper channels reflecting the lower cost to deliver the online services
amongst the changes on some transactions we introduced a price differential between online
and paper channels the first driving licence paper application fee is 43 and a digital application
fee is 34 compared to a fee of 50 for either channel prior to the change a ten year renewal of
a photocard licence paper application is 17 with the digital application being 14 compared to a
fee of 20 previously we estimate that cutting the cost of a driving licence will save drivers and
businesses 150 million over the next ten years
in addition there will no longer be a 1 2 or 3 year extension period for retaining a personalised
registration this has now been extended to 10 years the reduction in fees is possible due to the
fees and charges surplus generated by the agency in recent years as shown within note 2
financial results
this year has seen an increase in income against the 201415 business plan and prior year with
gross income collected of 541 million compared to the 479 million planned the increase
against plan is mainly due to
      vehicle first registration volumes have continued to exceed forecasts by 62 which has
       generated an extra 9 million
      driver related volumes are above business plan by around 26 for the key fee paying
       transactions the increased volumes alongside a delay in the implementation of reduced
       fees from 1 october to 31 october has resulted in drivers income being 10 million
       higher than plan
      personalised registrations has seen a successful launch of the 64 and 15 number plates
       auctions and online sales have generated an additional 6 million and 13 million
       respectively above business plan
      a delay in the removal of the personalised registration retention fee from october to
       march has resulted in additional 10 million income

                                                    15

total expenditure of 489 million for the year is slightly higher than the plan of 486 million
within the expenditure there have been the following major variances
       an increase in workforce related charges of 9 million resulting mainly from alignment
        of salary rates on implementation of modernising employment contracts mec as part
        of the civil service reform agenda and additional headcount throughout the year
        see page 12 compared to plan the mec package included a pay award revised terms
        and conditions and additional payments to compensate for changes to pay and
        contractual terms
       agents fees have increased by 3 million mainly as a result of the new heavy goods
        vehicle hgv levy service charge in year and additional wheelclamping activity these
        increases have been partially offset by reduced front office contract costs due to
        increased channel shift
       ict costs and professional services have decreased against plan mainly due to
        realignment of the change portfolio project delivery costs reducing and changes in
        delivery approach
       our depreciation charge is 5 million higher than planned as a result of a review at the
        end of 201314 financial year on asset lives in conjunction with the agency
        transformation plans

departmental expenditure limit position
as a government body the agency has budgets set at the start of the financial year in respect of
certain activities known as the departmental expenditure limit del the resource del outturn
for the year of 94 million came in 35 million under plan primarily as a result of the additional
income generated as described above
efficiency
the agency has completed its final year of the 100 million efficiency savings target compared to
the 201011 baseline the target has been exceeded with a final figure of 103 million recurring
and sustainable savings being generated with the key contributors being
       reduced pricing on the front office counter services contract which has led to 17
         million savings per annum
       realisation of the benefits arising from the modernising network services mns which
         contributed 30 million
       centralisation of northern ireland vehicles services has delivered 9 million but
         represents a 12 million per annum saving going forward
       retendering of the wheelclamping contract delivered savings of 7 million
dvla delivered over 100 million of efficiency savings in the period 20102015 and has
committed to deliver a further 7 reduction in 201415 with a total targeted 30 reduction in
net operating expenditure against a 201314 baseline by the end of march 2017 the agency is
on target achieving 10 efficiency savings this year

18 sustainability
further information on our sustainability performance is available in the report sustainability at
dvla published separately on our website the following section along with appendix c details
the minimum sustainability reporting requirements in accordance with the hm treasury public
sector annual reports sustainability reporting guidance 201415 and greening government
commitments ggcs guidance

201415 was the end of the reporting period of the ggcs these have now been extended
through to 201516 dvla has exceeded all of the ggcs with the exception of its greenhouse gas
ghg reduction explanations for the performance against each commitment can be found in the
table below
greenhouse gas emissions
this overall commitment is made up of 2 components
       emissions from travel
       emissions from the estate
the emissions created by business travel have been reduced during the 5 year period by 7246
this has been achieved through a number of methods including undertaking less travel
reduction in miles hiringprocuring lower emission vehicles and a mode shift from cars to rail

emissions from the estate
the potential volatility of electricity factors had been recognised previously and past conversion
factors were based on the average of the past 5 years this rolling average reduced the likelihood
of big variations yearonyear however the decision was taken by defra and carbon smart in
2013 to use data from one year instead this decision was made to provide an emission factor
that was as close as possible to the actual year of reporting and it highlights the difference the
energy mix in the national grid can make
the methodology for calculating conversion factors has changed our final outturn based on the
published conversion factor for the year was 19 had the methodology not changed we would
have achieved a more positive outturn of 22 however this would still miss the target
waste
waste has been reduced by 46 from the baseline year due to the modernisation of our business
water
we continue to achieve good practice consumption figures for our water consumption at 4m³ per
fte good practice is between 46m³ per fte however this is based on office space only
we believe that if we were to look at our whole estate a more realistic figure would be around
6m³per fte our consumption has reduced since the baseline year by around 7 but we aspire to
more please see appendix c for further details on water
procurement

      procure sustainably and reduce supply chain impacts by embedding government buying

the reilly review of dvla
the reilly review of dvla set out some key recommendations from a governance perspective
the review stated that dvla must have a governance and management structure fit for the new
world in which it will operate during 201415 dvla has considered this recommendation and
has put in place measures to address it
       a nonexecutive chair  lesley cowley obe was appointed on 20 october 2014 lesley
        works jointly with the chief executive on strategic direction for the agency the chief
        executive remains accounting officer the chair reports directly to dft
       a third nonexecutive board member  emma west was appointed on 1 november

        nonexecutive board membership to 4
       all executive team vacancies have been filled in this period
       the introduction of the chair and the additional nonexecutive board member has
        meant that greater accountability now sits with the full dvla board in terms of approval
        of expenditure the full dft executive committee remains as a point of escalation also
        during the year the governance around the exit from its existing it service provision and
        the continuing digital transformation has changed dvla now monitors its key change
        activities through its transition and transform boards this replaces the steering group
        comprising dvla dft and cabinet office

3 managing our risks
the agency risk policy is updated on an annual basis to ensure the risk management framework
and approach to risk appetite is appropriately defined and remains effective the current agency
risk policy was approved by the dvla executive team during december 2014 is published on
dvlas internal intranet site and remains aligned to the overarching dft policy
risks are identified and managed at several levels across the agency and captured on a standard
reporting template current risks are reviewed by the executive team on a monthly basis along
with a quarterly review made by the dvla board and audit committee
the executive team and agency board consider potential new risks that the agency faces on an
ongoing basis a specific risk identification exercise was undertaken in june 2014 identifying risks
to be included on the corporate risk register
the main risks to the agency at the 201415 year end included a number of inherent risks that the
agency will always need to monitor such risks would include ensuring robust business continuity
plans being in place to address a range of potential disruptive scenarios and the ongoing risks
based around the move to more digital services ensuring these changes minimise the risk of fraud
and any potential data breaches the agency continually monitors these risks and puts in place a
number of actions to mitigate such risks from occurring the agency has a continuous focus on
data quality for all stakeholders  their protection being a priority
significant risks are escalated as appropriate to dft in accordance with requirements set by the
department and hm treasury

the effectiveness of the agencys risk management framework has been reviewed during the
year
      our internal audit service will be performing an independent and objective review on
       the existence and effectiveness of controls over the agencys risk management
       framework the previous review confirmed that a sound framework was in place but
       that the agency could benefit from further embedding its risk appetite and
       strengthening its approach to mitigating partnership risks
      a risk maturity assessment to be conducted by an external review member has been
       aligned with the internal audit review and will be conducted in parallel last year the
       assessment concluded the agency continues to make progress in the area of risk
       management with increasingly mature risk management practices this maturity
       assessment supported the review performed by internal audit

4 fraud error and debt

recoveries are reported to cabinet office overall responsibility for the agencys management of
this area sits with the director of strategy policy and communications supported by a cross

intelligence team often in liaison with the operational criminal intelligence officers
5 managing the business  change and investment
the agency has a challenging portfolio of change and has introduced a new process for
introducing and prioritising change during the year the key features of this process are
       a rolling 24 month pipeline of change including contracts business as usual bau and
         business development activities high level scenario planning against key constraints
         such as affordability and capacity
       a business impact panel bip managed within the finance directorate and with
         membership from across the agency and chaired by an executive team member on
         fortnightly rotation this considers any changes that impact across the agency

portfolio to focus on the current it contract expiry in september 2015 and to prepare the

contractual authority emanates from me as accounting officer and is delegated to individuals in
specific posts primarily commercial director head of procurement and senior commercial
managers it is not transferable only those with contractual authority are allowed to commit
dvla to any commercial activity contract authority is distinct from financial authority and no
individual is permitted to exercise both for the same requirement

7 data controls
the management and protection of dvla information in particular personal information has
presented many challenges this year there are significant business challenges in terms of
increasing pressures to release information to third parties combined with the move to digital
services
management of information risk is the responsibility of the senior information risk owner siro
who is also the director of strategy policy and communications
the siro is supported by the information assurance group iag a network of information asset
owners and managers exists having local accountability for the information its release and
management of the associated risks this network is maintained and monitored by iag
we have had 18 incidents of personal data breaches none have required escalation to the
information commissioner this is a low volume in terms approximately 168 million transactions
processed annually by the agency
the agency has delegated authority to accredit its it systems the approach to accreditation of
systems has started to change initiated by projects currently in train at dvla the use of new
methodologies means that there has to be greater flexibility in approach to security particularly
with the move to cloud based environments and the shift to more advanced technology
development and monitoring of information release controls complaints and risks are now
brought to a data governance board chaired by the siro this is a new forum that has brought
renewed focus to information assurance activities across the agency
staff awareness and training has been focussed on the revised government classification scheme
which is greatly simplified compared to previous arrangements and focuses on the personal
accountability for the protection of information all staff have been trained in this approach the
revised scheme supports the dvla transformation programme but does require a reemphasis on
the importance of a greater focus on the role of the iao there is an ongoing programme of work
to move this forward

8 chief executive assurance
the system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to

whilst safeguarding the funds and assets of the organisation in accordance with hm treasurys
managing public money

effectiveness of the systems of internal control this is primarily informed by the agencys internal
audit reviews and the work and management assurance reporting of the managers within the
agency who are responsible for the development and maintenance of the internal control
framework
twice a year a management assurance statement review is undertaken to review all facets of
management assurance policy and practice the end of 201415 management assurance

evidence on the application of 69 aspects of assurance responses were reviewed and agreed by
subject matter experts internal audit audit committee et and dft

processes and the plans to address any identified weaknesses this ensures that continual
improvement of the systems remains a priority
these processes apply to all agency activities and transactions in the business and ved accounts

committees views on the effectiveness of the agencys governance risk management and
internal control arrangements
internal assurance
a single integrated internal audit team carries out the internal audit reviews this team operates
to prescribed public sector internal audit standards and provides the chief executive with an
independent opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the agencys system of internal
control together with recommendations for improvement the head of internal audit has
unfettered access to the chair of the audit committee and to the chief executive as accounting
officer but also works closely with the dft head of internal audit its audit plan for the year is

controls this includes assurance over the security and use of dvla data as well as contractual
commitments and data protocols for those organisations that interact with dvla

head of internal audit opinion
on the basis of the evidence obtained during the 201415 the head of internal audit was able to
provide a moderate level of assurance that the dvlas framework of governance risk
management and control is appropriately defined and working effectively
the head of internal audit has advised that this opinion reflects the strengthened governance
arrangements in place at board level this year and the increasing maturity of the agencys risk
management framework
established key controls were found to be working effectively with only relatively minor
improvements required however some areas impacted by the significant amount of change and
new services delivered during the year would benefit from strengthening procedural controls
the cases where internal audit identified the need for control enhancements were not deemed
significant in the context of the overall control environment where enhancements were
proposed corrective action has been agreed with delivery monitored closely both within dvla by
individual directors and where relevant by the appropriate governance board progress is also
monitored by et and the dvla audit committee to confirm actions are completed as agreed
actions against weaknesses identified have contributed to the overall assurance reported within
this governance statement
monitoring of specific control issues
risks to the ongoing provision of it live services to dvla were highlighted by internal audit as
being greater than the agencys appetite actions to address this are being implemented and
closely monitored in line with the established arrangements described above
in the opinion of the head of internal audit there are no further significant weaknesses that fall
within the scope of issues that should be reported here

notes to the accounts
note 1 statement of accounting policies
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 201415 government
financial reporting manual frem issued by hm treasury the accounting policies contained in
the frem apply international financial reporting standards ifrs as adapted or interpreted for
the public sector context
where the frem permits a choice of accounting policy the accounting policy which has been
judged to be the most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the agencys business
accounts for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected the particular policies
adopted by the agency are described below they have been applied consistently in dealing with
items that are considered material to the accounts
these accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to account for
the revaluation of property plant and equipment intangible assets and inventories and certain
financial assets and liabilities
new standards and interpretations adopted early
an amendment to ias 32 financial instruments  presentation came into effect for periods
starting on or after 1 january 2014 this provided additional guidance on the criteria for
offsetting financial assets and liabilities as the agency does not offset any financial assets and
liabilities this amendment has had no impact
new standards and interpretations not yet adopted
a number of new standards amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective
for the year ended 31 march 2015 and have not been applied in preparing these financial
statements
ifrs 9 financial instruments which will replace parts of ias 39 deals with the classification and
measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities hedge accounting and following the july
2014 amendment the impairment of financial assets ifrs 9 is intended to improve and simplify
the treatment of financial instruments in financial statements according to the international
accounting standards board iasb application of this standard is required for reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 january 2018 though earlier application is permitted however it is yet to
receive eu endorsement so it is not possible to predict the actual application date the impact of
initial application of ifrs 9 is not expected to be significant this is because while the
classification of financial assets and liabilities will change it seems that existing measurement
approaches will continue to be appropriate it is also considered that there will be no significant
change to the recognition of impairment on the agencys financial assets because the expected
credit losses on those assets are currently thought to be immaterial
ifrs 13 should be adopted from 201516 it provides guidance on establishing fair values of assets
and liabilities and sets out disclosure requirements where other standards require the fair value
to be used or disclosed it defines fair value as an exit value reflecting the assets highest and
best use rather than its actual use this approach is problematic for many central government
assets which may be of a specialised nature meaning that exit values are difficult to identify and
which may need to be retained for the provision of services meaning that the assets may need to
be retained in their current use


                                    dvla annual report  accounts 2014 15
                                                     55

 hm treasury has issued an exposure draft proposing modifications to the frem to adapt iass 16
and 38 these adaptations would require assets held for the provision of services to be valued on
an existing use basis using methods including depreciated replacement cost other assets and
liabilities would be valued in accordance with ifrs 13 where applicable the accounts include
assets that are currently valued using depreciated replacement cost it seems likely that the
exposure draft would permit this approach to continue it therefore seems likely that the
implementation of ifrs 13 as adapted by the frem will not have a material impact on the assets
and liabilities recognised in these accounts
ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers is expected to come into effect from 1 january
2017 though it has not yet received eu endorsement it requires the recognition of revenue as
the performance obligations under the contracts are satisfied its implementation is expected to
have no material impact on the agency
the international accounting standards board iasb has issued an exposure draft of a
replacement to the existing leasing standard which is expected to eliminate offbalance sheet
leasing arrangements and require recognition of a single rightofuse asset measured at the
present value of lease payments with a matching liability the pattern for recognition of the
expenditure will depend on the type of leases for most leases of property the lessee will
recognise expenditure on a straightline basis for most leases of other types of asset the lessees
expenditure will reduce over the term of the lease as the agency currently occupies certain
properties such as the contact centre under an operating lease this is likely to have an effect on
the statement of financial position but a more limited effect on the recognition of expenditure
other changes due to come into effect after 201415 are considered to have no impact on the
agency
accounting convention
these financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to
account for the revaluation of property plant and equipment and intangible assets the financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with the revised accounting direction issued by
hm treasury on 18 december 2014 they meet the relevant requirements of the companies act
and of the international financial reporting standards issued and approved by the international
accounting standards board we are not aware of any disclosures or circumstances where these
are inappropriate the financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis
income
income from the sale of registration marks is recognised on receipt of payment for fixed price
sales and on the fall of the auctioneers hammer for sales at auction uncompleted sales are
provided for after 90 days and are written out of sales after twelve months with the related

the value of the driver and vehicle databases cannot be estimated the dvla personalised
registrations database including unallocated vehicle registration marks is a very large store of
possible combinations of alphanumeric characters and is affected by changes in opinion taste
and judgement as a result the potential future sales value is not recognised in the agencys
statement of financial position as it cannot be reliably estimated

commissioned into operational service except for computer equipment which is provided for at
the date of purchase when assets are revalued the depreciation continues on the revised value
over the remaining useful life of the relevant asset the estimated useful lives from new of the

leases
the agency recognises operating lease rentals which are charged to the statement of
comprehensive net expenditureincome on a straightline basis over the lease term
leases in which the agency assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are
classified as finance leases upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount
equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments
subsequent to initial recognition the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting
policy applicable to that asset minimum lease payments made under finance leases are
apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability the
finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability

treated as an operating charge in the year in which it is incurred development expenditure is for
the development of specific business systems expenditure which does not meet the criteria for
capitalisation is treated as an operating cost in the year in which it is incurred development costs
meeting the criteria for capitalisation are treated as intangible fixed assets and amortised as
explained in the intangible noncurrent asset note note 7 noncurrent assets acquired for use
in development are depreciated over the expected useful life of the underlying system

the costs were capitalised on independent assessors sign off for each floor as complete and
ready for use the air conditioning doubleglazing and lifts are depreciated over the length of the

financial instruments
financial instruments are contractual arrangements that give rise to a financial asset of one entity
and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity financial assets are typically cash or
rights to receive cash or equity instruments in another entity financial liabilities are typically
obligations to transfer cash a contractual right to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities
with other entities will also be a financial asset or liability depending on whether the conditions
are potentially favourable or adverse to the reporting entity
nonderivative financial assets comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash
equivalents these are classified as loans and receivables the agency initially recognises these
assets on the date that they are originated and derecognises them when the contractual rights to
the cash flows from the asset expire
trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value on the date that they originated
fair value is usually at the original invoiced amount subsequent to initial recognition they are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses




                                    dvla annual report  accounts 2014 15
                                                     61

nonderivative financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables obligations under finance
leases obligations under onbalance sheet pfi contracts and a loan from dft the agency
recognises these liabilities initially on the trade date at which the agency becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument and derecognises when its contractual obligations are
discharged or cancelled or expired trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value
fair value is usually at the original invoiced amount subsequent to initial recognition they are
measured at amortised cost
impairment of financial assets
the agency assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that financial
assets are impaired as a result of one or more loss events that occurred after the initial
recognition of the asset and prior to the balance sheet date and the loss event or events has had
an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the portfolio that can be
reliably estimated
the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows the methodology and assumptions
used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between
loss estimates and actual loss experience
the agency does not hold any derivative financial instruments
contingent liabilities
in accordance with ias 37 the agency discloses as contingent liabilities potential future
obligations arising from past obligating events where the existence of such obligations remains
uncertain pending the outcome of future events outside of the agencys control unless their
likelihood is considered to be remote guarantees indemnities and undertakings are treated as
contingent liabilities
in addition to contingent liabilities disclosed in accordance with ias 37 the agency discloses for
parliamentary reporting and accountability purposes certain statutory and nonstatutory
contingent liabilities where the likelihood of a transfer of economic benefit is remote but which
have been reported to parliament in accordance with the requirements of managing public
money
where the time value of money is material contingent liabilities which are required to be
disclosed under ias 37 are stated at discounted amounts and the amount reported to parliament
separately noted
contingent assets
in accordance with ias 37 the agency discloses contingent assets that arise from past events
whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more
uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the agency and where an inflow of
economic benefits is probable
use of estimates and judgements
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with international financial reporting
standards requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities income and
expenses actual results may differ from these estimates

                                                    62

estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future
periods affected
information about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the
following notes
note 12  provisions for liabilities and charges
note 13  commitments under leases
the critical assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a
material adjustment within the next financial year relate to the estimated useful economic life of
intangible assets these are based on managements judgement of assets of a similar nature and
historical trends and are revised where appropriate where material the cost of untaken staff
leave has been estimated and accrued
the business account does not include any amounts collected by the dvla where it was acting as
an agent of the consolidated fund rather than as principal full details of income collected as
agent for the consolidated fund are in dvlas trust statement published separately from but
alongside the financial statements
payments due to the consolidated fund from the business accounts represent amounts in excess
of costs for dvla personalised registrationcherished transfer transactions the income from
these transactions is only deemed as due to the consolidated fund after the recovery of these
costs the surplus consolidated fund extra receipts are recognised in the statement of taxpayers
equity in compliance with the 201415 frem

 note 11 financial instruments

 due to the shortterm nature of the financial instruments held with the exception of finance
 lease and pfi liabilities carrying value is considered to represent the fair values the other
 financial instruments where carrying value is considered to represent fair values are accounts
 payables accounts receivables and cash the fair values of the agencys financial liabilities which
 differ from carrying amount as at 31st march 2015 are shown below
                                                                201415          201415     201314     201314

 the fair values above have been calculated using the discount rate implicit in the finance leases
 and pfi contract
 the agency has examined its contracts to identify embedded derivatives and concluded that
 where identified these are closely linked to the host contract and therefore need no adjustment
 financial risk management
 the agencys activities expose it to the following financial risks
          credit risk  the possibility that the other parties might fail to pay amounts due to the
           agency
          liquidity risk  the possibility that the agency might not have funds available to meet its
           commitments to make payments
          market risk  the possibility that financial loss might arise for the agency as a result of
           changes in such measures as interest rates movements or foreign exchange rate
           movements
 credit risk
 credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss should any of the agencys customers or
 counterparties fail to fulfil their contractual obligations to the agency some of the agencys
 customers and counterparties are other public sector organisations see note 20 there is no
 credit risk from these organisations
 for those customers and counterparties that are not public sector organisations the agency has
 policies and procedures in place to ensure credit risk is kept to a minimum

there is no impairment provision in either year as the agency believes that no allowance is
necessary in respect of any of its trade receivables
liquidity risk
as the cash requirements of the agency are met through funds voted by parliament financial
instruments play a more limited role in creating and managing risk than would apply to a non
public sector body
market risk
the agency is exposed to very limited market risk it does not deal in financial transactions and
also has very limited exposure to foreign exchange as the business is based in the uk in addition
cash balances are held in noninterest bearing bank accounts

an agent for others it is done in compliance with the accounting principles and disclosure
requirements of the edition of the government financial reporting manual by hm treasury
frem which is in force for 201415
the trust statement is prepared in accordance with the accounts direction issued by hm treasury
under section 2 of the exchequer and audit departments act 1921 the trust statement is
prepared in accordance with the accounting policies detailed below these have been agreed
between dvla dft and hm treasury and have been developed with reference to international
financial reporting standards and other relevant guidance the accounting policies have been
applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts
the revenue and associated expenditure contained in these statements are those flows of funds
which dvla handles on behalf of the consolidated fund and where it is acting as agent rather
than as principal although showing net liabilities because of the differences between the
recognition of revenue and the payment of cash these accounts are prepared on a going concern
basis
the financial information contained in the statements and in the notes is rounded to the nearest
million
accounting convention
these accounts have been prepared on an accruals basis and in accordance with the historical
cost convention
general accounting policies
revenue
ved and fines and penalties are measured in accordance with ias 18 they are measured at the
fair value of amounts received or receivable net of repayments revenue is recognised when
      a taxable event has occurred the revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable
       that the economic benefits from the taxable event will flow to the exchequer a taxable
       event occurs when a liability arises to pay a tax or licence fee licence fees are deemed
       to accrue evenly over the period for which the licence is valid repayments are
       accounted for on a cash basis and recognised in the year in which payment is made
      a penalty is validly imposed and an obligation to pay arises

tonnes or more and is aimed at ensuring these vehicles make a contribution to the wear and tear
of the uk road network uk hauliers make levy payments in accordance with preexisting
arrangements for ved nonuk hauliers make levy payments through a third party northgate
public services the role of northgate is to administer this charge and to make payovers to hm
treasury which are accounted for within the trust statement

by its related accounting policies

use of estimates and judgements
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with international financial reporting
standards requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities income and
expenses actual results may differ from these estimates
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future
periods affected
information about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in note 7

bad and doubtful debts
to give a true and fair view it is necessary to make allowance for ved and enforcement
receivables which we believe will be unlikely to be received in the future a provision has been
estimated using analysis of historic trends in debt recovery and write offs and is supported by
management judgement
evasion
the costs of ved evasion are outside the scope of the trust statement
related party disclosure
the agency is part of dft it has a large number of ved transactions with both local and central
government bodies at present these are not separately identifiable by dvla
deferred revenue
ved is paid in advance the deferred revenue balance relates to income received in 201415
relating to 201516
deferred revenue is based on the data collected at source using the period of the ved licence
purchased
a proportion of the deferred revenue balance will be claimed as a refund of duty during 201516
the value of refunds for 201415 is set out in note 3

licence fees and taxes includes 58 million 201314 nil of receipts from dft in respect of
reduced pollution certificate rpc discounts these receipts meet the shortfall in ved payments
from uk hauliers eligible for the rpc following implementation of the hgv road user levy
the reduction in licence fees and taxes  ved is partly due to the introduction of the hgv road
user levy in 201415 receipts of 146 million from uk hauliers are reported as hgv road user
levy income note 5 in 201415 the levy is cost neutral to uk hauliers as the cost of the levy is
offset by a corresponding reduction in ved

the comptroller and auditor general section 2 report
background
1 the driver and vehicle licensing agency the agency is responsible for the collection of
vehicle excise duty on behalf of the secretary of state for transport ved is vehicle road use tax
levied as an excise duty which must be paid for most types of vehicles used or parked on public
roads in the united kingdom in 201415 the agency collected net 61 billion 201314 61
billion of revenue and other income as reported in the agencys trust statement the amount
collected was in line with the budget forecast of 61 billion 1

scope of audit
2 section 2 of the exchequer and audit departments act 1921 requires me as the comptroller
and auditor general cag to examine the vehicle excise duty revenue accounts reported by
the agency in the trust statement and to ascertain that the agency has in place adequate
regulations and procedures to secure an effective check on the assessment collection and proper
allocation of revenue and that the agency is duly carrying out these regulations and procedure i
am also required by that act to examine the correctness of the sums brought to account and to
report the results to the house of commons my audit opinions on the agencys trust statement
and this report together satisfy that requirement
3 my team has examined the systems and obtained evidence on the adequacy and operation of
its regulations and procedure including consideration of the agencys compliance and
enforcement activities my conclusion on the agencys overall management of the vehicle excise
duty systems is based on this examination as well as taking into account evidence from our audit
of the trust statement itself and information from other sources including for example
consideration of the agencys governance statement

key findings
significant changes to vehicle excise duty
4 in 201415 the agency has implemented two significant changes to the collection and
enforcement of vehicle excise duty enabling motorists to pay by direct debit and abolishing the
paper tax disc my team has reviewed the systems and processes in place to support these changes
and has not identified any significant additional risk to the ultimate collection of vehicle excise
duty however the abolition of the paper tax disc has likely contributed to an initial increase in
reported levels of nonpayment which has led to additional compliance and enforcement activity
by the agency

5 between october 2014 when the paper tax disc was abolished and march 2015 the number
of cars in great britain identified by the agencys mobile automatic number plate recognition
anpr cameras as being on the road without having paid vehicle excise duty increased although
overall estimated rates of noncompliance remained very low the withdrawal of the paper licence
meant that vehicle excise duty became payable by the vehicles owner and did not automatically
transfer with the vehicle when there was a change of ownership as vehicles could not now be
bought pretaxed this increase in anpr detections is likely to be the result of some unintentional
noncompliance due to people misunderstanding the change as well as genuine attempted
evasion as a result the agency increased its communication to car dealerships about the effect of
change and also issued further compliance information and reminders to new vehicle keepers
6 despite this small initial increase in noncompliance overall noncompliance rates remain low
as the agencys compliance and enforcement regimes have prompted corrective action from many
car owners whose vehicles ceased to be taxed for example within two weeks of the tax being
due levels of noncompliance are broadly consistent with the period before the abolition of the
paper tax disc on this basis i consider that the agencys compliance and enforcement processes
are responding adequately to an initial increase in vehicle excise duty nonpayment in order to
prevent a material increase in lost revenue

conclusion
7 whilst recognising that no tax collection system can ensure that all those who have a tax
liability comply with their obligations i have concluded that in 201415 the agency has framed
adequate regulations and procedures to secure an effective check on the assessment collection
and proper allocation of revenue and that they were being duly carried out
8 based on their examination my team found that the systems in place for the collection of
vehicle excise duty managed by the agency through a range of channels including post office
branches local offices motor vehicles and electronic vehicle licensing and motor dealers are
reasonable in their design and were operated effectively throughout the year my staff did not
identify any major control weaknesses
