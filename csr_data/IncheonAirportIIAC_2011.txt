q1 which service provided by incheon airport impressed you the most
i think incheon airports service is improving every year the free internet access is very convenient also i found it
very thoughtful to extend business hours of the duty free shops near the operating gate for late flyers

q2 is there anything you would like incheon airport to do
as has been covered in the media it is unpleasant for a lot of people to see many smokers right outside the airport
gate maybe the airport needs to promote the use of the smoking rooms more actively in case the smokers are not
properly informed also in order for incheon airport to become a more globally acclaimed airport it should also cater
to the diverse needs of people for example by specifying restaurant menus for the those with religious food choices

                                                                                                               na bora                customer

                                          collaborative activities

                                          work with other partners being a giant organization all subsidiary organizations of incheon airport need to
