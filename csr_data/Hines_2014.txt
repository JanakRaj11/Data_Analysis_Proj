the future of sustainability



sustainability has so much meaning at hines we think about our partners
who invest with us to produce returns for future generations of their own
beneficiaries we think about our tenants and clients who are making the
environment a priority we think about the 3400 hines employees who rely
on hines to help sustain their own futures we consider the communities in
which our projects are located and the lasting contribution they can make
to the creation of better cities as we publish this third sustainability report
i am proud to say that for more than half a century hines has championed
sustainable practices and technologies proving time and again that a
sustainable approach to real estate makes good business sense and creates
better places for people
at hines and in the real estate industry in general we have made great
progress in our journey toward sustainability today green building has
become more of the norm yet we know that green building certifications
alone cannot meet the environmental challenges we face today we must
continue to evaluate and incorporate new technologies find new ways to
capture and analyze data and continue to leverage our influence for the
benefit of the real estate industry as a whole we can join together to make
even greater strides to improve the efficiency of the built environment and
create healthy resilient places for people to live and work
our sustainability report gives us a platform from which we can continue to
evaluate our progress and to ask questions like whats next for sustainability
in the built environment how can we make advancements toward
sustainability on a greater scale what new breakthroughs are needed in
technology and renewable energy what is the next generation of green
as always we will make it a priority to lead this conversation but we will also
listen and learn we are asking ourselves at hines and our stakeholders in the
industry to take on this challenge with a sense of urgency and inspiration
and to reach for an evergreater commitment to sustainability
