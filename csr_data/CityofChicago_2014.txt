businesses to thrive in march for example the city announced its second bulk
energy purchasing program which is expected to save as much as 24 million for
chicago residents and small businesses while ensuring coalfree power
even as chicago continues working to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions
from energy transportation solid waste and other sources we must also
enhance resilience responding to the changes already inprogress as the world

     transforming

     mayor emanuel and the chicago department of fleet and facilities
     management secured a contract to deliver coal free electricity to power
     chicago municipal facilities and street lights removing the equivalent of
     221000 cars from the road the contract was secured at a 2 percent
     discount from the citys last electricity contract amounting to a
     reduction in city electricity costs of 12 million over two years this
     agreement builds upon the success of chicagos municipal electricity
     program which has saved more than 720000 chicago households and
     businesses a total of over 36 million to date since launching february
     2013 supplied via a coalfree power mix five percent of which is
     generated by local wind farms in illinois

    22 reduce carbon emissions from all sectors
        greenhouse gas emissions  including carbon dioxide methane ozone and other gases that absorb infrared radiation
        in the atmosphere  result primarily from burning fossil fuels and releasing other chemicals into the air in light of its
        many sources greenhouse gas emission reduction requires a citywide portfolio approach sectorspecific reductions
        in 2014 many of which are highlighted elsewhere in this update stem from renewable energy programs like solar
        chicago multisector efficiency efforts like retrofit chicago expansion of public transit and electric vehicle education
        and adoption

    23 improve local air quality by accelerating performance toward federal standards and decreasing
        greenhouse gas emissions
        over the last year the city of chicago has taken steps to protect residents from petroleum coke petcoke dust a
        byproduct of oil refining and a fuel source for power generation when petcoke dust becomes airborne it can
        compromise air quality and create public concern after an extensive investigation and public comment period mayor
        emanuel and the chicago department of public health issued tough regulations on march 13 2014 that control the
        storage and handling of bulk materials such as petcoke including fullyenclosed storage and transport of materials as
        well as detailed monitoring and transparency

    24 protect the city and its residents by preparing for changes in the climate
        in 2014 the chicago transit authority completed a comprehensive assessment of potential risks
        and other impacts that climate change may have on the citys rail and bus transit systems the
        study identifies specific weatherrelated risks including possible flooding signal house overheating
        and rail kinks that have the potential to create public transit service disruption the cta will work to
        maintain and improve service levels through targeted investment the kimball princeton and state
        loop substation renewals will replace aging equipment and strengthen light rail infrastructure
