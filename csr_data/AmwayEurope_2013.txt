way we must ensure that the human resources team
acts as a partner to both management and affiliates to
help them achieve their objectives

of the reputation human resources policy image and
business and corporate responsibility strategy of amway
europe around 800 employees from across europe

as well as their opinions on our values management and
a range of other aspects of the company this survey is
essential to understanding what were doing right and
where there is room for improvement

michael schütz head of refugee shelter facilities germany

through the european headquarters in puchheim near munich amway has been involved in a range of community
projects devoting both time and money to helping children and adults live better lives

at puchheim we have more than 260 people from more than 30 different nations working together as one team
this gives each of our employees natural expertise in intercultural teamwork we decided to use this expertise to
help others as part of our latest volunteering activity

a group of european amway employees contributed to helping youths from different cultures to have a better start
in germany this included a multicultural activities day for unaccompanied minor refugees

more than 100 young people from some of the worlds major crisis regions afghanistan somalia iraq and syria
live at a refugee shelter in munich waiting for their application to be considered overall 90 per cent of them will
be allowed to stay in germany

in their daily life these young people hardly have any chance to meet any other german residents outside the
facilities and interact with them schütz explains

the wide range of activities included cooking lessons  getting to know german food and how to prepare it  as well
as bike repairs and bike riding classes woodworking a football competition and team building exercises

it was amazing how open friendly and eager to learn these teenagers were said donald employee from amway
different languages have never been a barrier amin one of the refugees expressed the same enthusiasm it
was such a great day the people at amway have been great and weve had a lot of fun ill never forget this event

puchheim

junior environment ambassadors




ebru karatas amway apprentice

the idea is for children to become ambassadors for nature in their communities

amway apprentices working students and interns working alongside environmental ngo friends of the earth
organised an afternoon for children to learn about environmental protection in a playful way

the mayor of puchheim and dimitri van den oever germanys general manager presented the 15 girls and boys 
aged between 4 and 12 years old  with certificates proclaiming them as junior ambassadors for the environment

one of the apprentices ebru karatas joined amway in september 2012 training to become a specialist for dialogue
marketing for ebru environmental protection starts with small things in daily life things like recycling can make
a big difference  if we all really separated and recycled our waste it would have a major impact you can see
how important the environment is for amway really fast when you look at the different garbage bins for separating
waste the efforts to save energy in the offices or the products which try to save waste by using concentrates

ebru explained her role in recycling week and the impact it had on her my project was an environmental afternoon
for children aimed at teaching them to become ambassadors for nature in their communities we created several
stations where the children were asked questions on certain topics through experiments and games it was very
interesting to get to know the other apprentices and interns who are about the same age but from different
departments we worked well together as a team and the whole event was an amazing experience
