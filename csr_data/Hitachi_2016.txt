     ordinary business meetings and conferences are limited
in agenda and company communications with employees
via our intranet and other channels tend to be oneway
town hall meetings meanwhile are intended as forums for
direct dialogue where employees can gain a real sense of
the senior managements way of thinking and what is
needed for hitachi to make the next leap forward as well as
occasions for reaching a shared understanding of the work
in which everyone is involved
     in the town hall meetings we believe that it is important
for senior management to hear the thoughts of frontline
employees and for both sides to share their awareness as
they engage in dialogue on diverse topics such as how we
can grow our business

promoting a proactive ir approach

     hitachis aims
sustainability management is expected to play an array of roles in realizing a sustainable society a key component of
the sustainable development goals sdgsthe centerpiece of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development adopted
by the united nations in 2015 we believe that meeting societys expectations requires a corporate culture that
unfailingly contributes to the resolution of social issues through the creation of products and services and that ensures
ethical and fair business activities
     we are cultivating a selfdirected corporate culture where csr perspectives are reflected in management decision
making and a common identity is shared throughout the hitachi group in addition to pursuing greater managerial
transparency and efficiency we have identified the main themes of this effort as sharing our codes of conduct and values
throughout the group and promoting multifaceted risk management in these ways we are accelerating the development
of corporate governance that incorporates csr into our decision making and operations across our business activities

system at hitachi ltd and at some group companies

  environmental load through the value chain
calculation of ghg emissions throughout the value chain
we calculate greenhouse gas ghg emissions throughout the entire value chain to more effectively reduce these emissions as
over 90 of emissions come from use of the products we have sold we worked to reduce emissions by developing ecoproducts
that meet environmentally conscious criteria throughout their life cycle
