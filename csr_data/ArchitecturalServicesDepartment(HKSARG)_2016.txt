   bim adoption roadmap
   building information modelling bim technology as a process of generating digital visual representation of
   building data offers an innovative way to enhance communications between different parties involved in
   various stages of a building lifecycle with bim technology and its data packed models building designers
   will be able to make more informed decisions to carry out innovative and sustainable designs

   following the guidance from the development bureau devb we have developed archsds bim adoption
   roadmap covering a period of five years from 201415 to 201819 we have investigated some projects
   in different works stages for trial if the progress of these works would be deemed satisfactory with the aim
   of evaluating the performance of bim and promoting the wider use of bim

   to prepare for the adoption of bim at archsd we place a great emphasis on awareness and skills training
   in order to address the initial challenges such as lack of special technical competence and dedicated bim
   personnel we have drawn detailed annual goals to implement bim in a stepbystep process in 201516
   archsd made noticeable progress on the following areas

            continued the engagement of bim consultants to assist in adopting bim for inhouse projects
            while lessons learned were reported in archsd academy sessions and knowledge management
            hub
            continued to explore the effective use of bim in different stages of project delivery by the branch
            bim working groups
            promoted an increasing use of bim technology where applicable for solving issues arising during
            project delivery
            consolidated experience gained on bim model developed in retrofitting project of 1f office of
            apb as a starting trial for future reference on possible bim applications on asset management
            formulated and achieved hands on training target for professionals and technical grade
            officers and
            formed a nondedicated bim group for incremental bim adoption

                                    different divisions of archsd as well as supervising staff
                                    training and recruitment activities in recent years some
                                    initiatives implemented by archsd are particularly meaningful
                                    in terms of promoting sustainable development the reuse of
                                    construction and demolition cd materials to build new site
                                    office use of hybrid and electric cars further application of the
                                    no frills design and agefriendly design principles in
                                    designing building projects are some examples
          mr wong mukwai
          chief technical officer   our department offers various formal and informal channels
          arch                   that facilitate staff communication and idea exchange the
                                    competitions organised under the staff motivation schemes

                                    looking ahead i suggest that archsd can consider working
                                    with other departments on sustainability initiatives more
                                    proactively to enhance its sustainability performance for
                                    example archsd can use more waterconsuming appliances
                                    which obtained the water efficiency label issued by wsd

     comment from client

                                     we worked with archsd for the development of tseung kwan
                                     o fire services training school fsts the fsts not only
                                     serves as a training school for firemen and ambulancemen
                                     but also acts as an engagement channel with the public
                                     owing to our distinct nature of firefighting services we had
                                     frequent meetings and discussions with archsd during the
                                     design and development stages to ensure suitable facilities
                                     and simulators are in place to suit our operational needs

                                     we highly appreciate the professional and technical advice
          mr yiu men yeung           provided by archsd throughout the process for example the
          assistant divisional       compartment fire behaviour training block requires burning
          officer of fire services   of wooden planks to create real fire and smoke scenario for
          department                 the training archsd recommended us to install a scrubber to
                                     filter the soot and particulates before discharging the smoke
                                     so as to minimise air pollution apart from environmental
                                     initiatives archsd also took into account of the dual purposes
                                     of the fsts during the design stage archsd had thorough
                                     consideration on the design and location of the visitor route
                                     which includes a museum and an education skywalk to
                                     enable the public to view our fire training venues and facilities
                                     without disrupting our daily operations we are impressed by
                                     the wholehearted support and timely response of archsd to
                                     cater for our specific needs and expectation i believe archsd
                                     would continue to deliver quality services to its clients and
                                     uphold service excellence

    sustainable building design
   in hong kong buildings account for over 90 of electricity consumption and about 60 of total carbon
   emissions of the city over the years we are committed to promoting sustainable building design and
   introducing smart features in our development projects to enhance energy efficiency and conserve
   resources

   in 2014 the government published the sustainable building design considerations guidelines to
   provide a comprehensive guide for our designers to practise green and sustainable building design to improve our
   built environment the guidelines outline most of the important design considerations of passive design in
   architecture and active design as well as provide useful references on sustainable construction materials
   and methods a standard particular specification ps has also been developed for the design of our
   temporary site office to further promote the use of green materials


   features of sustainable building design
   passive design in architecture

   passive design in architecture is an approach to building design that uses the building architecture to
   minimise energy consumption and improve thermal comfort at the early stages of the development
   projects we consider and adopt suitable measures in planning disposition orientation building form and
   material selection to optimise interaction with the local microclimate our passive design in architecture
   strategies include

            mitigating heat island effect or elevated temperature
            air ventilation around buildings
            daylighting
            natural ventilation
            passive cooling
            reducing heat gain through building envelope

archsd sustainability report 2016  resources utilisation and conservation  sustainable building design


   active design

   active design is an approach using the electrical and mechanical systems such as heating ventilation and
   air conditioning hvac systems and lighting systems to create and maintain comfortable conditions
   these installations will influence the energy use greenhouse gases emissions water use thermal comfort
   and other sustainability outcomes of buildings active design is adopted to improve the following aspects in
   buildings

            energy efficiency
            energy conservation
            water conservation
            indoor environmental quality

   construction and materials

   apart from passive and active design the use of sustainable construction methods and materials also
   plays an important role in sustainable buildings common sustainable construction methods include
   prefabrication pollution control during construction and adoption of 3r principles ie reduce reuse and
   recycle in addition we use sustainable materials such as recycled materials and timber from
   wellmanaged sources

    heritage conservation
   cultural heritage forms part of everyones collective memories tied with a city we therefore pay special
   attention to the preservation of archaeological and built heritage associated with our projects we aim to
   protect conserve and revitalise appropriate historical and heritage sites and buildings for the benefit and
   enjoyment of present and future generations to this end we identify protect and promote materials which
   are important to our culture and history

   over the years we have been working closely with the antiquities and monument office amo under the
   leisure and cultural services department to undertake heritage and conservation projects relevant
   projects completed in recent years include

            transformation of the former police married quarters site on hollywood road into a creative
            industries landmark
            relocation of the court of final appeal to no 8 jackson road and
            conversion of yau ma tei theatre and red brick building into a xiqu activity centre


   relocation of the court of final appeal to no 8 jackson road
   the building on no 8 jackson road was used as the supreme court of hong kong when it first opened in
   1912 it was later occupied as the legislative council chamber during 1985 to 2011 when the legislative
   council was planned to move to tamar it was suggested that this significant historical building can be
   revitalised and converted back into law courts to become the court of final appeal cfa the conversion
   project was completed in 2015 with the opening ceremony held on 25 september 2015

   the building was designed by two english architects sir aston webb and edward ingress bell who were
   the crown agents chosen architects the design of the building presents a mix of elements of orthodox
   design of the time as well as local features such as the chinese style pitched roofs the building itself is
   of high aesthetic value and is therefore worth to be protected and conserved with due care

   judges and judiciary staff of the cfa etc

   the cfa building is a building of great cultural value and is part of the community as such it is planned to
   open as much as possible the building to the public without affecting the courts operations regular
   guided visits to the cfa building are organised by the judiciary in order to enhance members of the
   publics knowledge on the history and operations of the judiciary and their understanding on the history
   and the architectural heritage of the building

   apart from incorporating environmental considerations into our projects we also implement inhouse green
   initiatives to manage our waste water and energy issues these initiatives not only help improve the
   environmental performance in our workplace but also promote a green culture at archsd


   energy conservation
   archsd has maintained an integrated management system certified to iso 14001 environmental
   management system iso 9001 quality management system and ohsas 18001 occupational health
   and safety management system in 2014 we also implemented an iso 50001 certified energy
   management system enms for our apb centre with an aim to strengthen our energy management
   building on the successful experience of this trial we have conducted a feasibility study and developed a
   roadmap for the implementation of enms to the whole department

   as an ongoing practice we also participate in the hong kong green organisation certification hkgoc
   scheme to keep track of our performance in terms of energy conservation in 2015 we were granted
   class of excellence of energywie certificate from the scheme in recognition of our achievement

   beam assessment on buildings

   since 1996 archsd has implemented the hong kong building environmental assessment method also
   known as beam developed as a voluntary scheme beam specifies sustainability criteria ranging from
   planning design construction commissioning to management operation and maintenance of buildings
   when a building is confirmed meeting certain predefined performance criteria after independent
   verification associated credits are awarded and an overall performance grade is then determined

   by the end of 2015 we had successfully obtained the beam and beam plus certifications for 42 buildings
   and beam plus interior certifications for 1 office
