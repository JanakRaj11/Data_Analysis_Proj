i think we have a good cooperative environ

     working here talented women talented
     people in the workforce here succeed
     my experience is that there is oppor

     who works hard and wants it i also be

     but its made all the difference just a                              started at rec in 2006
     few years ago this facility was down
     sizing now we are working on hiring
     good people for the expansion
we are stretched here  as we grow we
     are feeling the need for more people          the best part has been contributing to            and the process my time is divided
     i think the demands of supporting the            building up the solar industry its not a      between sitting in my ofﬁce reading
     existing facility and the expansion facility     typical experience you get in a pro            and being on the computer analyzing
     is sometimes taxing for existing staff          ductiontype company you feel you              data and doing tests in the laboratory

     munity i feel excited about where were         commend to younger people  a good              mass production was a big challenge
     going as a company                              place to work with a lot of possibilities       for me in terms of planning arrang
                                                      going forward                                  ing the experiments and especially
morten walman                                       but there are challenges for this organi         understanding experiment data how
scanwafer rec came to take over a                   zation compared to a place thats               ever its much more satisfying to make
   norsk hydro plant i worked at that was             established in its way of doing things          and see realworld progress here if
   shut down and what they were doing                 and its culture here there are still a        you ﬁnd something that makes a stable
   seemed interesting i have to say it was           lot of little stones to put into place it      improvement of 01 percent efﬁciency
   new for the 60 of us who came from                 takes time to build up a culture i mean       it is real progress
   hydro we knew absolutely nothing                  we started with nothing 5 years ago         when i came here i began investigating
   about what it was we were starting                 its not the kind of thing that gets            cell performance i studied the cell
   with there were a total of about 80               established overnight there are good           process for two months working as an
   people starting up this business from              communication channels and a good               operator ﬁrst the philosophy here is
   scratch coming from traditional pro              ﬂow of information today which                 good for new staff members  every
   cess industry to this was a big change            wasnt the case in the beginning but           one works at least two or three weeks
   there was a lot of fun  new equipment            now i would say we have a good sys            as an operator its a very practical way
   improvements learning new things and             tem and we have a good dialogue                to get you to understand the complete
   there still is there is something new             with the management                            process in mass production

23 segment reporting
a business segment is a distinguishable component of the rec group that is engaged in providing products that are subject to
risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments this also corresponds to the internal management
reporting in the rec group a geographical segment breakdown is based on the rec groups major markets and site locations see

a functional and presentation currency
items included in the ﬁnancial statements of each of the rec groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are pre
sented in nok which is the parent companys functional and presentation currency

b transactions and balances
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the balance sheet date exchange
rates foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities are
recognized in the income statement except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash ﬂow hedges qualifying net investment
hedges or as a part of a net investment

c group companies
the results and ﬁnancial position of all the rec group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation
currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows
i assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate
ii income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates and
iii all resulting exchange differences from translation are recognized as a separate component of equity

on consolidation exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities including monetary
items that are regarded as a part of the net investment and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges
of such investments are included in shareholders equity when a foreign operation is sold such exchange differences are recog
nized in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale the rec group did not at december 31 2006 or 2005 hold any
borrowings or other currency instruments accounted for as net investments hedges

able to the acquisition of the items subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognized as a separate
asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the rec group
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably all other costs are charged to the income statement during the ﬁnancial pe

210 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
the rec group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge a portion of its risks associated with interest rate and foreign cur
rency ﬂuctuations derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are sub
sequently remeasured at their fair value derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when
the fair value is negative as long as the rec group has no intention or ability to settle the contracts net the method of recogniz
ing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated and qualiﬁes as a hedging instrument and if so the
nature of the item being hedged derivatives are categorized as held for trading unless they are designated and qualify as hedg
ing instruments

derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or other nonﬁnancial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives
when their risk and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair
value with gains or losses reported in proﬁt or loss currently for the rec group this is relevant for currency derivatives embed
ded in committed purchase or sales contracts in which the currency in the contract is not the functional currency of one of the
parties to the contract

starting during 2006 the rec group has designated certain derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge a portion of its risks as
sociated with foreign currency ﬂuctuations related to highly probable future purchase or sales transaction and applied hedge
accounting at the inception of a hedge relationship the rec group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship
to which the rec group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking
the hedge the documentation includes identiﬁcation of the hedging instrument the hedged item or transaction the nature of
the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to change
in the hedged items fair value or cash ﬂows attributable to the hedged risk such hedges are expected to be highly effective in
achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash ﬂows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have
been highly effective throughout the ﬁnancial reporting periods for which they were designated

at yearend 2006 rec has only applied cash ﬂow hedges to hedge highly probable transactions such as the purchase and sale
of goods in a foreign currency a cash ﬂow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash ﬂows that is attributable to a
particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect proﬁt or
loss the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized directly in equity while the ineffective por
tion is recognized in proﬁt or loss amounts taken to equity are transferred to proﬁt or loss when the hedged transaction affects
proﬁt or loss such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs where the hedged item is the cost of a nonﬁnancial asset or
liability the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the nonﬁnancial asset or liability

if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur amounts previously recognized in equity are transferred to proﬁt or
loss if the hedging instrument expires or is sold terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover or if its designation as
a hedge is revoked amounts previously recognized in equity remain in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs if the re
lated transaction is not expected to occur the amount is taken to proﬁt or loss

211 inventories
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost for inventory with different nature or use is determined
using the ﬁrstin ﬁrstout fifo or average cost method the cost of ﬁnished goods and work in progress comprises raw mate
rials direct labor other direct costs and related production overheads based on normal operating capacity net realizable value
is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling expenses the rec group is inte
grated in the value chain and rec entities sell goods to other rec entities consequently ﬁnished goods for one rec entity be
come raw materials or work in progress for another rec entity the classiﬁcation by the separate entities is also used in the
classiﬁcation in recs consolidated accounts

212 trade receivables
trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost less provisions for impair
ment a provision for impairment of trade receivables is recognized in the income statement and is established when there is
objective evidence that the rec group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables
signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculty of the debtor probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or ﬁnancial reorganization and de
fault or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired

213 cash and cash equivalents
                                                                                                                                             accounts rec group




cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and demand deposits at banks and money market funds

                         risk the rec groups overall risk management policy focuses on the unpredictability of ﬁnancial markets and seeks to minimize
                         potential adverse effects on the rec groups ﬁnancial performance the rec group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge
                         exposures arising from operational ﬁnancing and investment activities in accordance with the ﬁnance policy

                         a currency risk
                         at the beginning of 2006 the rec group implemented a revised ﬁnance policy in connection with the reﬁnancing of the rec
                         group at march 31 ﬁnancing was transferred from the subsidiary level to the rec group level to enable a centralized manage

to manage currency risk arising from commercial transactions rec entities use forward contracts including ﬂexible forward
contracts and participating forward contracts the rec subsidiaries manage their currency risk by doing foreign exchange con
tracts with rec asa rec asa manages the currency risk on an overall group level and enters into external foreign exchange
contracts with banks in 2006 hedge accounting according to ias 39 financial instruments was used to cash ﬂow hedge certain
revenues and expenses of rec wafer some currency hedging is also performed in other rec companies without hedge account
ing the rec groups general policy is to cover between 80 percent and 100 percent of net transaction currency exposure on a
rolling 12 month basis the policy deﬁnes coverage of the net exposure for a 48 month period with gradually declining cover
age

the rec group is exposed to currency risk from recognized assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entities
functional currencies including group internal balances in addition rec has investments in foreign operations whose net assets
are exposed to currency translation risk these exposures are hedged only to a limited extent

b credit risk
the rec group has some concentrations of credit risk as it has a few large customers policies are in place to ensure that sales of
products are only made to customers with an appropriate credit history in combination with requirements for various payment
guarantees or prepayments the rec group has experienced limited losses on receivables managements opinion is that the rec
group has no signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk

intra group balances are eliminated on consolidation of subsidiaries the rec group proportionally consolidates 3333 percent of
everq and consequently rec has some credit exposure related to provided loans and guarantees

derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to highcreditquality ﬁnancial institutions

c liquidity risk
prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufﬁcient cash and cash equivalents and having availability of funding
through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses the rec
group aims to maintain a high degree of ﬁnancial ﬂexibility by keeping sufﬁcient cash and cash equivalents or committed credit
lines available

d interest rate risk
changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of assets and liabilities or the variability in cash payments the rec group
is exposed to interest rate risk through funding and cash management activities interest bearing assets carry variable interest
subsequent to the equity increase in may 2006 the rec group has held interestbearing assets primarily exposed to changes in
nok interest rates see note 17 for interest rate sensitivity interest income and interest expense in the income statement as well
as interest payments are inﬂuenced by interest rate changes

when in a net debt position the rec group policy is set to balance interest rate risk through a combination of variable and ﬁxed
interest rate borrowings the group then aims to ensure that at least 25 percent of borrowings are ﬁxed and 25 percent of bor
rowings are ﬂoating with the remainder being set as appropriate interest rate swaps may be utilized where necessary to
achieve the desired balance

32 fair value estimation
in 2005 and 2006 proﬁt was signiﬁcantly negatively affected by noncash effects from changes in the fair value assessment and
foreign exchange effects of two convertible loans during 2006 these loans were converted to equity see note 27

the fair value of foreign exchange derivatives see note 11 is based on quoted market prices at the reporting dates the fair
value calculations were performed by independent banks

at december 31 2006 the carrying amounts of the rec groups ﬁnancial assets and liabilities excluding investments in associ
ates jointly controlled entities and subsidiaries are assumed to approximate their fair values

the rec group had at december 31 2006 insigniﬁcant ﬁnancial assets available for sale

                         costs that are expensed cannot be capitalized at a later point in time consequently there may be development of intangible as
                         sets that cannot be capitalized because the company cannot demonstrate that all requirements are fulﬁlled at the relevant points
                         in time at yearend 2006 most development costs have been expensed except development costs relating to the fluidized bed

42 key sources of estimation uncertainty  critical accounting estimates
the preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the report
ing period actual results could differ from those estimates certain amounts included in or affecting the rec groups ﬁnancial
statements and related disclosure must be estimated requiring management to make assumptions with respect to values or
conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the ﬁnancial statements are prepared a critical accounting esti
mate is one which is both important to the portrayal of the companys ﬁnancial condition and results and requires management
to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and which are subjective or complex management
evaluates such estimates on an ongoing basis based upon historical results and experience consultation with experts utilizing
trends and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances as well as forecasts as to how these might
change in the future

a impairment
the rec group tests annually whether goodwill or intangible assets for which amortization has not started have suffered any
impairment property plant and equipment other intangible and ﬁnancial assets are tested for impairment when circumstances
indicate there may be a potential impairment factors management considers important and which could trigger an impairment
review include signiﬁcant fall in market values a signiﬁcant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating
results signiﬁcant changes in the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business including assets that are decided to
be phased out or replaced and assets that are damaged or taken out of use signiﬁcant negative industry or economic trends and
signiﬁcant cost overruns in the development of assets

the recoverable amounts of assets and cashgenerating units have been determined based on valueinuse calculations these
calculations require the use of estimates including estimates of future performance revenue generating capacity of the assets
assumptions of the future market conditions and the success in development and marketing of new products and services
changes in circumstances and in managements evaluations and assumptions may give rise to impairment losses in the relevant
periods for the period presented no signiﬁcant impairments have been recognized see notes 6 7 and 8

b depreciation and amortization
depreciation and amortization are based on management estimates of the future useful lives of property plant and equipment
and intangible assets estimates may change due to technological developments competition changes in market conditions
expectations for replacements or disposal of assets and other factors and may result in changes in the estimated useful lives and
in amortization or depreciation charges technological developments are difﬁcult to predict and the rec groups views on the
trends and pace of development may change over time management periodically reviews the expected future useful lives of
property plant and equipment and intangible assets taking into consideration the factors mentioned above and all other impor
tant factors in case of signiﬁcant changes in estimated useful lives depreciation and amortization charges are adjusted prospec
tively in the case of replacements or disposals any remaining carrying value will be recognized to the income statement net of
any proceeds receivable

c business combinations joint ventures and associated companies
the rec group is required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies including joint ventures and associated compa
nies to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values such valuations require management to
make signiﬁcant estimates and assumptions the acquired intangible assets recognized by the rec group include customer rela
tionships order backlog customer contracts of which one is recognized as a liability see note 20 developed technology and
inprocess research and development the signiﬁcant tangible assets primarily include processing property plants and equip
ment critical estimates in the evaluations of useful lives for such assets include but are not limited to contract periods and
expected developments in technology and markets critical estimates in valuing certain assets include but are not limited to
future expected net cash ﬂows for customer contracts and hypothetic patent licensing and replacement costs for inprocess
research and development and property plant and equipment managements estimates of fair value and useful lives are based
upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results

vides social security payments to all retired norwegian citizens such payments are calculated by reference to a base amount

vice and compensation the cost of pension beneﬁt plans is expensed over the period that the employee renders services and
becomes eligible to receive beneﬁts

the rec group offers primarily contribution plans to employees outside of norway rec silicon has an employersponsored re
tirement plan 401 k for employees in the usa in which the contributions to the plan are determined each year asimi had
deﬁned beneﬁt plans at the time it was acquired in 2005 subsequent to the acquisition the asimi deﬁned beneﬁt plans were
frozen and no future beneﬁts are accruing to the members of the plans previous pension rights remained unchanged curtail
ment gains of nok 42 million were recognized as part of pension costs in 2005

plan for this plan and the deﬁned beneﬁt multiemployer plans in rec scanmodule ab the administrators are not able to cal
culate the rec groups share of assets and liabilities and these plans are consequently accounted for as deﬁned contribution

rent service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method the discount rate for the deﬁned
beneﬁt plan in norway was estimated based on the interest rate on norwegian government bonds average time before the pay
ments of earned beneﬁts was calculated at 40 years and the discount rate was projected to a 40year rate through a reference
to european longterm interest rates as the longest duration in norway is 10 years the assumption for salary increase increase
in pension payments and gregulation are tested against historical observations statements made about the future develop
ments and the relationship between different assumptions

before the rec group was listed on oslo stock exchange in may 2006 the fair value of the embedded derivatives was calculated
by independent brokers the share price was estimated as follows the expected share price on the relevant dates was estimated
based on historical transactions for the company shares modiﬁed by a peer group of comparative companies that are listed on
stock exchanges this share price was used as an input to the blackscholes formula that estimates the expected share price at
the date of conversion in addition to the share price the model inputs were the exercise prices in the bonds expected volatility
of the company share price over the bonds lifetime and a risk free interest rate volatility was based on the peer group of com
parative companies the estimate of fair value took into account foreign exchange rates

at the date of issue of the convertible loans the base loan element was recorded at a value that was lower than the amount that
was due to be repaid on maturity date the loans accreted to the full value over the life of the loan based on the effective interest
rate method adjusted to reﬂect the changes in foreign exchange rates this accretion has been included within the fair value

                           therefore pro forma adjustments are required to include the results of asimi from january 1 2005 to july 31 2005
                          earnings before ﬁnancial items taxes depreciation and amortization have been increased to include 7 months of earnings from

                          depreciation and amortization has been recalculated by class of asset giving a combined 7 month charge of nok 84 million
                          the acquisition was ﬁnanced with a convertible loan from existing shareholder of usd 140 million and senior debt from dnb
                           nor and abn amro of usd 170 million average interest rates for the two loans combined have been calculated at 608 per

                          the tax rate used is 34 percent which represented the local tax rate faced by rec silicon related to asimi in this period and is
