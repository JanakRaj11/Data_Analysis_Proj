ladies and gentlemen
dear coshareholders

over three family generations and a period of 125 years kuehne 
nagel has developed from modest beginnings to one of the worlds
three largest logistics companies this achievement is not only
attributable to our corporate policy which has always focused on
healthy growth and economic efficiency but above all to our many
hardworking employees all around the world

even today we still follow our basic principles of choosing our
employees carefully motivating them and enabling them to progress
in the company over the years and decades this has resulted in a
team spirit that shapes our culture and is simply indispensable for
a logistics company with a global presence increasingly complex
tasks and a crosssectional function

i owe my thanks to my grandfather and my father they dedicated
their lives to the weal and woe of kuehne  nagel and guided
the company through good times and bad with a great sense of
responsibility entrepreneurial spirit creativity and hard work

as a result of this i too developed very close emotional ties
with the company since the early 1960s i was privileged to play
a decisive role in shaping its development and together with an
excellent management team steer a successful course thus it was
possible to achieve my goal of creating a global logistics network
in parallel to this we have continually expanded our product
portfolio and constantly improved the service quality there had
been crisis and setbacks but we overcame these through hard work
commitment and good fortune

in 2015 the companys 125th anniversary year we were pleased
to see that kuehne  nagel stands on firm foundations and is
seizing the opportunities offered by this globalised world with
unabated momentum the annual result clearly confirms this

the management team is well established the board of directors
and the management board work successfully together the entre
preneurial spirit that has shaped the companys development over
the last 125 years still prevails with a high level of responsibility
and expertise giving me the confidence that kuehne  nagel will
continue to successfully maintain and expand its position as one
of the globally leading logistics companies

i would like to thank all employees for their valuable contributions
to the companys success special thanks also go to our customers
around the world without whose loyal business relations with
kuehne  nagel we would not be where we are today

i am delighted that many of our customers and business partners
were able to celebrate our 125th anniversary with us within the
scope of our container anniversary world tour



yours sincerely

klausmichael kuehne

report of the board of directors                                                                                             3




                               new record high in the anniversary year
                          earnings for the year in swiss francs up 54 per cent



                 in 2015 the kuehne  nagel group increased its profitability in a market
            environment characterised by high volatility currency shifts and geopolitical crises
               while net turnover and gross profit fell slightly for currency conversion reasons
              the operational result ebitda increased by 36 per cent to chf 1041 million
            despite negative currency effects of 73 per cent net earnings for the year improved
                                     by 54 per cent to chf 679 million




            interview with karl gernandt                         commitment we can be very satisfied with what
            chairman of the board of directors                    we achieved in the anniversary year

            mr gernandt how was 2015 for the                    what were the main challenges in the market
            kuehne  nagel group                                 environment

            karl gernandt 2015 was a challenging highly         karl gernandt let us start with the volatile currency
            successful but also very emotional year for the       environment an international logistics company
            kuehne  nagel group the fact that a company         is subjected to exchange rate shifts in two regards
            can look back at 125 years of history is an amazing   firstly they affect the earnings  in our case the
            achievement in itself and if after 125 years it    increase in earnings for the year slowed by 73 per cent
            can present itself like kuehne  nagel  tradition    and secondly they result in changes to the global
            conscious yet still young and innovative with        goods flows in todays market it is far from unusual
            economic success globally despite difficult market    for customers to relocate their sourcing at short
            conditions  this is something to be proud of        notice this calls for flexibility and quick responses
                                                                  on behalf of the logistics provider
            i am also proud of how strongly our employees
            identify with the company and the dedication and      furthermore the geopolitical crises the slower
            enthusiasm they show in contributing to shape         growth in the rawmaterialexporting countries
            its future development this was something that       austerity policies in europe and chinas new eco
            i tangibly experienced all around the world during    nomic orientation all prevented the upturn of overall

            the global economic environment in which we          it suffered from the harsh winter in the first quarter
            operate with its abrupt and disruptive develop      and the protracted port strike on the west coast
            ments was certainly challenging so were the tar    to return to china for a moment there is no other
            gets we set ourselves but we met these through       region anywhere in the world that is growing that
            the consistent implementation of the strategy we      fast and which is still driving the global exchange

          in my opinion adaptive management is particularly important in volatile
       times this means that you have to have clearly defined strategic objectives but
               you need to be adaptable with regard to their implementation



    how did kuehne  nagel deal with these challenges       in the overland business we are on the right track
                                                             and the acquisition of retrans a leading us pro

5            principles of consolidation

business combinations
business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method the group measures good
will as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the fair value of any previously held equity
interest in the acquiree and the recognised amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree less the
net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed all
measured as of the acquisition date if the excess is negative a bargain purchase gain is recognised
immediately in profit or loss

82   consolidated financial statements 2015         notes to the consolidated financial statements




     the group elects on a transactionbytransaction basis whether to measure noncontrolling interest at
     its fair value or at its proportionate share of the recognised amount of the identifiable net assets at the
     acquisition date

     consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred liabilities incurred by the group to
     the previous owners of the acquiree equity interests issued by the group and the fair value of any contingent
     consideration if the contingent consideration is classified as equity it is not remeasured and settlement is
     accounted for within equity otherwise subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration
     are recognised in profit or loss the consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settle
     ment of preexisting relationships such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss

     transaction costs other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities incurred in connec
     tion with a business combination are expensed as incurred

     written put options held by noncontrolling shareholders
     if the group has a potential obligation to purchase shares in a subsidiary from a noncontrolling share
     holder through a written put option a liability is recognised at the present value of the redemption
     amount with a corresponding entry in equity if a noncontrolling shareholder still has present access to
     the economic benefits associated with the underlying ownership interest the noncontrolling interest in
     the subsidiary continues to be recognised as a separate component in equity

     the liability is reestimated at each reporting date any subsequent changes in the liabilitys carrying amount
     are recognised in profit or loss

     for the reporting year 2015 there is no written put option outstanding

     acquisitions and disposals of noncontrolling interests
     changes in the parents ownership interest in a subsidiary after having obtained control that do not result in a
     loss of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and the effect of such
     transactions is recognised in equity no goodwill is recognised as a result of acquisition of noncontrolling in
     terests and no gain or loss on disposals of noncontrolling interests is recognised in profit or loss adjustments
     to noncontrolling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary

               consolidated financial statements 2015        notes to the consolidated financial statements       83




subsidiaries
the group controls an investee when it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement
with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee subsidiaries
are companies controlled directly or indirectly by the group normally this control is evidenced if the group
owns either directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the voting rights whereby potential voting rights
are also considered subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements by the full consoli
dation method as from the date on which control is transferred to the group until the date control ceases
the noncontrolling interests in equity as well as earnings for the period are reported separately in the
consolidated financial statements

disposal of subsidiaries
when the group ceases to have control over a subsidiary it derecognises the assets and liabilities of
the respective subsidiary as well as any related noncontrolling interest and other components of equity
any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement any retained interest in the former
subsidiary is remeasured to its fair value at the date when the control is lost

associates and joint ventures
associates are companies over which the group has significant influence but which it does not control
significant influence is normally evidenced if the group owns 20 per cent or more of the voting or potential
voting rights joint ventures are contractual arrangements in which the group has joint control whereby
the group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement rather than rights to its assets and obligations
for its liabilities

interests in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method they are initially recog
nised at cost including transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition the groups share of the profit
or loss and other comprehensive income of associates and joint ventures is included in the groups financial
statements until the date significant influence or joint control ceases

transactions eliminated on consolidation
intragroup balances transactions income and expenses are eliminated in preparing the consolidated finan
cial statements

     foreign exchange translation
     financial statements of consolidated companies are prepared in their respective functional currencies and

     goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation are translated at yearend exchange rates and
     all items included in the income statement are translated at average exchange rates for the year which
     approximate actual rates exchange differences originating from such translation methods have no impact
     on the income statement since they are recognised in other comprehensive income

     transactions in foreign currencies in individual subsidiaries are translated into the functional currency at
     actual rates of the transaction day monetary assets and liabilities are translated at yearend rates non
     monetary assets and liabilities that are stated at historical cost are translated at actual rates of the trans
     action day nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are stated at fair value are translated at the rate
     at the date the values are determined exchange differences arising on the translation are included in the
     income statement

changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement as part of financial income or
expenses all derivatives with a positive fair value would be disclosed as derivative assets and included in
the line financial investments on the balance sheet while all derivatives with a negative fair value would
be disclosed as derivative liabilities and included in the line other liabilities

impairment of financial assets
if there is any indication that a financial asset loans and receivables or financial assetsinvestments avail
able for sale may be impaired its recoverable amount is calculated the recoverable amount of the groups
loans and receivables is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
original effective interest rate inherent in the asset receivables with a short duration are not discounted

trade receivables are reported at their anticipated recoverable amounts the allowance for bad debts is de
termined based on an individual basis or on a portfolio basis where there is objective evidence that impair
ment losses have been incurred the allowance account is used to record impairment losses unless the group
is satisfied that no recovery of the amount due is possible at that point the amount considered unrecover
able is written off against the financial assets directly

86   consolidated financial statements 2015       notes to the consolidated financial statements




     if an assets recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount the asset is written down to its recoverable
     amount all subsequent impairment losses after reversing previous revaluations recognised in other compre
     hensive income of available for sale equity securities are recognised in the income statement

     an impairment loss in respect of a financial asset is reversed if there is a subsequent increase in recoverable
     amount that can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised
     reversals of impairment losses are recognised in the income statement with the exception for reversals of
     impairment losses on available for sale equity securities for which any reversals are recognised in other
     comprehensive income

     property plant and equipment are included in the consolidated financial statements at cost less accumu
     lated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses the depreciation is calculated on a straight line
     basis considering the expected useful life of the individual assets the estimated useful lives for the major

     if parts of an item of property plant and equipment have different useful lives they are accounted for as
     separate items of property plant and equipment subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is prob
     able that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the
     item can be measured reliably all other expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as
     incurred

     8       leases
     leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset to the group
     are classified as finance leases other leases are classified as operating leases

     assets leased under finance leases are included at the present value of the future minimum lease payments
     or their fair value if lower less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses if there is a
     reasonable certainty that the group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term leased assets are

               consolidated financial statements 2015          notes to the consolidated financial statements     87




depreciated over their useful life otherwise leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term
and their useful life the interest portion of the lease payments is expensed through the income statement
based on the effective interest rate inherent in the lease

operating lease payments are treated as operating cost and charged to the income statement on a straight
line basis over the lease period unless another basis is more appropriate to reflect the pattern of benefits to
be derived from the leased asset

any gain or loss from sale and leaseback transactions resulting in operating leases is taken directly to
the income statement if the transaction is established at fair value if the transaction is established below
fair value any loss that is compensated by future lease payments at below market price is deferred and
amortised over the length of the period the asset is expected to be used any other loss is recognised in the
income statement immediately if the transaction is established above fair value the gain arising from the
transaction is deferred and amortised over the period the asset is expected to be used if the fair value at
the time of the sale and leaseback transaction is less than the carrying amount of the asset a loss equal to
the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value is recognised immediately

9       intangibles

goodwill
all business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method goodwill arising from
an acquisition represents the fair value of the consideration transferred including the fair value of any
previously held equity interest in the acquiree and the recognised amount of any noncontrolling interests
in the acquiree less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units

goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses goodwill is tested annually for impairment
at yearend however if there is an indication that goodwill could be impaired at any other point in time
an impairment test is performed

other intangibles
other identifiable intangibles ie software customer lists customer contracts etc purchased from third
parties or acquired in a business combination are separately recognised as intangibles and are stated at
cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses intangibles acquired in a business
combination are recognised separately from goodwill if they are subject to contractual or legal rights or are
separately transferable software is amortised over its estimated useful life three years maximum other
intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life up to ten years maximum
as of december 31 2015 and 2014 there are no intangibles with indefinite useful life recognised in the
groups balance sheet

88   consolidated financial statements 2015       notes to the consolidated financial statements




     10       c ash and c ash equivalents
     cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and in hand as well as shortterm deposits and highly
     liquid investments with a term of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convert
     ible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value for the
     purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement cash and cash equivalents consist also of bank overdrafts
     that are repayable on demand as they are forming an integral part of the groups cash management

     11       impairment of nonfinancial assets
     the carrying amounts of the groups investments in associates and joint ventures its intangibles and
     property plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any
     indication of impairment if any such indication exists the assets recoverable amount is estimated goodwill
     is tested for impairment every year an impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an
     asset or its cashgenerating unit exceeds its recoverable amount

     calculation of a recoverable amount
     the recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use
     in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre
     tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
     to the asset for an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows the recoverable amount is
     determined for the cashgenerating unit the asset belongs to

     reversals of impairment losses
     an impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in respect to other assets an impairment loss is
     reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount an impairment
     loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
     would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised

     12        share c apital

     shares
     incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of shares and share options are recognised as a deduction
     from equity

     treasury shares
     when share capital recognised as equity is repurchased the amount of the consideration paid which
     includes directly attributable costs net of any tax effects is recognised as a deduction from equity
     repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity
     when treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently the amount received is recognised as an increase in
     equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred tofrom the share premium

                consolidated financial statements 2015          notes to the consolidated financial statements         89




13       provisions
provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past
event if it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount
of the obligation can be estimated reliably if the effect is material provisions are determined by discounting
the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and where appropriate the risks specific to the liability a provision is classified in noncurrent liabili
ties in case the expected timing of the payment of the amounts provided for is more than one year

14      pension pl ans severance payments and sharebased compensation pl ans
some consolidated companies maintain pension plans in favour of their personnel in addition to the legally
required social insurance schemes the pension plans partly exist as independent trusts and are operated
either under a defined contribution or a defined benefit plan

defined benefit plans
the aggregate of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for
each plan is recorded in the balance sheet as net defined benefit liability or net defined benefit asset
the discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on aa creditrated bonds that have maturity dates
approximating the terms of the groups obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which
benefits are expected to be paid the calculation is performed by an independent qualified actuary using
the projected unit credit method

all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans are recognised immediately in other compre
hensive income

defined contribution plans
obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the income statement
as an expense in the periods during which services are rendered by the employees

severance payments
the group provides severance benefits to employees as legally required in certain countries which are
accounted for as defined benefit plans

sharebased compensation plans

share matching plan smp
the company introduced a sharebased compensation plan effective august 7 2012 referred to as share
matching plan smp that replaced the share purchase and option plan spop implemented in 2001
this longterm incentive plan allows selected employees of the group to acquire shares of the company with
a discount compared to the actual share price at a specified date such shares are blocked for three years
give its holder immediate voting rights and rights to receive dividends

90   consolidated financial statements 2015      notes to the consolidated financial statements




     for each share purchased the company will match additional shares upon completion of a three years
     vesting period and service condition during the same period the level of the share match share match
     ratio is defined based on the performance of the group achieved over the three financial years in the
     vesting period against defined targets

     when employees purchase shares at a discounted price the difference between the fair value of the shares
     at purchase date and the purchase price of the shares is recognised as a personnel expense with a corre
     sponding increase in equity the fair value of the shares granted is measured at the market price of
     the companys shares

     the fair value of shares matched under the smp is recognised as a personnel expense with a corresponding
     increase in equity the fair value of matched shares is equal to the market price at grant date reduced by
     the present value of the expected dividends during the vesting period and recognised as personnel expense
     over the relevant vesting periods the amount expensed is adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of
     vesting

     share purchase and option plan spop
     the groups previous share purchase and option plan was discontinued as of july 1 2012 it allowed selected
     employees of the group to acquire shares of the company at a reduced price at a specified date such shares
     are blocked for three years give its holder immediate voting rights and rights to receive dividends for each
     share purchased under this plan the company granted two options to the participants each option entitled
     the participant to purchase one share of the company at a predefined price upon completion of the three
     years vesting period and service condition during the same period

     when employees purchase shares at a discounted price the difference between the fair value of the shares at
     purchase date and the purchase price of the shares is recognised as a personnel expense with a correspond
     ing increase in equity the fair value of the shares granted is measured at the market price of the companys
     shares

     the fair value of options granted under spop was recognised as a personnel expense with a corresponding
     increase in equity the fair value of the granted options was calculated using the lattice binomial model

                consolidated financial statements 2015         notes to the consolidated financial statements         91




15     revenue recognition
the company generates its revenues from four principal services 1 seafreight 2 airfreight 3 overland
and 4 contract logistics revenues reported in each of these reportable segments include revenues
generated from the principal service as well as revenues generated from services like customs clearance
export documentation import documentation doortodoor service and management of complex logistics
supply movement that are incidental to the principal service

in seafreight airfreight and overland the group generates the majority of its revenues by purchasing trans
portation services from direct assetbased carriers and selling a combination of those services to its customers
in its capacity of arranging carrier services the group issues a contract of carriage to customers revenues
related to shipments are recognised according to the terms in the contract of carriage revenues from other
services including providing services at destination are recognised when the service is rendered

in contract logistics the principal services are related to customer contracts for warehousing and distribu
tion activities based on the customer contracts revenues are recognised when the service is rendered

a better indication of performance in the logistics industry compared to the turnover is the gross profit the
gross profit represents the difference between the turnover and the cost of services rendered by third parties
for all reportable segments

16      interest expenses and income
interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method

borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to an acquisition construction or production of a qualify
ing asset are recognised in the income statement by using the effective interest method the group has not
capitalised any borrowing costs as it does not have any qualifying assets

17      income taxes
income tax on earnings for the year comprises current and deferred tax both current and deferred tax are
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that the tax relates to business combinations or
items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income

current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year using tax
rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable for
previous years

92   consolidated financial statements 2015         notes to the consolidated financial statements




     deferred tax is recognised based on the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences between
     the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax base the follow
     ing temporary differences are not accounted for initial recognition of goodwill initial recognition of assets
     or liabilities that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to investments in sub
     sidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future the amount of deferred
     tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets
     and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date

     a deferred tax asset in respect of temporary differences or unused tax losses is recognised only to the extent
     that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised deferred
     tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised

     18        noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations
     noncurrent assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be
     recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than from continuing use the asset or disposal
     group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale must be highly probable
     immediately before classification as held for sale the measurement of the assets and all assets and
     liabilities in a disposal group is updated in accordance with applicable ifrs then on initial classification
     as held for sale noncurrent assets and disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and
     fair value less costs to sell impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale are included in the
     income statement intangible assets and property plant and equipment once classified as held for sale are
     not amortised or depreciated

     a discontinued operation is a component of the groups business that represents a separate major line
     of business or geographical area of operations or is a company acquired exclusively with a view to resale
     classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or if earlier when the operation meets the
     criteria to be classified as held for sale

19     segment reporting

a reportable segments
the group provides integrated logistics solutions across customers supply chains using its global logistics
network

the four reportable segments seafreight airfreight overland and contract logistics reflect the internal
management and reporting structure to the management board the chief operating decision maker codm
and are managed through specific organisational structures the codm reviews internal management
reports on a monthly basis each segment is a distinguishable business unit and is engaged in providing and
selling discrete products and services

the discrete distinction between seafreight airfreight and overland is the usage of the same transportation
mode within a reportable segment in addition to common business processes and management routines a
single main transportation mode is used within a reportable segment for the reportable segment contract
logistics the services performed are related to customer contracts for warehouse and distribution activities
whereby services performed are storage handling and distribution

pricing between segments is determined on an arms length basis the accounting policies of the reportable
segments are the same as applied in the consolidated financial statements

information about the reportable segments is presented on the next pages segment performance is based
on ebit as reviewed by the codm the column eliminations shows the eliminations of turnover and
expenses between segments all operating expenses are allocated to the segments and included in the ebit

b geographical information
the group operates on a worldwide basis in several geographical areas until december 31 2014 the geo
graphical information of the group was divided into four regions namely europe americas asiapacific and
middle east central asia and africa as of january 1 2015 the kuehne  nagel group has amended the
reporting structure the former regions europe and middle east central asia and africa are now reported as
one region emea

all products and services are provided in each of these three regions emea americas and asiapacific the
regional revenue is based on the geographical location of the customers invoiced and regional assets are
based on the geographical location of assets

to facilitate comparability between the years 2014 geographical information has been restated

c major customers
there is no single customer who represents more than 10 per cent of the groups total revenue

      impairment testing of goodwill
      the group has performed impairment tests of goodwill at the end of the financial years 2015 and 2014
      for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units which are expected
      to benefit from the synergies of the corresponding business combination the goodwill impairment test is
      performed at the level of a cashgenerating unit or a group of cashgenerating units represented by a
      business unit in the respective country the allocation of goodwill to reportable segments business units
      and geographical regions is further illustrated in note 19

      for the goodwill allocated to the cashgenerating units the impairment tests are based on calculations of
      value in use cash flow projections are based on actual operating results and three year business plans
      cash flows beyond the three year period are extrapolated by using estimated longterm growth rates the
      growth rates do not exceed the longterm average growth rate for the logistics industry in which the cash
      generating units operate future cash flows are discounted based on the weighted average cost of capital
      wacc taking into account risks that are specific to the cashgenerating units

      key assumptions have not changed compared to the previous year with the exception of discount rates
      used for both 2015 and 2014 all recoverable amounts exceeded their carrying amounts and consequently
      no impairment of goodwill was recognised for the years 2015 and 2014

      management considers that it is not likely for the assumptions used to change so significantly as to elimi
      nate the excess of recoverable amounts a sensitivity analysis for the four major acquisitions  usco group

no trade receivables are pledged in 2015 and 2014

the group has a credit insurance programme in place covering trade receivables focusing mainly on small
and medium exposures the credit insurance policy covers up to 80 per cent of the approved customer credit
limit excluding any items being more than 120 days past due as a company policy the group excludes
customers from its insurance programme based on certain criteria socalled blue chip companies

the group establishes an impairment allowance that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of
trade receivables the two components of this impairment allowance of chf 71 million 2014 chf 86 million
are

 specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposure
 collective loss component based on historical experience

trade receivables with credit insurance cover are not included in the impairment allowance the individual
impairment allowance relates to specifically identified customers representing extremely high risk of being
declared bankrupt chapter 11 customers in the usa and customers operating with significant financial dif
ficulties such as negative equity the impairment allowance for individually significant exposures is
chf 42 million at yearend 2015 2014 chf 55 million

the collective impairment allowance based on overdue trade receivables is estimated considering statistical
information of past payment experience the group has established a collective impairment allowance of
chf 29 million 2014 chf 31 million which represents 23 per cent 2014 25 per cent of total outstanding
trade receivables excluding trade receivables with insurance cover see above and trade receivables included
in the individual impairment allowance

the majority of the trade receivables not past due relates to customers who have good payment records with
the group and are subject to yearly credit risk assessments therefore the group does not believe that an
additional impairment allowance for these trade receivables is necessary

or financial position changes in interest rates may cause variations in interest income and expenses resulting
from interestbearing assets and liabilities interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash
flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates loans and investments

      exposure
      the groups exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the groups bank loans and finance lease
      liabilities and to the groups investments of its excess funds the groups exposure to changes in interest
      rates is limited due to the shortterm nature of investments of excess funds and borrowings the group
      does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate risk in respect of investments of
      excess funds or loans

      profile
      at the reporting date the interest profile of the groups interestbearing financial assets and liabilities was
      as follows

      ments a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have increased or decreased profit or loss
      significantly

      cash flow sensitivity analysis  variable rate instruments
      a change of 100 basis points in interest rates on december 31 2015 would have increased or decreased
      profit or loss by chf 8 million 2014 chf 11 million due to changed interest payments on variable rate

      exchange rates of mainly eur usd and gbp on sales purchases investments in debt securities and borrow
      ings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the group entities
      monthly intercompany payments are conducted through a group clearing system in eur and usd which

it is considered that the credit insurance is sufficient to cover potential credit risk concentrations for additional
information refer to note 30

investments of excess funds
the group considers its credit risk to be minimal in respect of investments made of excess funds invested in
shortterm deposits with a maturity of less than three months and in debt securities with firstclass financial
institutions and countries with the close coordination and management of centralised corporate treasury
function the group does not invest in equity securities

liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulties to meet obligations associated with its
financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset group companies require
sufficient availability of cash to meet their obligations individual companies are generally responsible for
their own cash management including the shortterm investment of cash surplus and the raising of loans to
cover cash deficits subject to guidance by the group and in certain cases to approval at group level the
group maintains sufficient reserves of cash to meet its liquidity requirements at all times

      it is not expected that the cash flow included in the above maturity analysis could occur at significantly
      different points in time or at significantly different amounts

      48        fair value of financial assets and liabilities
      the fair values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are approximately equal to the
      carrying amounts

      cash and cash equivalents with a carrying amount of chf 841 million 2014 chf 1170 million as well as
      financial assets with a carrying amount of chf 2567 million 2014 chf 2702 million classified as loans
      and receivables carried at amortised cost are all classified as current assets

      the group has financial liabilities with a carrying amount of chf 2465 million 2014 chf 2606 million
      carried at amortised cost the majority of these financial liabilities are current liabilities at yearend 2015

      as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the group holds no debt instruments designated as financial assets at
      fair value through profit or loss and no significant derivative instruments

      the groups financial instruments measured at fair value have been categorised into below mentioned levels
      reflecting the significance of inputs used in estimating fair values

       level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical instruments
       level 2 i nput other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the instrument
                 either directly or indirectly
       level 3 valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs

      the fair value of the derivative instruments forward foreign exchange contracts is determined based on
      current and available market data pricing models commonly used in the market are applied taking into
      account relevant parameters such as forward rates spot rates discount rates yield curves and volatility

      50       accounting estimates and judgments
      the management has carefully considered the development selection and disclosure of the groups critical
      accounting policies and estimates as well as the application of these policies and estimates

      acquisition accounting
      intangible assets acquired in a business combination are required to be recognised separately from goodwill
      and amortised over their useful life if they are subject to contractual or legal rights or are separately
      transferable the group has separately recognised customer contractslists trademarks and field office sales
      contracts in acquisitions made see note 27

      the fair value of these acquired intangible assets is based on valuation techniques which require input
      based on assumptions about the future the management uses its best knowledge to estimate fair value of
      acquired intangible assets as of the acquisition date the value of intangible assets is tested for impairment
      when there is an indication that they might be impaired see below the management must also make
      assumptions about the useful life of the acquired intangible assets which might be affected by external
      factors such as increased competition

      carrying amount of goodwill other intangibles and property plant and equipment
      the group tests its goodwill with a total carrying amount of chf 767 million 2014 chf 695 million for
      impairment every year as disclosed in note 11 no impairment loss on goodwill was recognised in 2015
      and 2014 the group also assesses annually whether there is any indication that other intangible assets
      or property plant and equipment may be impaired in such a case the assets are tested for impairment
      no impairment loss on other intangible assets was recognised in 2015 2014 nil the carrying amount of
      other intangibles is chf 98 million 2014 chf 49 million and that of property plant and equipment is
      chf 1142 million 2014 chf 1175 million

      impairment tests are based on valueinuse calculations which involve a variety of assumptions such as
      estimates of future cash inflows and outflows and choice of a discount rate actual cash flows might for
      example differ significantly from managements current best estimate changes in market environment
      evolution of technologies etc might have an impact on future cash flows and result in recognition of
      impairment losses

      defined benefit pension plans
      the group has recognised a liability for defined benefit pension plans in the amount of chf 346 million
      2014 chf 409 million a number of assumptions are made in order to calculate the liability including
      discount rate and future salary increases a relatively minor change in any of these assumptions can have a
      significant impact on the carrying amount of the defined benefit obligation

      sharebased compensation plans
      judgment and estimates are required when determining the expected share match ratio at each yearend
      the variance between estimated and actual share match ratio might have an impact on the amount
      recognised as personnel expense see note 36 for more information

                                                     consolidated financial statements 2015        other notes    139




accrued trade expenses and deferred income
freight forwarding transactions which are completed and for which the costs are not fully received are
accrued for expected costs based on best estimate for transactions which are not complete on account of
pending service at cutoff date or transactions for which revenue is earned and relevant costs can not be
estimated the related revenue is deferred the group managements judgment is involved in the estimate of
costs and deferral of revenue and their completeness

income tax
judgment and estimates are required when determining deferred as well as current tax assets and liabilities
the management believes that its estimates based on for example interpretation of tax laws are reasonable
changes in tax laws and rates interpretations of tax laws earnings before tax taxable profit etc might have
an impact on the amounts recognised as tax assets and liabilities

the group has recognised a net deferred tax asset of chf 49 million 2014 net deferred tax asset of
chf 89 million furthermore the group has unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to unused tax
losses of chf 37 million 2014 chf 55 million based on estimates of the probability of realising these
tax benefits available taxable temporary differences periods of reversals of such differences etc the
management does not believe that the criteria to recognise deferred tax assets are met see note 24

provisions and contingent liabilities
the group has recognised provisions for an amount of chf 160 million 2014 chf 130 million related to
legal claims and other exposures in the freight forwarding and logistics operations see note 40 the
provisions represent the best estimate of the risks but the final amount required is subject to uncertainty

51        post bal ance sheet events
on february 29 2016 the european general court in first instance confirmed to uphold the decision of
the european commission regarding the subject matter of kuehne  nagels appeal against the antitrust
fine of chf 65 million eur 537 million imposed in 2012 kuehne  nagel is considering an appeal to
the european court of justice
