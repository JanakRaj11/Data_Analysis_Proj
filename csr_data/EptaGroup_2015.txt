   a letter from the managing director
    we believe that the csr report must hold a central place in our group philosophy it is
an important step that represents a consistent and universal expression of the principles and
values that underlie our style as a company and it has to be addressed with real determination
it is thus our great pleasure to inform you that we are continuing down the path we started
four years ago by creating the 2015 edition of our csr this confirms our will and our focus on
sustainabilityoriented social progress
    this is a very important decision our approach aims not only at communicating and bearing
witness to what we have already accomplished but is a commitment to do even better
    creating sustainable values is a concept that makes us think and dream it makes us think
because being sustainable means to be able to stand the test of time an approach
reflecting the origins of the companies that have merged into our group with almost
one century of commitment of care for the customer the products corporate staff and all
corporate stake holders this extensive background incorporates eptas will to be a group that
becomes stronger and greater over time
    that also leaves room for dreams because being sustainable also means to give more
than we get to build a greater presence and a more widely shared social progress and
dreams make us imagine and create a better world
    we strongly believe that committing to research and to the creation of solutions that optimise
the utilisation of natural energy sources should be a founding policy for every industrial
organisation in the past three years we have reached and even exceeded the important
goals that we set for ourselves
    1 we have reached more than 50 of energy saving products in our range
    2 we have chosen sustainability aware suppliers this decision has made it possible to
reach another goal increasing the use of renewablesource electrical energy up to 33
epta exceeded this goal in 2014 by reaching 36 just as importantly we have reduced energy
consumption in the past three years measured in kilograms of oil equivalent per manufactured
unit this achievement resulted in a 20 reduction exceeding the 5 that we were aiming at
    we are still following our decision to efficiently use energy sources and our goal for the next
three years is a further 5 reduction in energy consumption measured against our output
    year after year these initiatives and objectives will be our guide in improving our performance
and making further progress so that we may exceed the longterm goals that we have set for
ourselves
