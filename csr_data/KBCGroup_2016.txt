directive the markets in financial instruments regulation and the       management group risk and compliance keep close track
insurance distribution directive to protect clients from unfair or       of the rules and propose the necessary responses in
inappropriate practices other regulation relates to the                 terms of the groups capital planning for instance
foundations of the european banking union ie harmonised              in the case of regulations that will have a major impact on
supervision by the european central bank of the most important           us such as solvency ii and ifrs 9 internal programmes

in the basel regulations for banks and the introduction of the           analyse draft texts
solvency ii directive for insurers with effect from 2016 the bank      memorandums are produced and training provided for
recovery and resolution directive brrd which includes the             the business side to raise awareness of the forthcoming
introduction of resolution instruments such as bailins and the          regulations
associated mrel requirements is also important it is designed to
ensure that investors rather than governments have to absorb
losses incurred by banks another factor is the new ifrs that
have yet to become effective including ifrs 4 applies specifically
to the insurance business and especially ifrs 9 introduces a
number of measures including a new classification system for
financial instruments and new impairment rules

                                  we have been a pioneer in our core markets ever since kbc asset management
                                  launched its first sri funds in 1992 the first generation of funds worked on an
                                  exclusion basis ie the funds in question did not invest in companies belonging to
                                  morally questionable sectors the second generation concentrated on positive
                                  criteria ie on companies that have a positive impact on society mostly with an
                                  ecological focus the current generation of sri funds takes account not only of
                                  ecological criteria but also of social impact and corporate governance and of the
                                  various stakeholders the funds only invest in companies that are among the best in
                                  their sector in terms of sustainability impact investing is the latest trend in sri this
                                  form of investing bridges the gap between traditional investments which focus on
                                  financial returns and philanthropy which does not expect a financial return by

our three lines of defence model
                              the business operations side is fully responsible for all the risks in its area of activity and has to
   1
                              ensure that effective controls are in place
 the business itself          in so doing it ensures that the right controls are performed in the right way that selfassessment of
                              the business side is of a sufficiently high standard that there is adequate awareness of risk and that
                              sufficient prioritycapacity is allocated to risk themes

                              independent of the business side the secondline risk and control functions formulate their own

                              opinion regarding the risks confronting kbc in this way they provide an adequate degree of
 the risk function           certainty that the firstline control function is keeping these risks under control without taking over
 compliance and  for        primary responsibility from the first line in this regard the secondline functions are tasked to
 certain matters             identify measure and report risks the risk function has a veto right to ensure that it is respected
 finance legal and tax      the secondline risk and control functions also support the consistent implementation of the risk
 and information risk         policy the risk framework etc throughout the group and supervise how they are applied
 security                     compliance is an independent function that aims to prevent kbc from being exposed to compliance

                              it pays particular attention in this regard to compliance with the integrity policy

 internal audit               control and risk management system including risk policy are effective and efficient and to ensure
                              that policy measures and processes are in place and consistently applied within the group to

        a shares in the trading book 04 billion euros are excluded above but are included in the table in note 18
        b real estate participations that are not consolidated are classified as investments in building in this table but classified as shares in the table in note 18 as they are not consolidated
        c most investments in funds are treated on a lookthrough basis according to the underlying asset mix of the fund and therefore also partially classified as fixedincome instruments

                               and against inhouse solvency targets hence
                               capital adequacy is approached from both a

   company do not differ much from the accrued interest expense and accrued interest income as most rate products pay interest regularly within the year

segment reporting
prior to yearend 2014 we provided adjusted figures alongside the
figures according to ifrs to give more insight into the ongoing business
performance as a consequence a number of nonoperating items
legacy cdo activities legacy business of divestment companies and
the impact of changes in the fair value of own debt instruments due to
own credit risk were not recognised in the income statement but were
summarised instead in three lines at the bottom of the presentation
and the belgium business units trading results were recognised under
net result from financial instruments at fair value segment reporting
was based entirely on these adjusted results a detailed definition of
adjusted results can be found in our 2014 annual report


we scrapped the adjusted results with effect from 2015  with
retroactive application to the 2014 figures for purposes of comparison
 because the nonoperating items had become immaterial
divestments completed cdo exposure fully scaled back and because
it substantially simplified our financial reporting as of this report
therefore the segment data is based entirely on ifrs data moreover
we no longer split up the group centre into group centre excl
intersegment eliminations and intersegment eliminations in
accordance with internal reporting to management also with
retroactive application for 2014


it should be noted that
 in principle we assign a group company in its entirety to one specific
  segment see note 44 major exceptions are only made for those
  items that cannot clearly be allocated to a specific segment such as
  charges attached to the subordination of loans such items are
  recognised under group centre
 we allocate the funding cost of participating interests to the group
  centre any funding cost in respect of leveraging at kbc group nv
  level is also recognised under group centre
 transactions among the different segments are reported at arms

 financial assets are past due if a counterparty fails to make a payment     due but that does not mean that other loans to this counterparty are
  at the time agreed in the contract the concept of past due applies       considered past due financial assets that are 90 days or more past
  to a contract not to a counterparty for example if a counterparty        due are always considered impaired
  fails to make a monthly repayment the entire loan is considered past
