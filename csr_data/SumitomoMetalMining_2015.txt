                                                         in fiscal 2014 we succeeded in posting

                                                         owes greatly to the shift to full production

    the environment we find ourselves in today         the safety of our employees themselves but
isnt altogether a favorable one on the plus          also to ensure that their families can live with
side the weak yen continues to provide a              full peace of mind the same is true of our
welcome tail wind but metal prices are unlikely       relationship with the local community wherever
to rise substantially at least through the near       we engage in mining smelting or refining we
term and for that reason we will need to              always put down roots and undertake activities
strengthen our earning capacity regardless of          fitting the specific local situation we have
what is taking place in our external environment      created scholarship programs for example
    one major issue is the increasing severity         and at taganito hpal and coral bay nickel we
we are seeing today in the environment                 have supported the construction and operation
surrounding resource development                      of schools and health clinics
an outgrowth for example of resource                     in developing the sierra gorda copper
nationalism in some countries we are also            mine to protect the local environment we
facing longer development periods and                  secure the water we need for the mines
expanding costs and because of these                  operation by bringing seawater to the site
trends we will need to exercise even greater           by pipeline  a distance of more than 100
cautiousness in managing project risks in             kilometers in this way our growth strategies
the coming years i believe strengthening               are intimately and inseparably intertwined with
our relationships of trust with the countries          the strengthening of our management base
and regions where we undertake projects               through csr and other initiatives
and securing infrastructure that addresses
environmental and regional needs will also
become more important than ever                             how would you describe the
                                                             essence of the smm groups csr

      what points will be of greatest

to achieve our longterm vision i think two            are indispensable to society and as a
things will be necessary growth strategies to         company whose business is monozukuri 
enhance our earning capacity and continuous           manufacturing  i believe the smm groups
strengthening of our management base                  greatest social responsibility is to stably
particularly in the cases of mineral resources         supply its customers with the products society
and smelting  refining these are businesses          requires also at the very minimum we have
that involve lengthy time spans a single project      a responsibility to perform monozukuri in
can take decades to carry out developing              harmony with society with local communities
resources equates to community development             and with the environment
 development undertaken with the local                    for these reasons in the smm group
community a project cant go forward if the           undertaking csr activities is nothing out of the
company undertaking it fails to win the trust          ordinary on the contrary all our employees
of the local people this is why its absolutely       put csr into practice every day in the regular
necessary for us to enhance the quality of our         performance of their work and now as our
management from a broad perspective and               business steadily expands worldwide a global
build up our management base in a way that             approach to csr is also of critical importance
will foster trust                                         earlier as a group we have hoisted our
    through our history stretching back over           vision for 2020 describing the future image
more than 400 years the smm group has                 we should target in our csr activities and this
learned the importance of being a company              past year we reviewed its contents in light of
that is trusted a stance that has been passed         changes in the social picture we also made
down through the years in the sumitomo                 the targets and progress of this initiative more
business spirit to cite an example consider          readily understandable by establishing key
the matter of employee safety in the smm              performance indicators disclosing materiality
group we believe its crucial not only to ensure       and so forth

              in recent years the concept of diversity is        concerned its important to raise our roe
              garnering a great deal of attention its only       an indicator of capital efficiency of course
              natural that when you attempt to do business         but at companies like ours that undertake
              in a different country region or culture clashes   resource development requiring a long time
              of various kinds can occur and this holds true      span roa a measure of asset efficiency is
              of coexisting with local communities also         also an extremely important factor i intend to
              whats important is to have respect for your         clearly convey detailed information of this kind
              mutual differences in that sense its extremely     to our investors to carry out our responsibility
              important to develop human resources who             in terms of accountability
              embrace such an approach to others
                   when developing human resources i
              think its important to encourage faceto                 in the longrange view what will
              face dialogue email and telephone can                     be the companys strategies and
              often suffice to convey what needs to be

              message truly comes across also important i        direction in our next 3year business plan
              think is the chitchat you make with people       which is set to start in fiscal 2016 we will
              on occasions like that casual talk on topics        focus our total efforts on achieving the targets
              unrelated to everyday work as an example            annual production volumes and the like 
              we often learn or realize things in the course of    hoisted in our longterm vision

              an article on economic matters that appeared         position that our three core businesses

     effective use of resources is therefore considered an important    previously been converted into resources such as lowgrade
     managerial issue as we seek sustainable business development      and hardtoprocess ores we are also endeavoring to refine
     based on this understanding the smm group has included            technologies for recovering valuable metals including copper
     effective use of resources as one of its six key csr areas       and precious metals from items such as used home appliances
     and is advancing recycling efforts as stated in our vision for    and electronic devices as we develop valuablemetal recovery
     2020 we strive to be a company that generates resources using    technologies for recycling nickel etc from used batteries
