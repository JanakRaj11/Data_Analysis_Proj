 providing online convenience

  using twitter to provide active support
 the proliferation of smartphones and the surge in use of social
 networking services sns has enabled customers to express their
 problems and dissatisfaction via tweets and made them increasingly
 visible
      we don t simply wait for customers to make a telephone inquiry
 or come along to an au shop for a consultation we use twitter  a
 particularly prolific sns  to provide active support by proactively
 searching for problems and dissatisfaction one approach that has
 led to helping us to resolve issues among customers who tweet but
 in an offhand manner without really intending to ask for help has
 been to respond with our own tweet saying we saw your tweet we
 may be able to help you so could you provide us with more details
 using an open forum like sns allows us to simultaneously address
 areas that many people may find problematic or dissatisfying we
 have received strong positive feedback outside of the company for
 this initiative

the csr procurement questionnaire is just a process for                                                                and our approach to csr procurement

the promotion of green procurement can inspire suppliers to develop technology leading to new                         activities of competitors to promote the incorporation of csr procurement into the company s
  innovations and stronger competitiveness even though it may be more expensive to use ecofriendly                    management policy it is important to deepen the conversation at the management level efforts toward

 stakeholder dialogues
                              deepening csr procurement and green procurement efforts at kddi




 in response to the dialogue
we regularly visit the suppliers but due to limited
  resources our challenge is to determine whether to look
  one two three or more levels into the supply chain first
  we place priority on the primary suppliers and work to
  ensure that the large risks have been eliminated
in conducting audits and improving the issues that
  are identified a very important aspect is to establish a
  relationship of trust with suppliers and listen to their opinions while pursuing our efforts this has been our
  approach up to now even for conventional purchasing activities and we will continue implementing this
  approach moving forward
kddi has implemented a process for procuring energyefficient power supply equipment and air
  conditioning equipment based on the kddi green procurement guidelines but we have not introduced
  a similar process for communication devices due to cost we recognize the need to review the guideline
  standards and make further efforts
we recognize the need for management to deepen their consideration of csr procurement as a company
  wide issue and we have reaffirmed the importance of working with business partners to make continuous
  stepbystep improvements with respect to each issue for the actual products at the actual sites moving
  forward kddi will continue making efforts to thoroughly implement the pdca cycle and steadily resolve
  issues one by one

 green road project

  promoting recycling of mobile phones
 used mobile phone handsets that have been collected from customers
 at au shops are manually disassembled separating out substrates
 displays cameras plastics screws iron antennas motors speakers
 and other items in a secured room gold silver copper palladium and
 other resources are extracted from the substrates while screws and
 antennas are recycled into steel products and plastics are recycled into
 plastic products when a machine is used to disassemble a mobile
 phone plastics are burned up in the incineration process and so
 cannot be used as a recycled resource in addition recycling eliminates
 the need to conduct new mining and refining of mineral resources
 such as oil iron gold silver and copper while also reducing the
 amount of carbon dioxide that is generated through the mining and
 refining processes kddi performs all disassembly manually to prevent
 recyclable resources from being wasted

 visible progress in terms of performance in particular the proactive      issues as one of japan s key telecommunications companies there
 hardware and software support for social issues that are unique to          are expectations for kddi s practical capabilities
 the mobile phone business can be evaluated positively the diversity
 efforts can also be evaluated positively particularly the achievement of
 the target to promote 90 females to line managers 7 share of total
 that contribute to decisionmaking processes as well as the newly
 established target of having 200 female line managers by fy2020
 also i think this is well understood but care needs to be taken so as
 not to equate the diversity problem with the gender problem
     in terms of the relationship with governance the human rights
 panel and environmental panel were newly established as subsidiary
 groups under the csr committee however to prevent damage to
 the corporate value and to improve the power of the kddi brand it is
 not enough to simply provide reports in the management meetings
 there also needs to be proactive discussions in those meetings esg
 investors might also request those reports to help in their decision
 making processes
     as stated in the message from the president the growth strategy
 aims to transform kddi from a telecommunications company into a
 life design company as a longterm vision this is not something
 that can be achieved within the context of a 3year mediumterm
 management objective with 2015 being recognized as the first year
 of sustainability for the global environment and society megatrends
 in the business environment are undergoing radical changes that
 will render conventional business models unsuitable it is essential

            limited level of assurance and at a materiality of the professional judgment of the verifier

            lrqas opinion
            based on lrqas approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe
            that the total ghg emissions disclosed in the report as summarized in table 1 below are
            not materially correct and the report has not been prepared in conformance with the
            organisations inhouse reporting procedures

            lrqas recommendations
            the organisation should continue improving the quality assurance and control systems with
            internal selfverification particularly across its group companies in japan and overseas
