our philosophy



oxyfuel combustion technology employs environment
friendly process for the melting of glass in this method a
pair of auxiliary oxyfuel burners is installed in an airfired
furnace to accelerate the melting and fining rate in most
furnaces glass pull rate increases to about 10 to 30 as
compared with only air firing in an oxyfuelfired furnace
the temperature profile or the heat flux distribution to the
furnace load is relatively easily controlled by the number
and the placement of the oxyfuel burners this flexibility of
placing a flame where it is needed is a major reason
enabling the production rate increase

it aids in improving the furnace energy efficiency
additionally reduced air emissions result in lesser impacts
on the environment

    the fly ash generated from our captive power plants contains
    high carbon content and could not be used for producing fly ash
    based ppc as the quality of fly ash does not conform to bureau of
    indian standard norms secondly during mixing of cement with
    water carbon particles used to float on the surface of water after
    several technical reviews it was identified that if we spray it on the
    hot clinker bed of clinker cooler having bed temperature  750oc
    the carbon particles will burn immediately and fly ash will become
    a part of clinker

and therefore understanding their key concerns and issues
becomes an integral function of our sustainable

and equitable business practices and to accomplish this
engage with our key stakeholders on a regular basis
during the reporting period several workshops were organised in each business unit to identify and
prioritise stakeholder concerns these workshops were attended by all the department heads of our units
and moderated by a third party the exercise helped us formally list all the groups of stakeholders that we
engage with during the regular course of conducting our business we have been using various
engagement methods such as customer satisfaction surveys to gauge valuable feedback that provides us
vital insight into customer requirements and expectations

through the process of prioritisation we have identified our key stakeholder groups as follows
