           largest integrated environmental and geotechnical drilling site
           characterization and remediation partner

            2016 also marks a new beginning in june we introduced a
            brand identity symbolizing our growth and transformation in the

  industry                                            our vision is to
 redesigned our website to deliver valuable           integrate technology
  resources to our stakeholders and open

                                                        facing our clients


                                                                                 3

our business faces a number of risks in the coming year some pose
a significant impact to our future success through the process of
sustainability planning and reporting our senior leadership examines these
risks to determine how to address each and best position the company
to withstand potential effects the most immediate and significant is the
uncertain political climate under a new presidential administration

much of our business is driven by environmental regulation and government
funding of infrastructure projects and environmental remediation the
new administration has alluded to a more lax regulatory framework and a
surge of funding for infrastructure projects weakening of environmental
regulations and funding for cleanups may soften the environmental services
market having a direct negative impact on our environmental drilling and
technical service business lines conversely a boom in infrastructure funding
would drive our geotechnical drilling business

our resources are aligned to manage this risk over the next five years the
vertical integration of services to include environmental and geotechnical
drilling site characterization and environmental remediation diversifies our
risk we are able to partner with our clients to offer innovative solutions to
complex problems from the earliest planning phase to achieving the project
objectives our new operating structure leverages all cascade resources
personnel equipment and technologies as a full service environmental
platform resulting in an agile response to changing market conditions
we will continue to focus on

 maintaining our strict safety standards

 upgrading our fleet with safety and energy efficiency in mind

 recruiting and retaining top talent across all areas of our business

we look forward to continuing the journey with you as our partner over
the next twentyfive years

impact from fuel consumption to greenhouse gas emissions and worker health  safety it is also
the area in which we can have the most significant conservation impact our fleet management
department focuses efforts on improving fuel efficiency and vehicle maintenance providing
wellmaintained equipment not only contributes to a safer working environment but also enables

spills
spills are a real concern on every one of our job sites cascade recognizes that spills of fuel
hydraulic fluids or chemicals may pose a serious threat to human health safety and the
environment equipment failure poses the greatest likelihood of spills for our operations
in order to mitigate the risk of spills cascade focuses first on prevention then on action

we use several procedures to prevent spills or releases to the
ground or surface water while working on project sites these
include but are not limited to
    documented preshift site and equipment inspections                            zero
    site specific spill prevention and response plans                           significant

effects of remediation activities from project planning through design and implementation

we measure cleanup progress in terms of return on remediation investment rori the rori
approach is based on over 20 years of field experience addressing contamination at hundreds of
sites this sustainabilitybased approach reduces total lifecycle remediation costs through site
characterization and remediation best practices it also minimizes the health risks and liabilities
from contaminant source areas and plumes to ultimately achieve unlimited use and unrestricted
exposure remediation objectives
