14 the risk
   management
      statement
      introduction
      for us to enhance share holder value
      pride recognizes that risk management
      remains an integral part of the day to
      day business operations




              a   s such we have developed processes to ensure all major risks are proactively assessed
                  and managed through the 3 lines of defense model upon which all business and
              administrative policies procedures and guidelines are instituted this is achieved through
              upholding the highest standards of integrity and constantly ensuring that sound corporate
              governance principles are upheld at all levels of the organization

              prides enterprise risk management framework builds on optimizing the risk  reward
              strategy leveraging on the risk control awareness culture right from the board executive
              committee of management to the frontline staff and this was fundamental to prides
              achievements in 2016 despite the volatility and uncertainty that characterized the 2016
              business environment

              top risks to pride business in 2016 were highly driven by the political environment given
              the 2016 general elections as well as market dynamics on top the cardinal risk exposures
              of strategic credit  compliance operational information security people and systemic
              risk emerging as critical specifically in the last quarter of the year the emerging power
              of technology in 2016 did not only come with galloping opportunities to the business
              but enhanced social media activity demystified the reputational risks as well as the usual
              systems related risks managing the above exposures therefore called for a resilient and
              scalable risk management framework that is owned by all the stakeholders right from the
              board to the front line staff given the dynamic business environment prides enterprise
              risk management framework had to be aligned to achieve the risk  reward goal

              overview of prides risk governance

                   the board has clearly articulated prides risk control environment aimed at obtaining
                    a risk reward trade off through minimizing threats while maximizing opportunities
                    the boards responsibilities include instituting a scalable enterprise risk management
                    framework that defines prides risk appetite roles and responsibilities of the various
                    parties tools to support the risk management processes and mitigating actions to
                    prides risk profile

                   to underscore prides risk management oversight board has instituted the risk assets
                    liabilities committee while the board audit committee is also in place to provide
                    oversight over prides risk management practices in a way that ensures shareholder
                    value this cascaded to excom level through the management risk assets and liabilities
                    committee


   pride annual report 2016   27

                furthermore at excom level the management credit committee provides valuable
                 oversight of the credit risk management practices ranging from credit approvals in
                 line with the approved limits to monitoring and recommending credit risk policy
                 reviews to board in line with the changing risk profile

                prides risk appetite is clearly defined through the risk appetite statement in the erm
                 framework the risk management processes are coordinated by the risk department
                 which develops and implements the enterprise risk management framework monitors

           several tools as per the entire risk management framework building a risk awareness culture
