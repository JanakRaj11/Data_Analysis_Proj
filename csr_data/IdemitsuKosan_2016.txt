 addressing environmental issues at our refineries and petrochemical plants
we constantly strive to minimize our operations environmental                  in addition we are cooperating in a carbon capture and storage
impact looking to increase efficiency and reduce raw material and          ccs demonstration project that japan ccs co ltd is operating

ties at our refineries and petrochemical plants at facilities built on     ministry of economy trade and industry meti the project is uti
reclaimed coastal land for example we incorporated green spaces           lizing ccs technology that absorbs co2 from gaseous power plant
from the design stage and continually work to ensure that these             emissions before it can be released into the atmosphere pumping
green spaces are maintained and utilized even as the facilities are         it deep underground to sequester it our role in the project is to

  keeping our shortrun of fuel oil supply below total sales                   on a related note as one of two pillars of japans stockpiling
  as surplus refining facilities became a problem idemitsu closed its      strategy the act on oil stockpiling requires primary oil distributors
  hyogo and okinawa refineries in 2003 and 2004 since then the            to maintain separate private oil stocks since 1993 stockpiles are
  companys strategy has been to maintain its refining capacity at a        required to be equivalent to 70 days of normal supply so far japans
  level below its total sales volume and to supplement any supply defi     energy supply has been underpinned by private oil stocks without

         policy since its founding the company is widely rec                  1 we need to leverage our ability to directly connect
         ognized by its apollo logo under which it has estab                     with consumers to ensure service station management
         lished a robust brand network by developing business                      that responds swiftly to environmental changes and
         in cooperation with retail outlets whose management                       meet regional needs
         is strongly rooted in the local community
                                                                                2 given the structural decline in domestic demand ser

         card systems we aim to establish a brand supported                       of meeting this social need is the sparsity of service
         by local communities even as gasoline demand                              stations in some areas some with fewer than three
         declines




  prioritizing consumer benefit
idemitsu started out as a dealer in petroleum products at the            to diesel oil which doesnt hinder engine performance this led to
time it was standard practice for a single dealer to handle an           great results for both our business and the fishing boat operators
entire region although our original line of products was limited to         the distribution system at the time meant fuel oil went from the
lubricants we noted that there were no specified dealers covering        oil company through two to three dealers before reaching the
regions offshore and we used this fact to launch a business direct      consumer for sale idemitsu however created a distribution sys
ly selling fuel oil to fishing boat operators we were able to offer      tem that allowed it to cut out the middleman and conduct retail
fishing boat operators major fuel cost reductions if they were to         operations itself through a single large organization covering an
switch from the kerosene they usually used to power their engines         extensive area


 building a network uniting our retail outlets
the idemitsu groups extensive retail network business model was             our service stations remain important energy bases that support
created by unifying the extended family of idemitsu companies and         local communities like neighborhood doctors but for cars rather
retail outlets to form the idemitsu brand network the extensive          than people these stations are highly regarded by their customers
retail network is a rational efficient business model used to directly   and have promoted activities rooted in local communities that make
connect producers with consumers after world war ii we returned         them trusted and supported by all idemitsu considers its strong ties
to the petroleum industry and despite having built a network of          with retail outlets to be the core of its competitiveness and that
retail outlets faced a great number of challenges in creating an         strengthening this competitiveness will lead to consumer benefit
extensive retail network it was finally made possible thanks to the
presence of retail outlets that shared our belief in respect for human
beings and working together as members of idemitsus extended
family as postwar demand for automobile fuel expanded like
minded retail outlets joined us as business partners to create an
extensive retail network and extend our service station network
   after its launch in 1950 this idea or the idemitsukai concept
spread to our operations in every region of the country providing
a forum of exchange for retail outlet managers these regional
groups later merged to form a single organization covering the
entire nation at the annual joint meeting and idemitsukai
national conference around 1100 retailers and idemitsu associ
ates from around japan gather to affirm policies and activities and
pledge to work in unison to achieve their goals in addition the
idemitsukai has always held regional promotional activities for
idemitsu and promoted regionspecific social contribution its
activities have helped raise our brand value while increasing the         at the exhibit area of the joint meeting service station car care information is

   painter and haiku poet was born in edo and was the younger brother of sakai
   tadazane the lord of himeji castle his early artistic training was with the kano
   school but he later experimented with many different painting styles from a wide              nobuhiko hiromi

the powerful motif offered by a confrontation between the wind and thunder gods fascinated the three painters that respectively represent the
early mid and late edo periods tawaraya sotatsu lived in the first half of the 17th century ogata korin in the first half of the 18th century
and sakai hoitsu the painter of the reproduction shown here in the first half of the 19th century there are some commonalities between the
history of the fujin raijinzu folding screens and the idemitsu groups visionwith respect for human beings at its core the group forms new
traditions through the accumulation of innovation that anticipates the demands of the times
