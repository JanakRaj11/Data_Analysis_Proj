                                     the calsonic kansei group has introduced environmental accounting as a tool for quantitative evalua
                                     tion of environmental activities and official announcements
                                     environmental accounting is a means of publicizing and quantitatively summing up the economic advan
                                     tages accompanying environmental conservation measures as well as the benefits and costs of environ
                                     mental conservation and related activities and what we publicize in the environmental report fulfills our
                                     commitment to explain our business activities to our various stakeholders

                                     establishing a quantitative evaluation summary is helpful for enhancing
                                     our sustainable business management practices
                                     those benefits are summed up quantitatively and announced to society in the form of environmental
                                     accounting through environmental reports evaluation of quantitatively calculated results can also assist
                                     our environmental management practices

   7 efforts to manage chemical substances
substances that could impact the environment are used in some products and for the manufacture of
items designed to improve the quality of these products therefore there are concerns that these sub
stances could have a significant impact on the environment during the manufacture and use of these
products and also when they are discarded
global awareness of the environment is now increasing and more requests to reducestop using these
substances are coming in every year both from home and abroad
in response we are promoting the responsible management of chemical substances environmentally
hazardous substances by adhering to the laws and regulations of each country responding promptly to
our customers requests and setting our own goals voluntarily

the calsonic kansei group is quantitatively evaluating the environmental burden output resulting from
its industrial operations and striving to reduce this burden by gaining a comprehensive understanding of
the impact of all operations
2012 was the last year of the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol 20082012 the japa

pany greatly surpassed the goal by reducing the ghg emissions by 445 in 2012 and 384 on aver
age in the last five years
we promote reduced carbon emissions and reduced emissions per unit from the viewpoint of global
warming and also promote 100 reuse of resources in order to create zero waste from the viewpoint of
the effective use of resources so that our factories can operate in balance with the environment
furthermore in 2012 same as 2011 our concerted efforts called energy saving special activities
greatly surpassed the original targets and promoted our energy management

                                                   we are aiming to reduce co2 emissions per unit by 97 by fy 2016 compared to fy 2005

                                                   in order to achieve the goal described above we targeted a 2 reduction in fy 2012 compared to fy 2011
                                                   by promoting reduction activities a 29 reduction in co2 emissions per unit was achieved

  activities and discussion

although we extracted projects to reduce the amount of waste discharge and implemented the activities to improve the
 situation the amount of waste increased because it was the projects startup period
in the overseas locations where zero emission activities lagged behind we set fy2015 as the deadline to achieve zero
 landfill and promoted activities
calsonic kansei north america lewisburg plant achieved the zero landfill and they received an award from the state of
 tennessee

  activities and discussion

we managed reduced the water usage fee per unit by adopting the measures shown below however the water usage per
