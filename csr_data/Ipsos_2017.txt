acting responsibly towards society and communities



the community pillar of the taking responsibility
structure of ipsos covers both the social and so
ciety aspects of the gri structure the society aspect
of gri is an area that ipsos has fully embraced and
this chapter is intended to highlight the breadth of ac
tivities undertaken by ipsos

3 impact on communities and charity poli
cies

territorial economic and social impact on regional
development and neighboring communities

given the level of decentralisation of its activities and
the geographical dispersion of its staff ipsos has no
significant direct impact on local employment the
direct impact of the economic and social group is
thus that of a multinational company with more than
16000 employees in 88 countries

however we favour the recruitment of local popula
tions in that we believe that their understanding of
the social economic and cultural thematics is a key
success factor of our business with our local clients

engaging with and having active relations with so
cietal and community stakeholders are a key com
ponent of the taking responsibility programme

in a significant proportion of ipsos countries there
are formal policies in place in relation to their cha
rity community and volunteering policies 58 of
surveyed countries are aware of some formal policy
in their country as of 2016 covering social societal
environment ethical and anticorruption policies

the taking responsibility 2016 survey results highlight
the existence of very specific and formal policies co
vering the following range of issues
