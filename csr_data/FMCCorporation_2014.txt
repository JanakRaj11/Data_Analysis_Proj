reflect the 2014 announcement of fmcs intention              of our communities
to separate into two publicly listed companies nor
does it include results from the recently divested
peroxygens business that business became a
discontinued operation in third quarter 2013 and we
have excluded its current and historical data from this
report in doing so we are able to present meaningful
comparisons and align with the ghg initiative
protocol recommendation for handling divestitures
additionally we have included information on
the environmental impacts from our agricultural
solutions contract manufacturers for active
ingredients this year because they are material to our
business and we believe that it is our responsibility
to work with our closest business partners to help
reduce their impacts all measurement techniques
are indicated with the data
