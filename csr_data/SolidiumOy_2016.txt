 investments was eur 70 billion on 30 june 2016 eur 84 billion        and require professional participation from their members

decrease in the market value of the companies we own during the          board in each company is also an important influencing channel

half of the new members elected to the boards of our portfolio
companies were women at the same time it should be kept in
mind that diversity in the boards encompasses much more than
just gender and nationality and the diversity of the boards of our
portfolio companies has been broadened by increasing digital
competence among other things

responsible operations strengthen
shareholder value
responsibility is one of the key requirements of successful
business operations and longterm value creation as well as a
material aspect of a companys management culture responsible
and active shareholding is part of our work solidiums mandate
as an owner and investor is our most important and farreaching
channel for contributing to responsibility
   the variety of corporate responsibility themes is growing fast
and we should continuously put our competence to the test an
example of the development steps we took in the past financial
year is the renewed analysis tool put into use it provides us with
a better themebased method to view the corporate responsibility
matters of our holdings either as risks or opportunities we also
organised human rights training taken by the entire personnel and
began assessing the carbon footprint of our portfolio companies
   in matters related to taxation we require our portfolio
companies to be as transparent as possible

work for finnish ownership continues
when solidium was founded in 2008 its initial holdings totalled
approximately eur 5 billion over the course of these years we
have succeeded in contributing to the development of our portfolio
companies and in growing shareholder value using the means and
resources available for an owner including the profit distribution
of autumn 2016 during the eight years we have disbursed to the
state eur 47 billion despite of this the value of all our holdings
as of 31 august 2016 totals eur 74 billion
    solidium continues to be a strong finnish owner who works
to secure the growth of its portfolio companies and to increase
shareholder value over the long term this is the mission for which
the state owner founded us and we continue to fulfil this mission
in the future as well after the end of our financial year the extra
general meeting of solidium elected a new board of directors
of solidium as of 1 august 2016 with the new board of directos
solidium has a good basis to continue the work within the authority
and scope of duties as decided by its owner
    i would like to extend my thanks to solidiums personnel for the
work well done in the past financial year despite the challenging
situation in our portfolio companies markets and in our operating
environment we succeeded in our core task our work for finnish
ownership continues to be important and we can approach the
future with confidence

observations on the new analysis method                                  ngos towards solidium was not high in the financial year similar
the investment teams have found the new responsibility analysis          to the previous period
beneficial since it provides an opportunity to focus on themes             solidiums board of directors discussed corporate responsibility
which are material for each company the method also offers a            matters twice during the financial year through the portfolio
systematic comparison between aspects selected by the company           companies materiality analyses at the beginning of the financial
on one hand and those emphasised by the owner on the other            year and the annual review of the responsible ownership at the
    in future internal dialogue within solidium will be important in    end of the period

this would place additional requirements on the information              personnel are wellversed in corporate responsibility and update

would develop their responsibility reporting also from this basis           human rights awareness was strengthened among personnel
                                                                         through a lecture series on human rights the lectures were

numeric comparability of the information during the financial year     corporate responsibility the programme provides a framework
we examined data that corporate responsibility rating experts          for our responsibility work it supports solidiums mission to grow
could provide                                                           the financial value of its holdings over the long term and also
   we also developed a more extensive method for assessing               strengthens solidiums operating model of responsible ownership
the carbon footprint of solidiums portfolio we also studied the        sustainability themes currently emphasised by the other finnish

of the revenue and for an even higher proportion of the operating        now even more significant net producer of pulp any decisions to
profit stora enso is more profitable than it has been in a long         increase pulp capacity will potentially be overshadowed by the

products from wood fibre however this is a slow process and            good operative development not yet

tions in volumes and market values and may therefore significantly

deficient management and monitoring or from slow reaction to
changes taking place in the market situation and the operating
environment

shares owned by the company as a result of changes in market
prices interest rates exchange rates share prices credit risk
margins or changes in price fluctuations the company does not
hedge its equity investments with derivatives or other instruments
