features the teak tectona grandis mini
forest which covers a 10 acre area located
behind the perlis plant


as part of cimas contribution to preserve
the   environment    and    ecosystem     the
company embarked on a reforestation and
greening programme in 1997 besides our
efforts to create an environmentally friendly
atmosphere more importantly the trees act
as natural pollution control barriers against
dust and noise which are generated from the
cement manufacturing plants and adjacent
quarry operations


since then we initiated a few more tree
planting projects whereby we planted 5000
sentang azadirachta excelsea saplings
and 3000 merawan siput hopea odorata
saplings these tree saplings were planted
along the road shoulders of the main
chupingmata ayer road which is within
cimas property boundary various trees were
also planted along the fences of the cement
plant and quarry in addition to aesthetic
reasons the trees also serve to entrap dust
particles generated from the plant area

1   what does sustainability mean to cima

     cima aims to make a positive and sustainable contribution
     to the economic social and environmental performance of
     malaysia and its people

     at cima we have made continuous efforts to maintain a high
     degree of sustainability in our cement operations in line with the
     10th malaysia plan to promote sustainable and environmentally
     friendly cement and cement related products which feature                                        3
     world class innovation and technology



2   how do sustainability issues impact cimas business and financial performance

     the sustainability characteristics of a cement manufacturer should be assessed throughout its
     lifecycle from quarrying packaging distributing to waste management

     sustainability in building materials should be addressed with the understanding that cement
     quarrying and aggregates are crucial in the construction and infrastructure development
     industry in addition to addressing environmental and natural resource needs the development
     of ecofriendly building materials which feature low energy consumption and less waste
     should replace traditional bricks in the construction of green buildings



3   who are cimas main stakeholders and how do you communicate with them on
     sustainability issues that are important to them

     our stakeholders include suppliers customers the media employees industry peers trade
     unions the government regulatory authorities and the local community

     during the period under review we communicated with our stakeholders either directly or
     indirectly the topics of compliance environmentallyfriendly building materials employees
     health and safety and involvement with the local community were the main concerns of all our
     stakeholders

             cement industries of malaysia berhad




    4   what are the main risks and opportunities you have identified by engaging with your
         stakeholders on sustainability related issues

         as the economy grows and gets wealthier the demand for construction materials such
         as cement and concrete is booming this is particularly visible in emerging economies in
         malaysia demand for building materials was subdued recently due to lower construction
         spending however demand is expected to recover going forward as the largescale
         economic transformation programme etp and other land redevelopment projects are being
         progressively rolled out

4        the global cement industry is facing the challenge to sustain its business while decreasing its
         carbon intensity from production processes fuel use and its product end use this is an issue
         which has spurred widespread effort to reduce the carbon footprint of cement production


         risk factors subject to special attention include

               the thermal efficiency of kilns
                  it is important to ensure that all our future plants are built according to the best
                     available technology the equipment in numerous plants worldwide is still very far
                     from the best to achieve optimal efficiency

               the use of cement
                  concrete consumption can be reduced sometimes by more than 50 by applying
                     the right design and switching to higher quality or special concretes this requires an
                     enhanced cooperation with the customer as well as improved education information
                     and training on the most advanced alternatives available from cement suppliers

               the use of additives and substitutes to cement clinker
                  the use of ordinary portland cement is the established business practice in the
                     building sectors of most industrialised and developing countries conventional and
                     advanced alternatives to portland cement can lead to substantial co2 reductions
                     ranging from 20 to 80 depending on the case

                                                                           sustainability report 2011




5   what are you doing to ensure that your business practices meet sustainability criteria
     identified from your stakeholders

     sustainability requires good corporate governance transparency and a sense of responsibility
     to the relevant stakeholders in order to sustain our edge as a leader in the cement market we
     realise we need to meet the increasingly demanding needs and expectations of our customers
     excellence in products and service timely deliverables and feedback are paramount in
     maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction

     we aim to reduce and mitigate any potentially adverse effects on the environment and seek to
     conduct our activities in an environmentally responsible manner we have developed a range         5
     of management practices aimed at promoting sustainable development and we are committed
     to the integration of environmental considerations into decision making at all levels of our
     organisation



6   has your approach to sustainability changed in recent years

     the main challenge is how to transform the traditional way of producing cement into a
     sustainable business model and how efforts to reduce the emissions from the cement sector
     can be implemented in a timely fashion

     we regard sustainability as a management task and part of our corporate strategy we are
     committed to efficiency sustainable profitability a clear focus on customers and profitable
     growth at cima we have made ongoing concerted efforts to reduce the carbon intensity
     of our operations and at the same time to promote social and economic development in the
     communities in which we operate

             cement industries of malaysia berhad




    7   what are the sustainability issues in the cement industry and how is cima responding


               environmental management system
                     we comply with all legal requirements imposed on our operations and in particular
                     we operate our cement plants in bukit ketri perlis and bahau negeri sembilan
                     in accordance with the requirements of the iso 140012004 our bahau plant is
                     certified compliant to iso 140012004 while the perlis plant is working towards
                     certification

6              air emissions
                     we are committed to implementing companywide carbon emission measuring
                     and verification practices this is very essential in order to make our plants more
                     sustainable and to establish a baseline for future reduction goals

               noise pollution
                    we mitigate the noise associated with our operations through operational controls
                    and measures such as noise suppression isolation of noise sources and careful
                    scheduling of blasting activities

               biodiversity conservation
                     as part of cimas contribution to reforestation and greening efforts we had embarked
                     on a reforestation and greening programme since 1997

               quality assurance
                     cima continually assesses analyses and improves its quality management system



    8   which sustainability initiatives are you most proud of

         being certified compliant to iso 14001 is one such initiative the other is our investment in
         innovative ecoefficient technologies such as the use of alternative fuels and raw materials
         in cement manufacturing our products ns ecocrete and the masonry unit ns bricks and
         ns interlocking bricks are certified by sirim malaysia which are tested and verified against
         strict eco products criteria ns ecocrete also received the green label certification by the
         singapore environment council sec

                                                                            sustainability report 2011




9    over the next 12 to 24 months how do you think cimas approach to sustainability will
      evolve

      we will be coming up with a sustainability framework which we will be incorporating into our
      business practice by doing more for the local community and the environment our employees
      will achieve a better sense of pride we will also strive to provide a better work environment
      for our employees we endeavour to be more responsible in our product development and
      operations



10   what does the future hold for cimas business and how will sustainability issues feature
                                                                                                         7
      we will continue to feature our environmentallyfriendly ecolabelgreen label cement and
      ecobricks in our business practice and train our employees to be more environmentally
      aware we would like our employees to participate more in corporate sustainability cs
      activities we will therefore be introducing various activities and programmes so we are able
      to take that first step in participating in cs activities together such as reducing our carbon
      footprint and managing our co2 emissions we will also ensure our sites coexist with their
      neighbours in a constructive manner and ideally we would also want to set a target to better
      manage our greenhouse gas emissions

      basically we will be working towards building a more sustainable entity

     flouride sludge is classified as scheduled waste under eqa 1974 coded as sw207 which is basically generated from the
     wastewater treatment plant for fuel alternatively paddy husk is use as a substitute for coal and diesel this approach
     preserves natural resources and helps keep waste out of landfills and incinerators while at the same time helps to create
     an essential building material for the future

     the use of alternative raw materials also provides substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the cement
     manufacturing process these benefits are important considerations when evaluating the true environmental cost of our

energy and co2 efficiency

cement manufacturing is a complex and energyintensive process a key stage in this
process is the conversion of ground raw materials calcium carbonate clay andor shale
into clinker synthetic cementitious minerals in the kiln this process involves the heating
calcination and sintering of blended and ground materials to form clinker which involves
highenergy usage

greenhouse gases are generated chiefly in the production of clinker which is the main
ingredient in cement clinker is produced in large rotary kilns by processing limestone clay
and other minerals under very high temperatures 1400 c or 2500 f carbon dioxide
co2 results from the fuel combustion required to achieve such high temperatures and from                 43
the chemical decomposition of limestone into lime and co2

energy savings during cement production could lead to lower environmental impact at
cima we strive to improve energy efficiency and to reduce co2 emissions by optimising the
cement manufacturing process and reducing the number of kiln stoppages off peak hour
operations also help to save energy due to favourable conditions such as lower ambient
temperature we have installed energy efficient tools and equipment to reduce electric
power consumption

dust

dust is a major industrial pollutant of the environment at cement production plants the major source of dust emission is
the production process

cima has implemented a programme of periodic measurements for fugitive dust in order to safeguard the health of its
employees as well as to reduce the impact on areas nearby further care is taken to ensure the proper maintenance and
optimal functioning of machinery and equipment as well as the rigorous application of rules covering the transport of

     nitrogen oxides nox

     nitrogen oxides nox are formed during the clinker production process because of the associated high temperature of
     2000 c we are continually optimising the operation of our kilns in order to reduce nox emissions


     sulphur oxides so2

     sulphur oxides so2 can also form as a result of the clinker burning process the base substance here is the sulphur
     contained in the raw material most of which gets incorporated in the clinker sulphide sulphur compounds in the raw
     material can lead to increased so2 emission levels

noise pollution

quarrying involves several activities which generate significant amounts of noise it starts with
preparatory activities such as establishing road or rail access compound and mineral processing
facilities next is the process of exposing the mineral to be extracted and this is usually done by
removing the top soil and other soft layers using a scraper or hydraulic excavators and dump trucks
the excavation of the mineral itself will involve considerable noise particularly if blasting methods
are used following this the use of powered machinery to transport the materials as well as possibly
processing plants to crush and grade the minerals all contribute to even more noise

we mitigate the noise associated with our operations through operational controls and measures such
as noise suppression isolation of noise sources and careful scheduling of blasting activities
                                                                                                           47

                                                        reminded to always keep the door closed

                                                       a programme is in place whereby the older
                                                        equipment is being replaced with newer
                                                        versions in stages which have inbuilt
                                                        silencers that significantly attenuate the level
                                                        of noise generated

     waste management

     at cima we seek to minimise waste generation from our business activities through our onsite reduce reuse and
     recycle initiatives any inprocess materials eg limestone dust clinker unfinished cement are recycled back into the
     manufacturing chain to ultimately produce finished cement products

     the primary sources of waste arise from the necessary maintenance and repair of equipment onsite eg spent lubricants
     consumables etc where source segregation is used to maximise the percentage of recycled and reused waste materials
     and minimise disposal to landfills

     our processes generate waste which is disposed according to our established procedures in compliance with legal
     requirements

         biodiversity conservation

         cimas operations can potentially affect habitats and species especially through land clearance for quarrying and
         emissions to air and water the opening operation and closing of our cement and aggregates sites in particular
         can potentially affect biodiversity and ecosystem health through habitat degradation species disturbance
         changes in groundwater levels discharges to water bodies and dust emissions

         therefore we are committed to being a responsible steward of the land we manage and to conduct our
         operations in a sustainable manner thereby protecting the biodiversity within our operations and maximising our

         ordinary portland cement opc
        exceeds the performance standard set out for a low heat cement
        longer pumping distances results in less energy requirement


     in addition ns ecocrete was subjected to a set
     of comprehensive and rigorous inprocess and
     final inspection test to ensure that it exceeded
     the performance standards set out for a low
     heat cement it is suitable for mass concreting
     application where a low heat hydration is

ns bricks

   helps to conserve water resources as the
    manufacturing process of ns bricks utilises pond
    water harvested from rain

   utilises quarry dust and low quality limestone which
    cannot be used for cement and otherwise will have to
    be disposed of

   eliminates the need to burn wood to make clay bricks

   ns interlocking bricks provide a sustainable building     69
    solution for the construction of low rise buildings and

             of materials capital or services it provides an alternative to conventional methods used for obtaining price
             bids via sealed commercial bids instead of going through a lengthy facetoface negotiation bidders are
