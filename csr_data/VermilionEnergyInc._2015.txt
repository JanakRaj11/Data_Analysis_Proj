and adhere to our long term strategy of balanced and diversified growth g 4  1 3

    new lightoil focused core area in canada for organic growth and land expansion subsequent to the transaction
    we expanded our land base by leasing an additional 15000 net acres of undeveloped land

message from our chief executive officer

it is my pleasure to welcome you to
vermilions second annual sustainability
report although producing an annual
sustainability report is still a relatively
new venture for vermilion producing oil
and gas in a sustainable and socially
responsible manner is not

vermilions core values of excellence trust respect
and responsibility have guided what we do and how
we do it throughout our 20year history we have
always remained committed to conducting our
activities in a manner that protects the health and
safety of our people and those in the community and
have continuously striven to operate our business in
the most environmentally protective manner possible
these objectives have consistently been given our
highest priority and will continue to take precedence
in the future


producing the energy that many people and
businesses rely upon to meet their daily needs and
sustain their quality of life is both a great privilege and
a great responsibility we are acutely aware that we all
have a role to play in addressing the environmental
impacts of a carbon economy whether as producers or
consumers of fossil fuel energy that is why vermilion
remains committed to protecting the environment                                lorenzo donadeo ceo
through improvements that maximize energy and water
efficiency as well as reductions in our greenhouse gas
emissions while also applying careful consideration for
the lands impacted by our operations


looking back on 2014 i am proud of what we accomplished and encouraged that these accomplishments were
achieved despite the challenging industry environment caused by the significant downturn in commodity prices
during the latter half of the year i believe our success is due in part to our continued focus on ensuring that hse
takes precedence over all other factors of our business our people subscribe to the belief that successful well
managed companies manage their sustainability impacts above all else we believe that by embedding sustainability
into our business strategy we are not only mitigating costly worker safety public safety environmental financial and
reputational risks but that we will ultimately generate economic and social benefits for all our stakeholders and for
those in the communities in which we operate

   values matter  vermilion 2014 sustainability report                                            our approach to sustainability




  these expectations align economic success with every element of our sustainability
  commitments and have led us to prioritize our objectives in the following order




                       the safety and health of our staff and those involved directly or indirectly in

      1                our operations nothing is more important




                       our responsibility to protect the environment we follow the precautionary

      2                principle g 4  1 4 introduced in 1992 by the united nations rio declaration on
                       environment and development g 4  1 5 by using environmental risk as part of
                       our development decision criteria and by continually seeking improved
                       environmental performance in our operations




                       economic success through a focus on operational excellence across our

      3                business which includes technical and process excellence efficiency
                       expertise and stakeholder relations




we believe these three priorities generally do not conflict with each other because business that is conducted in the safest
and cleanest manner is also most likely to be the most profitable way to do business over the long term in instances
where these three priorities may be in conflict we instruct our staff that the health and safety of people and the protection
of the environment must always take priority over profit


our board of directors and our executive and leadership teams continue to recognize our stakeholders expectations as
critical to vermilions success and integrate them into our ongoing processes for governance strategy and performance
they are incorporated as goals into our strategic longterm vision identified as commitments for annual planning and
assessed on a quarterly basis for progress against those commitments


we believe this approach continues to be a contributing reason why vermilion is a leading choice for investors employees
partners and communities

commitments

in 2014 we continued to make good progress toward achieving our immediate and
longerterm sustainability goals dealing primarily with vermilions direct internal
sustainability impacts

these constitute the most important sustainability opportunities and risks arising from sustainability trends prioritized
as we describe in the about our report section of this report in terms of impact on vermilions organizational success
and relevance to our key stakeholders


at the same time outside trends have potential impacts on short and longerterm company performance


these include by priority the risk associated with


    an adverse hse event

    the volatility of oil and gas prices

    potential changes to government regulations and fiscal policies in our operating areas

    the longterm financial implications of climate change and

    public concerns about our industry


vermilions board of directors executive team and risk management committee regularly review these risks along with
mitigation strategies and associated opportunities

about our report

our 2014 sustainability report is vermilions second annual report on our economic
environmental social and governance eesg impacts the content of which emphasizes
our activities throughout the 2014 calendar year our intent is to produce an updated
downloadable full report on an annual basis however in the spirit of environmental
stewardship we are electing not to produce print versions of these reports annually



we continue to use the grig4 framework to guide our sustainability reporting as we believe the global reporting
initiative remains the current leading framework for eesg reporting the information we have shared to date is largely
reflective of our decision to report in accordance with gris comprehensive reporting option our 2014 report follows
the same fourstep process of identification prioritization validation and review as we followed for our 2013 report
and incorporates the key principles of sustainability context materiality completeness and stakeholder inclusiveness

stakeholder engagement


our people partners suppliers investors and
members of the communities in which we
operate continue to be regarded as vermilions
key stakeholders those whom we believe to
have the greatest impact on our business or
whom are most impacted by our activities

we continue to base stakeholder identification and prioritization
on our understanding and analysis of our value chain g 4  2 5 the
degree to which we engage with our stakeholders continues to
be dependent upon the area of impact or influence of the
stakeholder group


we believe that a failure in our economic environmental andor
social performance could have negative and longlasting effects
on our key stakeholders


in turn these groups influence our business and operations in several ways including through the provision of capital to
fund our activities as well as the setting of expectations regarding safety and environmental performance meeting these
expectations is the key to maintaining our social license to operate and to increasing our productivity and we therefore
engage with these stakeholders on a regular and ongoing basis


for those stakeholders with lesser degrees of impact or influence our engagement is more specific and generally involves
direct engagement on specific issues


the following table details how we engage with our stakeholders topics raised and how we have responded g424 g426

identifying issues

to identify the topics relevant to vermilions 2014 sustainability report we began with
a review of the issues we had originally identified in our 2013 report g418 g419 g420 g421


    international standards including the united nations global compact oecd guidelines for multinational
    enterprises and the universal declaration of human rights

    reports from sectorrelated government and industry bodies including the canadian association of petroleum
    producers
    media scans

    sustainabilitycorporate responsibility reports from sectorleading companies

    published research and analysis from reporting entities such as gri the carbon disclosure project and the
    international integrated reporting council

    reports and benchmarking from third parties with insight into the area such as deloitte ernst  young kpmg
    iss sustainalytics accountability and bloomberg and socially responsible investor entities such as the dow jones
    sustainability index ftse4good and corporate knights capital


we then analyzed issues that vermilion identifies internally as important to the company using such sources as annual
reports risk matrices and internal policies and procedures by further examining our value chain including our
stakeholder engagement results we added issues that are important to the people and locations upon which our
operations have an impact


once we had reviewed the issues included in our 2013 report we then provided key internal stakeholders including
leadership team members with opportunities to provide their feedback on these original topics as well as any new
topics for consideration in the 2014 report g418 g419 g427


we also reflected upon the disclosure requirements and eesg topics contained within other sustainability reporting
frameworks as well as the sustainability reports and disclosure activities by our peers where we felt we could
strengthen our own reporting and disclosure we incorporated these topics into our 2014 report


finally we reviewed and reflected on the feedback that we have received from sri and other
sustainabilityrelated organizations since launching our inaugural report and incorporated this feedback where we felt
it strengthened our level of disclosure on the sustainability topics that matter most to vermilion and our key
stakeholders

material issues
the issues identified for this report have been crossreferenced to the gri g4 aspects and standard disclosures list a boundary
assessment for each aspect was performed in our 2013 reporting cycle and it was determined that the outcomes of the original
assessment for each aspect had not changed as to its relevance to vermilion or any of the stakeholders throughout our value chain g 4  2 0
g421



where the issues were relevant to vermilion or its stakeholders we reevaluated whether they were of high medium or low impact on
vermilion and high medium or low impact from the perspective of our key stakeholder groups


we wish to continue to emphasize that materiality in the context of this report is not a judgment on societal importance for example the
issues surrounding the use of child labour are of significant concern however their impact on vermilion and our stakeholders is
considered low as a result of our operations being located in countries with robust laws and enforcement around these issues while
unlikely were vermilion were to extend its operations into a geographical region where child labour was at higher risk to occur within our
supply chain we would assess this as having a higher potential impact


moreover while we remain comfortable with our original highmedium assessment for the regulatory framework topic we continually
monitor changes that could influence its future categorization as it relates to the impact on vermilion for example in september 2014
the council of the european union formally adopted the directive on disclosure of nonfinancial and diversity information by certain large
companies this directive introduced measures that will strengthen the transparency and accountability of approximately 6000
companies in the eu who have more than 500 employees while the changes may not affect vermilion from a mandatory perspective
because our staff count in our fbu does not meet the directives threshold the changes nevertheless affect our environment and the
sustainability context within which we operate


the following parameters were used to assess the level of impact on vermilion

we used a similar approach to assessing potential impact of these issues on stakeholders we analyzed our engagement results with
different groups of stakeholders to identify issues and rate their importance reflecting the criticalhigh importantmedium and small
low definitions from the table above we also took into consideration how directly affected the stakeholders were for example
employees and fenceline communities are more directly affected by vermilions operations than are governments we then integrated
those results to identify where issues had a common impact or concern spanning several key stakeholder groups g418 g419


the resulting summary of all gri aspects is contained in our full gri materiality analysis which you can find in our additional
information g419 g420 g421

 values matter  vermilion 2014 sustainability report                                                proven performance




we continue to monitor corporate governance regulations and legal requirements while also maintaining a watch on
trends in governance disclosure and structure along with benchmarks that compare our performance to that of our
peers we use this information to implement practices and policies that ensure vermilion remains best in class in the
area of governance in 2014 for example we introduced an annual say on pay advisory vote which received 99
support from shareholders we also adopted antihedging and clawback policies and updated our ownership policy
g453



the say on pay advisory vote reflects our belief that shareholders should have the opportunity to understand the
objectives philosophy and principles the board has used in its approach to executive compensation decisions and have
an opportunity to have a nonbinding advisory vote on vermilions approach a second annual say on pay advisory
vote was held at our 2015 annual general meeting on may 8 2015 and received 99 support from shareholders g 4  5 3



vermilion has been following an antihedging policy on an informal basis for some time but formally adopted the
policy in february 2014 the antihedging policy prohibits directors and officers from hedging vermilion shares and
ensures alignment through longterm holdings


the clawback policy was also adopted in february 2014 and demonstrates that our board will act on behalf of
shareholders to hold management accountable for their actions the clawback policy requires repayment where the
executives and officers engaged in intentional misconduct that causes financial restatement g 4  5 1


in february 2014 we also increased the share ownership requirement for executives to demonstrate our commitment to
aligning executives to shareholder interests as owners of vermilion the chief executive officer ceo share
ownership requirement increased from three 3 times annual base salary to five 5 times and share ownership for the
president and chief operating officer and executive vice presidents increased from two 2 times annual base salary to
three 3 times

fair culture

fair culture is about understanding human involvement in relation to events and
establishing a fair transparent assessment of the behaviour

we developed and implemented a canadian fair culture policy in september 2014 the current policy applies to all
canadianbased vermilion staff and third parties performing work on our canadian premises similar countryspecific
policies for france the netherlands and germany are being developed and will be implemented throughout 2015 we
have had a fair culture policy  referred to locally as the culpability procedure  in place in australia since 2011 g 4  5 6



we developed the policy because we believe that fair culture


    encourages organizations to learn from their mistakes
    identifies the underlying causes of events involving human error
    fairly assigns responsibility and consequences to individuals and leaders following an event
    rewards behaviours that meet or exceed expectations and closely examines and addresses noncompliance
    identifies appropriate organizational resolutions to address the underlying causes of events




the purpose of our fair culture policy is to establish fair and consistent procedures by which all reported events or
potential violations of company policies and guidelines or local laws are properly reviewed documented and resolved
the policy creates transparency by outlining procedures for reporting and investigating events and complaints



we believe this new policy creates a balanced approach to assessing organizational leader and employee accountability
as it relates to an event helping to align vermilion with industry best practices and positioning us as a leader in the fair
culture approach

board diversity

we recognize the importance of diversity as a component of board effectiveness and
business performance diversity and complementarity of skills are key criteria in
vermilions board nomination process g438 g440

our current board is made up of a diverse group of individuals with a broad range of skill sets we believe that by
composing our board with individuals that bring diverse backgrounds and skills vermilion has been and will continue to
be successful in problemsolving deliberating key issues and making quality decisions that deliver positive longterm
results for our shareholders and stakeholders alike we also recognize the importance of gender diversity and at this
time our board has two female members which represents 20 of the board to learn more about vermilions board of
directors please see our 2015 proxy statement and information circular


skills matrix



we maintain a skills matrix to evaluate the skill set of the board each director rates their level of expertise in each area
annually on a scale from limited to expert application the results are then evaluated for individuals and for the board as a
whole following our most recent assessment it was determined that there was a minimum of five and up to nine directors
that were skilled at the expertmastery levels in each of 12 of the 13 areas assessed


as part of our most recent recruiting process for additional board members the directors skills matrix was reviewed by
the board to ensure an appropriate mix of backgrounds skills and experience to guide vermilions longterm strategy and
ongoing business operations the review process resulted in changes to the 2014 skills matrix including the addition of
risk management and reserve evaluation skills

board election  tenure



board members are elected and reelected on an
annual basis individually as opposed to elected by
slate we do not have a term limit for directors we
believe that a directors depth of knowledge specific to
our company is a valuable asset to shareholders and we
believe it is important to have directors who understand
our industry and our companys specific characteristics
while term limits can help ensure the board gains new
perspectives imposing this restriction means it would
lose the contributions of longer serving directors who
have developed a deeper knowledge and understanding
of vermilion and our industry over time we also value
new perspectives in the last two years we have
appointed three new directors to the board who bring
valuable new skills and experience to our company

in 2014 we opened a new office in amsterdam by being conveniently located
close to public transportation it has reduced the commute times of a number
of our staff which in turn has led to improvements in worklife balance the
colocation of our european management team has led to efficiencies while
also enhancing our ability to recruit top talent in addition to the new office in
amsterdam we also established an office in schönefeld germany and an
office in denver colorado we chose these locations because of their proximity
to transportation links which helps us reduce our carbon footprint and we
also chose these locations for their attractiveness because we recognize the
importance of location on our ability to attract and recruit top talent


by nurturing and protecting our culture we believe we attract and retain the

low voluntary turnover rate which has remained well below the industry

spotlight wandoo extended living quarters

the nature and location of vermilions operations are such that staff living quarters or
camps are not required for our business  the vast majority of our people get to return
to the comfort of their own homes and communities after a days work



the exception to this is our offshore operations in australia where staff on the platform work 2 weeks on and 2 weeks
off


with staff comfort and safety in mind we extended the living quarters on our wandoo platform in 2014 doubling the
capacity and allowing single room occupancy during normal operations the accommodation upgrade also allowed for
improvements of our wandoo gym facilities and expansion of the dining room


using nine prefabricated modules the additional living space was designed manufactured installed and integrated into
the existing permanent living quarters following the removal of the temporary alternate living quarters this was no
small undertaking given that our wandoo platform is located approximately 80 km off the northwest shelf of australia


the whole project from placement of order for the modules to occupancy took 12 months and was successfully
managed inhouse thanks to great team effort by various groups the extended living quarters are fire proof blast
proof and to a large degree noise proof  offering our wandoo staff a safe and more comfortable living arrangement
while working at sea

a great place to work

as a high performing organization we are
focused on building a team of highly motivated
empowered people who work together to deliver
superior results for stakeholders and make
vermilion a great place to work

for a sixth year in a row we have made the great place to work institutes best workplaces list in both canada and
france we also made the best workplaces list in the netherlands for a second year in a row


    in canada we placed 10th out of more than 300 participating companies

    in france we placed 9th out of the 101 participating companies marking continued improvement against our 13th
    place ranking in 2014 and 27th place ranking in 2013 and

    in the netherlands we placed 8th out of the 79 participating companies an improvement over our 10th place
    ranking in 2014 our inaugural year of participation


the rankings are based on the institutes twofold approach which includes an independent assessment of our culture
along with our employees confidential responses to the institutes survey


our rankings  and staff participation rates  have remained strong year over year since we
began our involvement with the great place to work institute


in part we attribute our strong results to the importance we place on reviewing and addressing the staff feedback shared
through each business units annual survey we believe the feedback gleaned from these surveys is so important that we
ask staff in all business units to participate in the survey regardless of whether or not the business units staff count
meets the minimum requirement to compete for best workplace recognition this was the case in australia where we
were one staff member short of meeting the 2015 requirement


through the survey results we gain a strong understanding of why our people choose to come to vermilion what they
value and why they choose to stay competitive total compensation exciting opportunities for growth and development
and pride in how we give back to the communities where our people live and work continue to be reasons why our
voluntary turnover rate is among the lowest in our industry

strong communication  use of technology to
enhance information sharing

at vermilion we employ a number of communication channels to ensure everyone
understands vermilions corporate goals and the key role they play in helping to achieve
them

being the best requires strong communication and sharing which is why we have a culture of respectful open twoway
communication at vermilion leaders make themselves available to staff and staff feel comfortable approaching
leaders through the annual great place to work survey  an excellent feedback tool in and of itself  our people often
tell us that they value the approachability of our leaders at vermilion and that they feel heard


we understand that nothing beats face time so members of our senior leadership team make visits to our field and
international business unit locations


we continue to organize at least two staff updates per year where members of the executive present our progress and
plans these meetings are usually videotaped or webcasted for the benefit of staff who are not located at our corporate
headquarters a staff interactive component is often included so that staff can help generate ideas and provide
feedback these staff interactive sessions are an excellent way for questions concerns and suggestions to be raised
with the knowledge that there will be postmeeting followup which often includes incorporation of the staff interactive
feedback into ongoing company strategy discussion


our bilingual corporate intranet launched in 2013 has proven to be a great success content generation and
publishing is a shared responsibility amongst stakeholders from across the organization and we take a very
managed approach to ensuring the editorial content remains fresh and informative we believe this is a large reason
why traffic to the employee portal continues to remain high for example our unique visitors to the intranet in
q1 2015 increased by 14 compared to q1 2014 we leverage functionality in sharepoint to help our staff
connect and collaborate across the globe throughout 2014 and into 2015 there continues to be strong uptake of
team site and forms functionality by operations hse engineering and corporate teams in their daytoday work
activities

at vermilion we mean it when we say we dont want anyone to get hurt  we want to make
sure everyone returns home safe every day


that is why in 2014 we took over nine months to compile a comprehensive data set from across business units and
worked with our international operations to identify the top 5 fatal risks on the job and how they could be eliminated
andor mitigated


there were definitely more than five risks identified so we selected those risks that were common across our
operations for a more detailed review we then assessed those hazards and developed comprehensive plans specific to
each business unit to prevent those hazards from occurring finally the groups focused on what could be done to
eliminate the hazard or what barriers and controls were required to help prevent an event from happening


at each fatal risk session we built on our peoples experience demonstrating the effective collaboration of our
operations and management groups a solid plan supporting risk prevention is being put in place that aligns with all the
efforts weve directed towards competence and training programs in our operations new leading kpis which our staff
can access on our corporate intranet have been created to follow vermilions progress on hazard awareness and risk
prevention as part of our corporate scorecard


the top 5 fatal risks identified at vermilion are


    1  driving

    2  energy isolation electricalmechanical etc

    3  crushed  caught between struck by

    4  process hydrocarbon release

    5  fall from heights

thanks to an ingenious solution developed by staff in australia anodes on our wandoo
platforms calm buoy were replaced in 2014 using a new approach that eliminated many
safety risks and reduced costs



during the april 2014 diving campaign in our
australia business unit the anodes on the
underside of the calm buoy were noted as near
depletion and in need of changeout in the past
replacing these anodes required divers with
program costs in excess of 1 million



with a diameter of 16 metres the floating steel
calm catenary anchored leg mooring buoy is
an essential part of how oil is transferred from
the wandoo platform to the tanker that will carry
it to market the buoy is held in position by six
large chains connected to anchors in 53 metres
of water two subsea pipelines carry the oil from
the platform to the buoy where the tanker is
moored the buoys 16inch diameter floating
hose is then used to transfer oil to the tanker

cathodic protection is essential to
wandoos operation without cathodic
protection the salt water of the ocean
would quickly begin to corrode the buoys
steel structure weakening it and greatly
shortening its life when aluminum blocks
anodes are placed against the buoys

softer aluminum instead of the steel thus
preserving the buoy ensuring its integrity
and lengthening its life



with the help of field personnel we came up with an anode design and installation that eliminated the need for a diving
campagn it cost just 3500 to procure the project materials and we eliminated the need for external support and
expenditures by utilizing existing operations personnel and equipment for the installation



the first principle in risk reduction is to
eliminate the hazard  so we asked how can
we do this without divers the solution was
to install the anodes above water using a
bolted connection this approach avoids the
need for welding or grinding it thereby
reduces the highest of the workrelated risks
and mitigates the potential for damage or
entanglement as the calm buoy freely
rotates 360 degrees similar to a weather
vane


the selected design involves installing six 8
metrelong 25mmdiameter anode strings
these are bolted to the fender brackets of
the calm buoy above the water and hang
into the water like the tentacles of a jellyfish
to install the strings operational personnel
accessed the calm buoy from wandoo b on
a calm sea day using a small work response
craft


we met our objectives and the result is a simple lowrisk lowcost repeatable solution

hse perception survey

we know that the best management systems and processes in the world will fail without
strong leadership from the top and widespread buyin throughout the organization

vermilions management team is expected to demonstrate leadership and commitment and promote hse performance
through active and visible participation our management sets the tone and provides the vision and resources required
to achieve our hse objectives

we know that all of our employees and contractors play a critical role in the success of our hse performance and in
helping to establish and maintain a safetyoriented workplace overall that is why in 2013 we asked all staff globally to
share with us their perceptions regarding 10 overarching safety climate factors via our first ever hse perception survey



the 10 safety climate factors include


    management commitment

    safety procedures

    team functioning

    competency

    morale

    organizational commitment

    supervisor commitment

    incident outcomes

    personal responsibility for safety

    fair culture


thanks to the over 90 staff response rate we have a solid baseline measure of staff perceptions of how well they feel
that safety is being managed at vermilion two years out we continue to mine the data and work to better understand
the inaugural survey results and use those learnings to identify focus areas

for example our fair culture policy which was implemented in canada in 2014 and will be implemented throughout
our other business units in 2015 was developed in response to staff feedback via the survey indicating that vermilions
incident investigation and resolution process was not sufficiently clear other examples of actions taken in 2014 as a
result of the hse perceptions survey feedback include advancement of our competency programs updates to our event
management practice emp and enhancement of our event management information system emis


our second hse perceptions survey is planned for 2016 with subsequent surveys planned to occur every three to four
years thereafter we believe this schedule will provide the timeframe required to clearly understand the outcomes and
effectively plan and implement the actions required to respond to or address the survey findings

our focus on safety

our focus on fostering a safetyoriented culture is reflected in our hse mantra of hse
everywhere everyday everyone this focus starts from the top and is entrenched
throughout our organization


at vermilion we strive to engrain safety
awareness throughout all facets of the
organization not just in our field operations
we believe our hse mantra emphasizes that
keeping people safe isnt just up to the hse or
operations departments but involves every
individual whether they work as a technician in
the field an accountant in the office or
volunteering in the community during a day of
caring



quarterly hse leadership meetings held at the
corporate level and whose participants include
senior management and hse advisors from all
divisions and subsidiaries represent 100 of            we might not necessarily think of a day of caring as a day of
                                                        safety but at vermilion that is exactly what it is these handson
our employees                                          opportunities arent just a way of giving back to the community they
                                                        are a way for our organization to demonstrate how hse truly matters
                                                        everywhere every day to everyone

in addition we hold mandatory hse meetings             in 2014 we had 111 people volunteering at one location and in 2015
                                                        this number grew to 122 volunteers we dont typically have this many
in every field district where participation of all      people working on a single project anywhere else in our organization
staff field and admin is required there is           even on the operations side of our business having a large group of
                                                        people in one place doing work that is outside of their daily routine
routine participation by senior management              increases the possible risks to a level higher than normal that is why
from calgary on a quarterly basis the monthly         a significant amount of prework goes into identifying hazards
                                                        mitigating andor eliminating these risks before the project starts
hse district meetings are replaced by district
town hall meetings that have an hse focus and           prior to the project being initiated our community investment staff
                                                        collaborate with our hse staff to conduct a site visit to identify and

2014 safety performance

as vermilions hse vision states we are committed to having a healthy workplace free of
incidents we monitor our health safety and environment management performance
through a series of leading indicators designed to monitor hazard identification and risk
mitigation measures applied in the workplace

these include contractor observations hazard identifications site inspections management and staff participation in
safety meetings and site visits lagging indicators such as number of recordable injuries number of spills and
associated volumes are used to evaluate the effectiveness of our hse program and are tracked as part of the feedback
loop in our proactive approach to create a safe and healthy workplace


in 2014 we met or exceeded over 92 of our leading indicators


total recordable injury frequency trif



total recordable frequency rate per 200000 work hours




our total recordable injury frequency rate for 2014 was 14635 per 200000 work hours which is an increase over our
2013 trif rate of 1093 and 2012 trif of 09718 in 2014 we had a total of 29 recordable injuries and all workers
involved were able to return to their duties in short order we remain focused on reducing the number of recordable
injuries down to zero therefore each incident was fully investigated and the appropriate corrective actions were
applied in an effort to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future

hse training

we have developed a comprehensive hse training matrix that looks at all of the technical
positions at vermilion globally  from field operators to senior professional staff  and
identifies the associated mandatory and recommended hse training requirements



we tracked nearly 16000 hours of training globally in 2014 and over a quarter of these hours represented hse training
delivered to our operations staff


because hse also applies to our office staff we have delivered training to this group on such topics as driving office
evacuation procedures aed automated external defibrillator training first aid and cpr cybersafety and personal
safety


operator competency



a significant focus of our 2014 hse training program was the advancement of operator competency programs ocp in
canada the netherlands and france  our australia operation already has a wellestablished ocp for its offshore
activities


in canada the focus of this work in 2014 and 2015 has been on the development of task procedures and levels of
assessment and we are targeting to formally roll out the ocp to field staff by end of 2015 in the netherlands ocp
assessment modules were implemented in 2013 so the focus in 2014 was to develop additional modules specifically for
its leadership team as well as for the operator function the maintenance function and the safety officer on site the
program is now well embedded in the nbu and new hires are enrolled during their onboarding session on their first day
with the company the focus moving forward will be to keep the system current and finetune assessment modules as
needed


in 2015 vermilion has planned to develop the ocp project scope and framing in france with the aim to roll out ocp to
field staff in the fbu in 20162017


operator competency helps in hazard identification and mitigates our exposure to a potential hse event by ensuring
that staff are properly trained to safely execute their daily tasks a clear view of employees competencies and training
increases vermilions confidence that job functions are being performed safely and consistently within the guidelines
of regulatory and vermilionspecific policies practices and guidelines


ultimately this work is intended to help us fulfill our hse vision of a healthy workplace free of incidents but will also
support more effective workforce planning and increase employee satisfaction and productivity

hse competency for leaders

vermilion is committed to ensuring all our staff and leaders understand the importance of hse and demonstrate this
in our actions we believe that all vermilions leaders whether operational or nonoperational  contribute to vermilions
success by helping to generate hse awareness identifying hse hazards and understanding and mitigating the hse
impact of requests made of staff and operations thats why our performance management system now includes a new
hse competency for leaders as follows


demonstrates hse leadership


    visibly acts in accordance with all hse policies standards procedures legislation and core values

    engages staff to identify and mitigate hazards and risks in order to fully integrate hse into vermilions
    day to day culture and

    facilitates the sharing of hse lessons learned


we provide resources to help our leaders understand what success looks like and how they can meet vermilions hse
expectations for example we believe that a leader who visibly acts in accordance with all hse policies standards
procedures legislation and core values is one who


    understands hse requirements makes them a priority and integrates them into daily activities

    walks the talk not hesitating to intervene for the safety of all staff who reports unsafe situations is
    willing to be challenged and follows up on commitments and

    believes in continuously learning and takes an active role in safety meetings investigations and reviews

public safety  emergency response

our commitment to public safety



we understand and accept the high expectations placed on us by our stakeholders to
ensure vermilion recognizes considers and mitigates potential safety impacts on the
residents in the communities in which we operate ensuring public safety has and will
continue to be our number one priority this is our license to operate

in the nbu for example our primary areas of focus regarding public safety include




earthquake risk assessments

we have never experienced seismicity related to our gas production over the last forty years of operation of our gas
fields in the netherlands nevertheless we are incorporating the latest independent scientific research and modeling
with respect to the probability of seismicity occurring in relation to our operations and the potential magnitude into
our development and production plans we are cooperating with all levels of government research institutes and local
communities to improve the industrys understanding and communication on this complex topic




subsidence risk assessments

as part of the production plan approval process we conduct extensive baseline subsidence measurement surveys and
construct detailed subsidence models to estimate the total lifetime subsidence as a result of gas production activities
once production has commenced we then conduct regular subsidence measurements to ensure gas extraction related
subsidence stays within our modeled expectations in the event that actual measured subsidence exceeds our
production plans we will cease production to conduct more detailed studies and measurement work to determine when
if ever production can be recommenced

early models and concepts werent as well developed as they are today while we endeavour to minimize any impact to
the communities we operate in if we have caused damages we will ensure they are compensated and corrected in
2014 vermilion contributed 36 million euros to a compensation fund related to the harlingen upper cretaceous field in
the province of friesland we voluntarily shut in this field in 2008 after we took over operatorship in 2004 due to
higher than expected levels of subsidence this field has remained shut in since that time with no plans for
reactivation

safety case revision


like all facilities operating in australian federal waters vermilions wandoo platform which is comprised of one manned
and one unmanned platform is required to resubmit its safety case every five years




we kicked off our safety consultation process in early may 2014 with a series of concept map workshops with staff
from projects well construction onshoreoffshore operations engineeringasset integrity and support functions we
asked these individuals to help us identify what could be done better and how we can embed the safety case into our
daytoday activities



in addition to these workshops we also conducted hazid hazard identification workshops which helped us to review
and update risk assessments previously conducted for all field activities we conducted comprehensive assessments for
accommodation fires amongst other major accident event scenarios identified for the wandoo field we submitted the
updated case to the regulator on october 9th 2014 and received full acceptance from nopsema in november 2014
four hse management systems documents were updated as a result of the review key learnings and takeaways from
this process included being cognizant of the time and effort it takes to conduct such a collaborative and holistic review
all personnel in the abu have become better educated regarding the risks associated with the wandoo field and the
ways we can collectively reduce these risks




life extension


the wandoo b platform calm buoy and flowlines were installed in 1996 based upon a 20year design life vermilion
has identified that there are recoverable oil reserves beyond the existing 20year design that could support extending
the design life by an additional 20 years the existing 20year design life will be reached in march 2017 in 2015
vermilion commenced the life extension project to extend the operation design life beyond 2017

life extension process


    vermilion undertakes extensive site surveys of the existing facilities to determine their current condition
    identify areas for maintenance and repair and verify their condition for ongoing use

    vermilion develops a basis of analysis that presents the criteria to be used to reassess the platform
    flowlines and calm buoy

    the latest meteorologic ocean data wave wind and current seismic loads are developed by subject
    matter experts

    the platform calm buoy and flowlines are then reassessed and the results compared to the latest
    codes and standards

    if the reassessment is supported by the independent verifying body ivb vermilion is issued with a
    verification certificate allowing us to operate the facility for the agreed future period


independent verifying body


    vermilion appoints an ivb that is a recognized expert to review the analysis and systems

    ivb issues a verification  validation statement verifying the platform is acceptable for ongoing use for a
    future period

    vermilion has selected lloyds register as the ivb that meets the requirements of the australian regulator
    nopsema

our focus on environment

we seek to operate our business in the most environmentally responsible manner
possible



the diversity and beauty of the
environments in which we operate
and live are daily reminders of the
value     of     protecting     the
environment




to do so we not only operate in
compliance with all environmental
regulations but strive to lead the
development of industry best

our board of directors maintains oversight in this area through its hse committee which has regular and direct
communications with our executive and leadership teams


we also assess and actively participate in policy development in several regulatory theaters across our operations in
france for example we are a member of the regional water basin committee in the ambès region  one of only six
water basin committees in the entire country in 2014 our ambès superintendent was elected to the committee for a
sixyear term the committee brings together both private and public stakeholders to discuss and define the main
priorities of the regions water policy and the protection of its natural aquatic environments the committee was
responsible for the creation of a master plan for water development and management sdage and is often referred to
as the water parliament of the basing 4  1 6

our commitment to pursuing bestinclass hse is also a commitment to pursuing
continuous improvement in all that we do in addition to continuing to build
processes to meaningfully track and understand our sustainability impacts we are
committed  wherever possible  to use processes that will reduce our
environmental impact

our focus on environmental stewardship places emphasis on four main areas for continuous improvement


    improving energy efficiency

    reducing greenhouse gas emissions

    maximizing our water efficiency

    caring for the land


we have quantified the risk associated with our key environmental impacts for each business unit utilizing the corporate
risk management process we use this process to assess implications and identify measures that are required to limit
or reduce risk and potential liabilities to an acceptable and manageable level this is in addition to our use of
vermilions corporate risk matrix to assess other types of risk including operational environmental regulatory
compliance and reputational risk g4ec2


we assess risk based on the anticipated impact severity and subsequent probability of an event occurring in
consideration of human environment financial and social license to operate factors we take a
multistakeholder approach to risk assessment including both internal board of directors executive staff and
external landowners ngos investors the general public industry groups such as capp parties


we proactively conduct operational and engineering reviews aimed at increasing efficiency and reducing the emissions
and monetary expenditure requirements at major facilities


we have undertaken a ghg quantification methodologies study and carbon liability analysis for our business units in
canada france the netherlands and australia the carbon liability analysis factors in a number of potential
regulatory price point and taxation changes that are possible over the next three years these documents detail the
current emission generating activities scope 1 2 3 and the liability and risk associated with the carbon footprint of

climate change

there are a number of ways that we integrate the issue of climate change into vermilions
business strategy

    our focus on achieving bestinclass hse drives management support of programs that enhance our environmental
    performance which in turn empowers our people to effect operational change we track our progress on this best
    inclass goal on a monthly quarterly and annual basis and communicate our progress across the business


    we are committed to being compliant in all regulatory regimes across all business units compliance with changing
    regulations planning for forecasted changes and energy efficiency are primary drivers for identification and
    implementation of emission reduction and fuel efficiency related initiatives

    we have altered our project management framework to include aspects of sustainability and climate change 
    including regulatory change water utilization emissions reduction and footprint reduction  resulting in a reduction
    of ecosystem fragmentation our technical teams across the organization communicate with each other collaborate
    on current and upcoming sustainability initiatives and bring in technical expertise to augment project execution

    we annually examine and reassess the risks associated with climate change and the potential effects on our
    operations globally some of the risks we examine include rising sea levels carbon taxation schemes and carbon
    sequestration requirements based on our assessments we adjust our long term operating strategies to ensure
    efficient effective and safe development of the resources in our operating areas examples of this include the
    research and development completed to implement technology that allows for the treatment and reuse of advanced
    gel chemical fracture flowback fluids this approach reduces the requirement for fresh water to complete wells and
    the volume of water being disposed of via deep well injection for facility construction we employ new and efficient
    technology that is adaptable to changing requirements and decreases the impact on the environment an example
    of this is the installation of solar power as a primary power source at a number of the new wells drilled in canada in
    2014 this solar power is augmented with thermoelectric generation teg power units when the region lacks the
    necessary light to produce the amount of energy required g4ec2



several substantial business decisions were made in 2014 to reduce emissions for instance we scoped required
modifications to acquired assets in the netherlands the united states and canada that will allow for a significant
50 reduction in vermilions 2014 emission levels in the medium term this includes a significant capital
commitment in our saskatchewan operation to fund the completion of a gas plant project that is now online with
partners that will support natural gas conservation in the region this is an example of a sustainability project that will
have an impact outside of vermilions operations and result in a reduction in 3rd party emissions as well as vermilions

emissions reduction drivers



there are a number of things that drive our emissions reduction activities including compliance with regulatory
requirements and standards employee engagement and financial optimization calculations g4en19



 compliance with            emissions reductions are driven by yearoveryear reduction expectations defined by the regulators in
 regulatory                 the countries in which we operate
 requirements 
 standards

 employee engagement        emissions reductions are driven by suggestions and input gleaned from staff via our staff update
                            meetings as well as via our regular hse district meetings and town halls staff feedback is taken into
                            account by the groups responsible for management of emissions quantification and sustainability
                            initiatives



 financial optimization     emissions reductions are driven by the optimization activities we undertake in our business units these
 calculations               impacts are identified at the project assessment stage and add value to projects value add and
                            responsible sustainable development of the resources in our operating regions are primary drivers for
                            investment the activities are typically identified by the incountry technical teams


 other                      projects that have multiple benefits including a reduction in emission intensity of our operations factor
                            into vermilions investment selection process many initiatives that support vermilions operational
                            excellence and stewardship also have the effect of reducing emissions associated with our activities
                            through the reduction of fuel or energy these benefits are identified during the investigation phase of a
                            project assessment



here are just some of the recent ways we have reduced our environmental impact by being more energy efficient g4en6


canada
    tieins performed at a number of our canadian assets throughout 2014 have reduced the amount of fluid trucking
    required for example we completed tieins at our cardium singlewell batteries which resulted in a reduction of
    approximately 20000 kilometers of trucking

    electrification of some of our oil sites in southeast saskatchewan and our southern foothills district has reduced
    generator fuel use
    we reconfigured our operations at various liquidsrich gas sites to use solar power as the primary power supply with
    thermal electric power generators as the supplemental supply this reduced the amount of propane fuel required for
    power generation at these locations on an annual basis

france
    at the request of our staff we are creating a tool to link our business travelers together so that staff travelling to the
    same city can travel together thereby reducing cost and the number of vehicles on the road also at the request of
    our fbu staff we are also creating a tool to help promote carpooling for the daily commute

    we are also trialing the use of two electric vehicles by our operators in the aquitaine and paris basins so far the
    results have been very positive in terms of co2 with the vehicles generating zero emissions the challenges we are
    facing with these vehicles include battery duration the battery only lasts 100 kms and the time required to recharge
    the battery approximately 8 hours but we are looking at ways to address these challenges given that each car can
    help us reduce our carbon footprint by approximately 364 tonnes of co2 based on an average mileage of
    approximately 17255 km

    gps devices are installed in all companyowned vehicles approximately 75 in france these devices which help to
    monitor speed have resulted in reductions in fuel consumption

    our operators make daily operations visits to the 28 platforms installed on the lake in parentis we purchased a new
    boat that will help us to reduce our fuel consumption by approximately 10000 litres per year



netherlands
    in 2014 we reorganized our workgroups in the netherlands to minimize the driving distances required to operate
    our wells and facilities we estimate that this has reduced the number of annual kilometers driven by 20 or 96000
    km on an annual basis not only is this making our workplace safer it also has eliminated 19 tonnes of greenhouse
    gases on an annual basis

    we minimize our surface land use footprint through reuse of existing well sites for new drills

    improvements to helicopter flight booking and scheduling in 2014 were implemented to reduce the number of
    helicopter flights to and from wandoo facilities and improve seat utilisation rates

    we commenced work on gas lift compressor realignment in 2014 to improve throughput by 7 with an expected
    increase in fuel consumption of 4 therefore improving the overall production rate per unit of energy consumed
    this project was completed in may 2015

    at our perth office we opened access to the stairwell to enable staff to use the stairs instead of the lift to transfer
    between floors we also improved shower and locker room facilities within the office to encourage more staff to ride
    to work our current office location is close to a major train and bus station as well as bike paths as part of our
    scoping of new office locations we have made a conscious decision to look for properties within the same area to
    enable staff to continue to use public transport

the increase is primarily a result of the acquisitions we                industry
completed in 2014 including the acquisition of our
southeast saskatchewan assets as well as our new
netherlands and united states assets these assets
represent approximately 23 of vermilions combined scope

as per the ghg protocol these calculations reflect an adjustment to base year emissions to allow for a comparison in
terms of operational size


vermilions production also increased by 30 between our 2012 base year and 2014 due to our energy efficiency
programs emission reduction initiatives and our operational design which seeks to maximize production while reducing
our aerial footprint and energy consumption intensity vermilion was able to reduce our energy intensity by 8 on a per
boe produced basis this is based on vermilions reported production of 34676 boed in 2012 and 49573 boed in
2014



fugitive emissions



our active fugitive emissions fe monitoring program is aimed at reducing preventable losses to the atmosphere we
conduct annual fugitive emissions reviews at select major facilities as well as at smaller select locations in canada
france and the netherlands we also undertake reviews of the low pressure venting that occurs at our operations in
australia and use the data to determine appropriate risk mitigation measures in 2012 we initiated a review of
emissions associated with our australia operations and in 2014 we completed an emissions accounting review to
increase the accuracy of our emissions calculations

vermilion complies with all regulatory requirements relating to emission reporting and reduction

reducing flared and vented volumes of gas



in april 2014 we closed the purchase of a small private company with lightoil assets in southeast saskatchewan in
the short period of time that we have owned these assets we have made important improvements that reflect vermilions
focus on safety operational excellence and continuous improvement


a significant focus has been on the nearelimination of flared and vented solution gas at these sites as these assets
accounted for 24 of our scope 1 emissions in 2014 the saskatchewan assets as a whole accounted for 26 of
vermilions total scope 1 emissions and 22 of our global scope 1  2 emissions in 2015 through the construction of
new infrastructure tying our production into gathering systems installing vapour tanks with flares upgrading battery
flares and converting to instrumental air systems we have almost completely eliminated flaring and venting of solution
gas at our southeast saskatchewan assets this is expected to translate into a savings of approximately 120000 metric
tonnes of co2e


in addition to reducing our canadian volumes of flared and vented gas we also took actions to reduce our emissions in
our other business units


france

in 2014 we launched the design of a gas export system at vic bilh aquitaine basin that will be finalized in the second
quarter of 2015


the oil producing field of vic bilh generates an average of 25000 m3day of associated gas which we have been forced
to flare since october 2013 due to the shuttingin of the lacq gas treatment facility operated by another operator with
this facility under new operatorship we will soon be able to resume the sale of the associated gas from our vic bilh
operations which will provide energy to local industrial consumers and will represent a co2 savings of 23000 tonnes



in 2014 we engaged experts to help us determine the feasibility of upgrading the associated gas produced at our
chaunoy and vaudoy oil batteries in the paris basin by producing electricity with a gas engine we have determined that
it is possible to eliminate the flaring of the associated gas and sell the electricity to the local utility company we
anticipate initiating the project in 2015 for completion and startup in late 2016


we estimate that we will be able to generate a total of 36 megawatts which will be able to meet the electricity needs of
approximately 450 homes per year


netherlands


in 2013 we implemented a compressor reconfiguration project at our treatment center in garijp with the intent of
reducing energy consumption and associated emissions these compressors are electrically driven and the project
resulted in an absolute reduction in power consumption of 35 or 3mwh consumption reduced from 8mwh to 5mwh
this is an initiative that on an annual basis will reduce power consumption by 26280 mwh and reduce scope 2
emissions by an estimated 9700 tonnes


vermilion is also planning to examine the potential replacement of gas driven compressors acquired in 2014 with the
goal of reducing the energy intensity through an absolute target of compression in our netherlands operations

water that is naturally present in the wandoo reservoir from which the hydrocarbons are extracted is treated processed
and discharged as produced formation water to manage the water discharge we have developed a produced formation
water and ballast water management framework the objective of the framework is to monitor and manage potential
impacts on the marine environment via routine daily monthly and annual monitoring as well as actions undertaken if
the results exceed the defined threshold values we are also continually working to optimize our operations through

reducing greenhouse emissions with geothermal energy



greenhouse expansion  study parentisenborn france


in 2008 vermilion teamed up with four agricultural engineers
who wanted to create an economically and ecologically viable
greenhouse operation in which to grow tomatoes the result was
the construction of a 10hectare greenhouse that will be heated
without carbon emissions for at least 25 years thanks to the
caloric content from vermilions produced water stream at our
major facility adjacent to the greenhouse in parentisenborn by
demonstrating proofofconcept our partnership with tom daqui
has been credited as being the catalyst for three new projects
launched independently of vermilion in 201415 which have
generated additional economic benefits for the community in
parentis


we believe there are opportunities for other organizations to
apply similar technology and principles in their own operations
this belief coupled with our desire to demonstrate leadership
and excellence in all that we do is why we encouraged avenia
to launch an industry and countrywide study to identify the
potential of recycled energy use from oil and gas operations in
addition to contributing financial support towards the study we
have provided the expertise of our people and have actively
encouraged other companies to participate in the study the
results of the study which also focuses on geothermal potential
will be available to all oil and gas players in france and will be
released following a detailed review by avenia

econeighbourhood la teste france



we signed a 30year partnership in 2015
with a french land developer to provide
heat for up to 450 homes in a newly
planned econeighbourhood complex



construction of the econeighbourhood
which is located in the community of la
teste in the south west of france started
in q2 of 2015 and is expected to be
completed in 2018




how it will work


    vermilion produces oil from three
    fields in the arcachon basin part of
    the aquitaine basin les mimosas les
    pins and      les    arbousiers   the
    production is gathered in a central
    battery where approximately 1000
    m3day of water at a temperature of
    70 degrees is produced daily along
    with the oil




    the installation of a heat exchanger on our battery will allow the transfer of the energy from the produced water to
    the econeighborhood




once construction is complete we anticipate the recycled heat from vermilions produced water source in the arcachon
basin will be able to provide approximately 80 of the heating requirements of these 450 homes

geothermal pilot project the netherlands


in february 2014 we sent a notification letter to the ministry of economic affairs in the netherlands indicating that we
wished to utilize vermilions subsurface hse and drilling expertise to aid in the development of localized geothermal
projects for the benefit of local communities that host our operating activities as well as to create synergies with our
commercial and industrial neighbours


to date we have focused our activities on converting three depleted gas wells in the province of north holland to a
geothermal pilot project to support a regional business park development we have committed nearly 100000 euros to
this project to date and hope to progress this pilot project to the construction phase in 2016


we are also developing geothermal assessment plans on new gas drilling prospects so that a single drilling operation
can address the potential of both natural gas and geothermal energy opportunities it is our belief that combining the
planning and development of natural gas and geothermal opportunities through a single operation provides a net
benefit to all stakeholders since it will ultimately result in more natural gas and geothermal energy opportunities being
pursued to the benefit of both local and national stakeholders

water use

we produce key performance indicators on water use in the performance metrics section of
this report this includes water withdrawal by source and percentage and volume of water
recycled and reused

we endeavor to reduce our potable water consumption wherever possible in february 2015 for example we carried out
a workover at our vic bilh asset in order to convert a suspended oil well into a saline water producing well for injection
support we expect this non potable water reduction initiative will conserve approximately 146000 m3 of potable water
per year

approximately one quarter of the water we pump during a
cardium frac returns immediately during flowback operations
the fracture fluid technology we employ further facilitates the
reuse of the flowback water on subsequent wells this helps us
reduce our water usage by approximately 60000 cubic metres
per year based on 40 wells

we are also working on ways to further reduce the amount of water utilized including adjustments in the completion
schedules in addition flowback water can be recycled to reduce overall makeup water requirements finally we are
also looking at the potential of using produced water nonpotable water produced with oil and gas from our
operations


base of groundwater protection


we operate in accordance with strict regulations and industry recommended practices irps that protect groundwater
sources through exploration and production phases for example petroleum services association of canadas irp 14
ensures that nontoxic waterbased drilling fluid is used when penetrating freshwater aquifers down to the government
established base of groundwater protection then steel casing is put in place and cemented in permanently to isolate
the upper portion of the well while drilling to the final reservoir target



in canada the cardium formation is vermilions shallowest development play where we currently use hydraulic
fracturing practices to stimulate the formation here as in our other areas of operation we employ microseismic and
computer modeling to ensure we are not contacting or impacting potable water aquifers through our activities the
micro seismic events measured during hydraulic fracturing operations indicate the height and extent of the fracture
system we know from this seismic data that a typical hydraulic fracture height in the cardium interval is up to 100
metres we also know that the cardium interval is typically found at 1750 metres below surface and the base of the
deepest groundwater is at approximately 600 metres so we therefore maintain an approximate distance of 1100 metres
from the base of groundwater protection to the top of the hydraulic fracture




ensuring containment


flowback fluids are contained onsite in a closed system where they are later reused or alternatively disposed of at
authorized facilities at the conclusion of a program in addition to accessing current technology in our operations
vermilion has been involved in trialing many new and emerging technologies and invested time and money in an effort
to make them viable


greener additives


we publicly disclose all of the additives we use to fracfocus as well as via our regulatory submissions we continue to
work to decrease the required concentration of our additives and work with our fracturing suppliers to source even
greener alternatives for future considerations


reducing ghg emissions


in early 2014 we met with our primary provider of fracturing services to discuss the application of bifuel frac
pumpers which can burn both diesel and natural gas through cng compressed natural gas or using onsite produced
natural gas in order to decrease our feedstock supply emissions and ultimately our hydrocarbon footprint during our
fracturing programs

caring for the land

we understand our responsibility to be careful stewards of the land


what do dinosaur bones roman ruins and aboriginal traditional sites have
in common with a company like vermilion


the nature of our business means that we work in areas with the potential
to come across some amazing archeological discoveries dinosaur bones in
the us roman ruins in france and aboriginal traditional sites in canada
it also means that we understand our responsibility to be conscientious
stewards of the land its why when these special discoveries occur we
partner with our communities regulators and researchers to play a part in
advancing our collective understanding of the world in which we live



our most recent archeological excavation was a triceratops skull and
other dinosaur bones during the construction of a well pad in our usbu
the excavation was made on federal surface so we called in several
paleontologists to make sure all the digs were executed properly the
fossils are destined for the denver museum of nature and science
                                                                                        recent fossil discovery in the usbu



our surface geology in the us is the cretaceous lance formation and the area of northeast wyoming where we operate is known for
numerous significant dinosaur fossil finds in fact some of the most complete triceratops skeletons in the world have been found in
wyoming this is just another reason why all our construction and well pad operations are performed carefully meeting all regulations
with experts on hand to ensure that archeological items can be identified and preserved


in addition to our fossil discoveries an entirely new species of marine worm has been identified in the
waters off the coast of france thanks to vermilion


when we drilled our well on the aquitaine maritime permit in 2007 we
conducted a sea bed environmental survey the resulting samples along
with location and depth data were analyzed by our environmental
consultants and experts at moscow lomonosov state university they
revealed a new type of bristle worm these worms have protrusions on
each of their body segments that are covered in bristles that has been
named auchenoplax worsfoldi the worms are less than 1 mm in width
and up to 30 mm long and live in tubes in general the family that bristle
worms belong to are found from intertidal regions to a depth of 9 km and
feed on surface deposits


vermilions role in providing both data and material were noted in a
scientific paper published in 2014 that identified the worm which has now
been added to the world register of marine species

minimizing surface footprint


in canada we often employ the use of horizontal wells we usually program these
wells from a single surface location or pad with up to eight wells being drilled from
a single location pad drilling reduces the aerial extent of the well site surface
facilities pipelines and roads to put this in perspective vertical well surface impact
is approximately 17 hectares per well while an eightwell pad surface impact is
only about 05 hectares per well


as the horizontal length of a well gets longer the amount of subsurface area
developed increases originally horizontal well lengths were 1400 metres we are
currently drilling wells with horizontal lengths of up to 3400 metres  thats over 2
miles long in the past one pad site was used to develop about 20 hectares 1400
metres in horizontal length but we are now developing 1000 hectares from a pad
site  up to 3000 metres of horizontal length our pembina stacked play has the
added environmental benefit of being able to share surface infrastructure such as
roads pipelines and processing facilities this higher well density reduces driving
distances and therefore emissions associated with development monitoring and
maintenance of wells it also optimizes equipment and energy used during
development and maintenance of productive reservoirs

with vermilions help large artificial reefs submerged in lake parentisbiscarrosse will
contribute to local biodiversity local recreation and the economy


four treeshaped concrete reefs are now in place in lake parentisbiscarrosse thanks
to vermilions support for transporting and installing them through this national first
in france  the positioning of largescale artificial reefs in a freshwater lake 
vermilion is helping to secure the lakes biodiversity for the future contributing to
both environmental protection and economic development


created specifically for this project the reefs were submerged in may 2015 to create
new fish habitat areas vermilions highcapacity barge provided easy transportation of
the reefs to sites preselected by experts based on factors such as slope depth and
type of lake bed we also provided divers to help with installation


the reef project was launched in 2009 by the landes departmental angling
federation and local fishing associations based on more limited experiments in lakes
at mimizan and cazauxsanguinet

vermilions involvement enabled the partners to expand the scale of the project
compared with previous arrangements in all more than 200 metric tons of inert
concrete shapes which will not release material into the environment will be placed
into lake parentis as reefs as the project continues vermilion will support diving
operations to observe the reefs as they are colonized by both flora and fauna              vermilion is proud to have supported
developing new food chains and fish life if successful new reefs could be                 an environmental first in france
implemented within five years allowing us to continue to support fishing aquatic
environment associations and all the other activities that take place on and around
the lake

approximately 50 people celebrated the first reef submersion with us on may 26
2015 among the attendees were departmental and local elected officials

approval of wandoo facility and well construction environment plans



2014 saw the national offshore petroleum safety and environmental management
authority nopsema acceptance of the wandoo facility environment plan in
september and the well construction environment plan in november under the new
offshore petroleum greenhouse gas storage environment regulations 2009


the objective of the regulations is to ensure that any offshore petroleum or
greenhouse gas activity is carried out in a manner consistent with the principles of
ecologically sustainable development and in a manner by which the environmental
impacts and risks of the activity will be reduced to as low as reasonably practicable
and acceptable levels
                                                                                           vermilion will be undertaking offshore marine

in australia the offshore environmental compliance requirements have improved
over the last five years following the major global spill events the accepted
environment plans outline how vermilion will undertake operations marine projects
and drilling activities at wandoo to meet these improved standards this was
achieved through significant input from the operations engineering drilling and
project teams within vermilion


we will be undertaking offshore marine monitoring in 2015 within the wandoo
field monitoring will include the characterization of the epifauna using a remotely
operated vehicle rov water sampling and sediment sampling to


    obtain data to support wandoo discharge modelling and impact analysis

    obtain additional baseline data for future impact assessments

    establish environmental data to support asset retirement planning


the program was developed to identify vermilions potential impacts on the marine environment in order to achieve further
improvements in environmental management if required as a major stakeholder in the region it is vermilions responsibility to the wider
community to assist in maintaining the health of the regional environment

ways of caring

strategic investment in our communities is
part of vermilions corporate dna and helps
us fulfill our mission of delivering superior
rewards to investors employees partners
and the communities in which we operate


our people care about their communities and they expect
vermilion to care too according to our 2015 great place to work
results pride in the ways that we give back to the community is
the top scoring item by staff within our annual great place to work
survey participation


through our vermilion ways of caring program we give back we give time and we give together this approach to
community investment exemplifies the vermilion way of getting things done  through leadership embracing
responsibility and achieving excellence


our approach to community investment has been recognized by a number of our community partners including
the town of drayton valley

we are thrilled to see the investment vermilion energy has generated not only through financial contribution but also the
ambassadors the employees locally have become for our program in the community i dont believe that there has been a sponsorship
model like vermilions in this community prior to vermilion coming on board  it can certainly be asserted that vermilion has been
influential within the last two years the town has been approached by several companies interested in building a sponsorship built
around meaningful engagement i believe that this has occurred because of how vermilion energy has established its sponsorship
program within the ecdc early childhood development centre

give back


in 2014 our cash investments totalled over 1 million globally and focused
on our four key investment areas


    homelessness  poverty we work with social investment agencies that
    support the most vulnerable in our community through measurable
    impactful programs to break the cycle of poverty and homelessness
    because we believe healthy vibrant communities include all community
    members in their success

    health and safety promotion we invest in resultsoriented programs that enhance the wellbeing and
    safety of individuals and communities sharing our bestinclass approach to a health and safety culture
    that is fully integrated into every facet of vermilions operations

    environmental stewardship we partner with organizations that use sciencebased best practices to
    enhance environmental conservation and education contributing to healthy resilient sustainable
    communities today and in the future

    celebrating vermilions cultures we support the local cultures of our diverse locations to ensure that
    their traditions and contributions are recognized and preserved




give time


we provide funding for the wide variety of nonprofit and charitable organizations
that our staff support through their personal volunteer time in 2014 65 grants
were issued in recognition of the over 8800 hours our people invested of their
own time towards the causes and community organizations that meant the most to
them we attribute the significant increase in number of grants in 2014 to the
structural changes we have made to the program which has made the grants
more accessible to staff as well as our increased focus on promoting this program
to staff globally




give together


we encourage our people to spend up to two days per year volunteering on
company time as part of a team or corporate day of caring project these
handson opportunities help us to not only put caring into action but also help
to build genuine and authentic relationships between our people and between
our company and the communities where we operate

in 2014 nearly 200 staff in canada europe and australia took part in corporate and team days of caring
this represented over 2000 volunteer hours during company time which we value conservatively to be worth
150000 in time alone while staff in canada france and australia have had the opportunity to participate in
days of caring for several years 2014 marks the first year that day of caring activities were planned in the
netherlands it was such a successful project that we are making plans to broaden our 2015 day of caring in
the netherlands to all geographic regions in which we operate with a focus on supporting food banks and
environmental conservation projects

in 2014 vermilion and ywca staff partnered to create and pilot a mock interview program for clients of the employment
resource centre the goal is to provide erc clients with an opportunity to participate in mock interview sessions at
vermilions calgary offices to help these individuals gain the practice and confidence they need to put their best foot
forward in realworld interview settings ultimately we hope this preparation will help lead to better employment
outcomes for these individuals for vermilion this presents an opportunity for staff to volunteer and develop or further
hone their skills as interviewers as well as an opportunity to continue to influence vermilions standardized interview
approach and client experience

60th anniversary of parentis field discovery

2014 marked the 60th anniversary of the discovery of the parentis field in france



as frances top oil producer and most active oil and gas company we
were proud to partner with the local community on an exhibition
celebrating this important milestone and piece of our culture


the exhibitions main objective was to highlight the pioneers who made
the first oil discovery in parentis that revolutionized daily life in this small
rural and picturesque town it is through their investment and audacity
that vermilion was able to make its foray into france in 1997


the exhibition also provided an opportunity for us to showcase our
people who work hard every day to responsibly extract the high quality
oil from this field their integrity technical expertise and environmental
stewardship mindset demonstrate that they too are pioneers leading the
way for new ways of responsible and sustainable resource development in
the country


in addition to our financial support of this event several of our employees volunteered their time and energy through our
days of caring program and we helped create a commemorative video that shares the stories of past and present
industry pioneers


a commemorative stamp was created for the exhibition which ran for six days and was attended by 900 visitors 70
from parentis suggesting this was indeed an important cultural celebration for the entire community

days of caring around the world

drayton valley alberta

16 staff in drayton valley spent two days in june 2014
planting a living fence at the early childhood
development centre ecdc to help keep kids safe

a living fence provides many of the same safety
features as a manufactured fence but because it is a
tightly planted permanent hedge it provides almost
instant greenery that beautifies the landscape it also
has the potential of outlasting many manufactured
fences

this is just one of the many volunteer projects that we
have undertaken as part of our vpowered kids
partnership established in 2012 at the ecdc we are
very proud of the fact that through our involvement we
have been able to help spirit new programs enable
workshops and special events for families within our
community as well as aid in establishing a family
coach position within the centre

in addition to other team days of caring carried out at
the ecdc in 2014 we also organized projects in support
of evergreen elementary school in drayton valley and
the northern haven womens shelter in slave lake

discussion of management approach
under gris g4 framework each of vermilions nine identified material aspects under the specific standard disclosures
section requires a discussion of management approach or dma which in turn requires three main elements


    1  what makes the aspect material

    2  how do we manage the aspect

    3  how do we evaluate our management approach and does this lead to adjustments


much of this information is contained in our materiality analysis and within the report text however to make this easier
to locate in the report we have summarized the dmas for each aspect below these include why we selected the aspect
as material how we manage evaluate and adjust as needed where operational responsibility lies within vermilion and
