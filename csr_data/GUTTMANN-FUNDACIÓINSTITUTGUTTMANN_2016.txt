2   institut guttmann 2016 annual report  corporate social responsibility report

presentation

we are pleased to present the 2016 social report of the institut guttmann which includes for the
first time the corporate social responsibility csr report which has been recently recog
nised by the fundación avedis donabedian for its rigour and transparency

this report is the result of combining in a single document the social report that our foundation
had been publishing annually since 1989 with the csr report based on the gri model that we pub
lished for the first time last year the scope and complexity of the information it contains and the
possibility of offering it in a more agile interactive and understandable way has led us to opt for a
digital edition available through our website and to no longer print a traditional paper version we
believe that this initiative is more efficient and adapts better to the potential of the modern informa
tion society and our institutions environmental commitment

despite the inherent difficulties and uncertainties of the complex modern society and sociopolitical
times in which we live 2016 allowed us to meet most of the care scientific and social objectives that
we had set ourselves for the financial year it was a year in which the human factor was key to our
organisations success with an excellent team of highly competent and responsible professionals
who are committed to the institut guttmann the values it represents and the goals it pursues

in 2016 we can see how we have been gradually making progress in our ambitious 20142020
strategic plan that has now passed the halfway mark the strategic objectives of the plan are
being met demonstrating our foundations vitality and rigour as well as its capacity to innovate the
organisation gains the necessary strength to advance day by day with enthusiasm and persever
ance thanks to the recognition and affection that we receive from our patients and their families
as well as the many friends of the institut guttmann who through their generous and continued
support help us deliver on our original objectives especially the most daring and innovative ones

of all the actions carried out in 2016 we would like to highlight the following for their special signifi
cance

i we have deepened and strengthened the foundations organisational structure in order to deal
with future challenges that we face especially with regard to the forthcoming implementation of
the guttmann project  la sagrera therefore in addition to reinforcing the first executive level
of the organisation with the incorporation of a manager we have redefined the managerial and
governance structure to gain in transversality and greater functionality whilst providing a small tech
nical support area we have also launched the clinical innovation and applied research com
mittee to improve the coordination between knowledge generation and innovation and its rapid
integration into clinical practice

ii the foundation is committed to corporate social responsibility as a comprehensive inclusive
participatory and more transparent policy that is committed to people and the environment and is
oriented towards the sustainability of the organisation

it should be made absolutely clear from the outset that for the institut guttmann csr is not a prod
uct of design nor a strategic marketing decision but the logical consequence of a long process of
coherently deepening its social commitment to the values that guide its decisionmaking csr has
formed and forms part of the dna of the institut guttmann inspiring all its actions and permeating
the behaviour and attitudes of its whole personnel team

in 2016 and in accordance with what we announce we carried out all the work required to make
effective our membership of the global compact and the economy for the common good in



                                 institut guttmann 2016 annual report  corporate social responsibility report   3

    presentation



    2017 we committed to proceeding with sr10 accreditation and the audited selfevaluation of the
    economy for the common good that is found in the last chapter of this document

    iii our total quality policy continued and the following audits were passed favourably during the
    financial year the iso 14001 environmental certification the emas european environmental certifi
    cation the spanish law on the protection of personal data lopd and the requirements of the
    ministry of health as a csur in spinal cord injury at the same time we have made progress in the
    preparation of the fifth reaccreditation of joint commission international which ensures the safety
    and quality of health organisations

    iv the planned care activity was carried out with a small increase in demand from other funding
    sources not catsalut especially in relation to programmes of the initiative guttmann neuroperson
    alclínic

    in quantitative terms a total of 4769 people was seen of which 807 were hospitalised of all the
    patients seen 1043 22 were attending for the first time this shows how attractive our hospital is
    to patients this trend is also evident in the number of foreign patients a total of 81 chose our hospi
    tal to receive the specialist care they needed the childrens rehabilitation unit saw a total of 326
    children and teenagers up to 16 years old

    on a qualitative level the pilot of the programme expert caregiver in acquired brain damage of
    the department of health was launched as a pioneer on a national level we also continued the
    postdischarge support programme for people affected by acquired brain damage and their fam
    ilies in the community environment we also improved the overall rating of quality perceived by
    hospitalised patients which stood at 905 out of 10 88 in 2015

    v we have been able to improve the remuneration of our professionals as agreed with our work
    council with an increase of 3 on the salary items of the agreement approximately between 1
    and 3 for each professional this is a slight but totally fair salary increase after a period of seven
    years in which it was necessary to freeze it due to the economic crisis and the adjustment of tariffs
    by catsalut

    vi the research and innovation programmes were reformulated favouring their transversality and
    intensifying their orientation to clinical translation identifying needs to guide new projects and as
    sessing the results of the research specifically we should highlight the barcelona brain health initia
    tive bbhi programme led by professor álvaro pascualleone a harvard professor and scientific
    advisor at the institut guttmann thanks to funding provided by the social programme of la caixa
    and also by the abertis foundation as well as the methodological support of harvard catalyst re
    searchers also of interest is the first implantation of mesenchymal stem cells in patients with chronic
    spinal cord injury in a study promoted by tv3s la marató and joining the neurotec network re
    search network on neurotechnologies for care and rehabilitation

    regarding scientific production in 2016 we worked on 97 research projects 11 corresponding to
    public calls and 13 doctoral theses in total we published 24 indexed articles with an accumulated
    impact factor of 665 9 in the first quarter and presented a total of 52 papers to 31 scientific and
    technical forums in spain and internationally

    in relation to the teaching activity a total of 203 students took part in teaching programmes of the
    university institute of which 25 correspond to new registrations in the masters degree in neurore
    habilitation 25 in the masters degree in neuropsychological rehabilitation and cognitive stimula
    tion and 72 other postgraduate courses accredited by the uab additionally we helped to train
    27 resident intern consultants mainly in physical medicine and rehabilitation 1 resident intern psy
    chologist and up to 47 undergraduate students in different disciplines linked to the world of neuro
    rehabilitation

  abertis foundation under the title empowerment personal autonomy and neuroethics brought
  together more than 300 professionals and public and private care service managers for people with
  disabilities or dependency
 accident prevention activities especially the game over dont risk it all campaign which with
  the support of the catalan traffic service allowed us to conduct 932 talks in 403 schools across
  catalonia to more than 50000 teenagers and young people with a message encouraging pru
  dence mainly when driving vehicles and doing extreme sports in addition in the field of road
  safety we established a collaboration agreement with the racc focusing on researching the
  cognitive functions and learning processes related to safe driving
 with regard to the promotion of adapted and inclusive sport we carried out a number of initiatives
  such as the 12th edition of move and youll see the 12th edition of the sports games of the
  institut guttmann the signing of a collaboration agreement with the fundació tommy robredo
  for the promotion of wheelchair tennis or the second year of the educational programme co
  loured dolphins
 finally we have promoted the sports  life guttmann club initiative this is a new programme
  that offers a space for social recreational cultural and sports activities for former patients of our
  hospital who accompanied by their families andor friends want to do participative activities in a
  mainstream environment with coordination and supervision from our physical education staff

viii once the laborious process of selecting the construction company and signing the contract
was completed we began work on the guttmannla sagrera project simultaneously to starting
construction of the new building we negotiated with different clinical operators to find potential
partners to carry out the care side of the project whilst starting legal studies to find the best fit of
potential partners and our professionals alike in the activities that are to be carried out in addition
the different areas of care and the team of professionals of the guttmann neuropersonalclínic
initiative the activity that is to be transferred to the new centre were consolidated

ix finally of note is our participation in tv3s 25th la marató which was dedicated to research into
ictus and spinal cord and acquired brain injuries as well as the filming of the filmax production
100 metres directed by marcel barrena and starring dani rovira the film tells the inspirational story
of a man affected by multiple sclerosis and involved patients and professionals from the rehabilita
tion department in which different sequences of the film were filmed

so far a description has been made of the actions summarised in this presentation as being most
representative of all the activities carried out by the institut guttmann throughout 2016 these actions
have allowed us to continue promoting the clinical leadership of our hospital as an international
reference centre for neurorehabilitation while strengthening the role of our university institute as a
centre for the generation and transfer of knowledge in this scientific field

this series of actions has also made 2016 a special year another year in which the institut guttmann
has carried out its work with the strength and passion that characterises us with the pride of feeling
useful in helping the people who need our services and with the conviction that we are meeting
our institutional mission and through this contributing to the progress of our society and our country

to everybody who has contributed in one way or another to make this possible many many thanks

     amongst these alliances we could highlight various cooperation strategies with many associations
     for people with neurological disabilities for whom the institute works some of them are part of the
     social and participation council of the institut guttmann and are therefore actively involved in
     defining the institutes operational objectives and improving internal processes

              the institut guttmann bases its alliances on the tenets of fairness and transparency that
              pursue the institutes objectives and seek mutual benefit refusing any relationship or
              association with other organisations that may cause conflict with its aims objectives and
              values




     supplier relationships

     in addition in all cases suppliers of goods and subcontractors follow the same procedure for selec
     tion and adjudication within a framework of free competition and excluding any relationship or in
     terference outside the interests of the organisation the institut guttmann always demands recipro
     cal honesty in its commercial relations full respect for current regulations and in particular that
     which refers to the compulsory hiring of people with disabilities also relevant are those that refer to
     the protection of children environmental protection and labour protection

training for patients and their families

the support guidance and information programmes aimed at patients under treatment and their
families are tools applied by the institut guttmann to help minimise the perceived threat of losses
suffered after a neurological inj ury and leverage resources available to address the new situation
facilitating their process of recovery and adaptation


training sessions for patients

the institut guttmann offers patients a place to receive basic information on health issues related to
disability and how to approach it emotionally conducted by a neuropsychologist they combine
educational and therapeutic aspects along with mutual support for people who have j ust suffered
a severe neurological inj ury


training sessions for families

relatives of people with neurological disabilities suffer a major impact and must deal with the phys
ical and neuropsychological changes emotional psychological cognitive and behavioural arising
from the neurological inj ury the relationships that had been established between its members are
modified and the expectations and objectives of the family unit are disrupted the family should
therefore be considered aided accompanied and assisted both in the early stages of rehabilitation
and in the later stages

the family is seen as a key element in the rehabilitation of the person affected by a disability of neu
rological origin therefore the institut guttmann offers educational support guidance and informa
tion programmes aimed at patients families

     in 2016 159 adult patients completed their intensive and specialised neurorehabilitation process
     66 of whom had paraplegia and 34 of whom had tetraplegia in 685 of cases the injury was
     incomplete their mean age was 50

      at the end of the care process 91 of patients returned to their usual residence whilst 9 required
       an institutional alternative on a temporary or permanent basis over the past 10 years this percen
       tage has remained steady with minimal variations mean 898

      two years after clinical discharge only 55 of patients were readmitted for any complication
       resulting from their disability mainly related to urology trauma reconstructive surgery etc

      regarding the functionality achieved the tables below show how our patients achieved functio
       nal levels equal to those expected for the level of their injury and equivalent to those achieved at
       the main rehabilitation centres in europe and the united states

 we measured functionality using the internationally validated functional independence measure
  fim scale and by grouping patients according to the neurological level of the asia american
  spinal injury association scale which is the international classification of spinal cord injuries and
  groups their severity into grades a b c and d this subsequently allowed us to compare our outco
  mes with those of the main hospitals in the united states

the fim scale measures the patients capacity for independence in performing activities of daily living adls the fim has a range of values from
                                                                                                                                               
13 to 91 points  the higher the score the better the patients level of motor functionality the sci model was excerpted from outcomes following
traumatic spinal cord injury clinical practice guidelines for healthcare professionals consortium for spinal cord medicine 1999



to be able to compare ourselves in functionality at the european level we used the spinal cord
independence measure scim iii the functional assessment scale used by the european multi
center study about spinal cord injury emsci an association featuring the best european rehabilita
tion hospitals including ours as the figure below shows patients at the institut guttmann achieve
outcomes equivalent to those of the other hospitals studied

outcomes two 2 years and five 5 years after clinical discharge

rehabilitation takes on its true meaning and usefulness in health care when it allows people to
maximise their functional autonomy and go about their lives with dignity independence quality of
life and active social participation despite their limitations and functional differences for this to be
possible it must be ensured that everyone receives excellent highquality rehabilitation although it
is essential to have an inclusive society with inclusive laws that respect differences and actively help
create genuinely equal opportunities

that is what we strive to measure through the regular assessments that we perform on all our patients
sci and abd two and five years after they complete their rehabilitation process at our hospital
these regular assessments not only rule out any disease resulting from their injury that might go un
detected they also assess the patients autonomy quality of life and degree of social participation
among other aspects
