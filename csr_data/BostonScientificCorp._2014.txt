bay area california facility recognizes sustainability success
launched in 2013 the environmental sustainability project award was developed to
recognize individuals who make a meaningful contribution in reducing their sites
environmental footprint rethinking local processes and eliminating material use and
waste at the facility the bay area california project team eliminated the use of disposal
tacky mats and shoe covers in select locations within the campus and replaced them
with washable control mats the project resulted in reduced materials use waste

working to reduce environmental
footprint upstream and downstream

at boston scientific we work to reduce environmental impacts in our manufacturing processes through use
of less energy and materials minimizing our generation of waste and reusing or recycling waste where
possible we also recognize the value of reducing the aggregate environmental impacts by considering both
upstream and downstream aspects focusing on an upstream aspect such as packaging materials can reduce
the footprint of those materials focusing on a downstream aspect such as packaging design can reduce
impact at customer sites

optimizing packaging materials                                                                       7090

tunity to reduce the environmental impacts associated with this material boston scientific
worked with suppliers to optimize the use of postconsumer recycled content pcrc without
impacting the packagings strength or durability characteristics our secondary packaging now contains 7090
pcrc materials representing the elimination of a significant amount of virgin fiberboard materials

reducing packaging waste at our customer locations
packaging is a critical aspect of a medical device ensuring that the device arrives ready to use without impacts
from transportation andor storage packaging can be developed to reduce the environmental footprint at our
customers locations by minimizing the amount of packaging used and labeling packaging to promote and allow
for recycling below are examples of boston scientific packaging projects completed in 2013

                the endoscopy business completed and implemented a packaging redesign for its gastro
                 biopsy forceps product lines the project resulted in an annual packaging materials
   reduction of   reduction of 21 tons package sizes that were 2439 smaller and the conversion of
  21 tons         the inner pouch to a more recyclable material

              the neuromodulation business undertook a redesign of their product outer
      carton    packaging converting to a stronger but lighter material by the end of 2013
    reduction    over 99 of this product packaging had been converted resulting in an annual carton
   21 tons       material reduction of over 21 tons
