                                                              there is a limit to how far management can go in pursuing return

                                  zines ms fujisawa is making efforts to create a new                                        proposals for the introduction of responsible investing in
                                  society by way of the media                                                                 such areas as disclosing information about climate risk
                                                                                                                               for investors and public pensions




   fujisawa despite the fact that funding is truly needed the ability of                      there needs to be a change towards bold ideas concerning the pursuit
   companies to raise capital is difficult at the moment while there are                       of profits in leveraged management major questions must be dealt
   many expected roles to be played by the government if investment                            with although the desire exists to take on big projects to achieve profits
   banks and nations are to cooperate with each other further what are the                     this in itself is starting to come under question by a growing number of
   first things that must be considered                                                        people particularly among the younger generation

   goto first the areas that contribute to industrial growth must be thor                    fujisawa i believe that is important for japan as a developed nation to
   oughly analyzed and subsequently consulting should perhaps take                            show the world its intent to find solutions for problems associated with
   place on the basis of surveys if our research shows that these markets                     an aging population and environmental issues as china and india devel
   and companies can contribute to industrial growth efforts should be                         op they will likely be directly confronted with the same issues it would
   made to raise capital                                                                       be great if japan could make use of its financial tools to be an ideal social
                                                                                                role model for the world 20 years from now in order to do this japan
   mizuguchi taking a global perspective the problems related to ade                         should start by changing the attitudes of its own citizens
   quate food and safe water sources ecological and other issues are enor
   mous yet because businesses do not feel that they have a duty to                           muto within the movement to reform global financial rules what
   confront such problems the mechanisms for providing funds in these                          contributions japan can make to this in relation to america and europe
   areas have not been exploited a social vision must emerge that aims to                      has become another challenge although japan has not shown much
   make small changes in such attitudes examines ways to allow people to                       skill in creating these types of international rules the opportunity is at
   live securely and fosters a society that can provide prosperity for people                   hand to attempt this
   in developing countries is this not the role of countries and leading com                       moreover because japan makes excessive use of indirect finance
   panies for example remarks have been made regarding overseas finan                        compared with other countries there is still a potential for securities busi
   cial institutions creating networks to combat risks associated with climate                  nesses that support direct finance
   change to that end i would like to see japanese financial institutions
   creating links across industries and taking on a leadership role as well                    mizuguchi just as ms fujisawa mentioned if solutions can be pre
                                                                                                sented for social problems through the use of finance understanding
   fujisawa since wages in developing countries remain low investment                         regarding the nature of finance and investments will increase as this
   efficiency tends to be low as well if that is the case can financial prod                 understanding spreads business chances are sure to follow
   ucts be made by gathering tiny investments and using financial innova                            in the case of finance and investment i believe the key word here is
   tion cannot securitization and leverage be used in these areas                             trust in the past business transactions were made based on facetoface
        for example there is a fund in switzerland that invests in micro                       relationships with the spread of globalization however this is no longer
   finance and manages the assets and pensions of wealthy europeans                          the case in addition although it takes a long time to develop trust it can
   this can be done in japan as well                                                           be lost in an instant indeed i believe that trust is gained through a multi

   goto firstly creating investment products out of micro finance invest
   ments poses challenges in such areas as riskreturn and the amount of                        muto the trust of consumers and investors cannot be gained over
   funds necessary to formulate these products however it is necessary for                   night rather it is a matter of how it is fostered with csr in mind it is
   example to develop mechanisms that contain incentives based on prefer                      extremely important to gain and sustain the trust of local communities

     but also increased efficiency in such tasks as material distributions and
     keeping meeting records it is also possible to maintain a high level of
     security thanks to the ability to consolidate the management of meet

    in addition to revising the title and csr key issues the 2009 csr report contains many areas in which innovations have
    been tried including employees telling their own stories with a focus on workplace realities as well as providing information
    in separate booklet and websitebased forms
        these actions have made me aware of the greater appeal inherent in making this report easy for the reader to under
    stand and fully profiling the concept underlining the daiwa securities groups approach to csr to be specific each
    executive and employee has become more serious about making a contribution to a sustainable society through finance
    which is our primary business
         the comment made by professor fujii as a thirdparty that we have taken csr to a higher level serves as a constant
    evaluation of these new initiatives and has left me with a feeling of empowerment to face the future
         regarding csr activities to be undertaken from now on because we are determined to take on new challenges we will
    strive to make improvements based on the opinions of professor fujii and the evaluations received from our stakeholders
