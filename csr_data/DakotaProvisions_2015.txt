the dakota provisions story

dakota turkey growers llc aka dakota provisions llc manufactures and produces poultry
and protein products that are specially designed for retail and food service partners located just
east of the james river dakota provisions was founded by a coop of growers most of whom
are members of hutterite communities

the mission of dakota provisions is

owned by growersmanaged by professionalsdriven by customers

dakota provisions was founded with a focus on the family farm a commitment to quality and
the dedication to building a worldclass facility in huron sd our commitment carries on to
delivering the highest quality product to you our customer leading the industry in food safety is
our no 1 objective the plant employs over 800 employees and plans to employ more within the
next few years

dakota provisions came from the vision of 44 turkey growers who were looking for new ways to
keep their family turkey farms thriving the growers realized that for their farms to survive they
needed to not only grow but also to process the turkey they raised under the leadership of
kenneth d rutledge who had 31 years of experience in poultry processing the growers
invested in a technologically advanced processing facility in huron south dakota

the dakota provisions processing plant opened in december 2005 what began as a grassroots
effort of 44 growers across the heart of the midwest has turned into a worldclass processing
facility that produced 312 million pounds of product in 2014

dakota provisions is devoted to the heritage and survival of our family farmers many of whom
are members of hutterite colonies with more than 120 million invested in their own stateof
theart live turkey production facilities the dakota turkey growers formed dakota provisions in
2004 to help preserve their farms

as the first new processing facility built from the ground up in 20 years we have dedicated
ourselves to not only meeting regulatory demands but exceeding them just a few of the unique
features that set us apart are the following extensive food safety training for employees a
governmentassisted program to verify employee eligibility segregated raw and cooked areas
with no transition available between areas and microresistant wall and floor surfaces

governance and our commitment to corporate responsibility
the strategic plan incorporates a balanced approach needed to realize a 10 per year average annual
foreseeable growth in volume without sacrificing the health of the environment or the community in
which it operates and serves we follow gaap standards usdafsis regulations fda regulations and
epa regulations we use the everify system and background checks as part of our evaluation process
for applicants before they are hired new processing companies traditionally enter the marketplace
according to commodity meat prices which is risky dakota provisions model of entering with value
added sliced products avoids a lot of the associated market volatility as a new company shortterm goals
included maintaining certain quality standards enforcing security mechanisms managing natural market
volatilities and sustaining a strong workforce the companys longterm financial strategy is fixed on
distributing 70 of its volume to be sold further processed and 30 to be sold raw but in 2014 these
percentages were actually flipped with changes in poultry prices as poultry processing generally carry a
number of risks associated with contamination and the health and safety of the animal the environment
the workforce and the consumer continued emphasis on taking a proactive role in minimizing overall
impacts the companys model of prioritizing quality health and safety environmental and human
resources at the forefront of business objectives contributes to its economic performance

warehouses and an employee market which are all located in huron sd ken rutledge presidentceo
