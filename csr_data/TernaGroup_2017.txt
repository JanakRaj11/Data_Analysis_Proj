              and the chief executive officer




              the sustainability report that we are presenting provides further information about the positive results
              achieved by the terna group in 2016 in terms of sustainability and displayed in the groups integrated
              report in line with the last years the contents of this letter are similar to those which introduce the
              financial statements in the belief that performance in sustainability as well as in operations and financial
              and economic aspects is central for stakeholders in understanding and evaluating ternas progress and
              prospects

              we are proud to present you solid results for 2016 confirming that terna is well on track to achieve 2017
              2021 strategic plan targets

              as you know the electricity market is changing rapidly driven by new challenges such as decarbonisation
              market efficiency and security of supply which have been included into specific targets by the european
              commission to ensure that europe will have secure affordable and climatefriendly energy

              terna thanks to its positioning at the heart of the italian electricity market can play a strategic role
              facilitating the energy transition towards a more efficient and cleaner energy production and guarantying
              security of supply at the lowest price for families and enterprises

              we have planned 4bn of investments in the next five years on the national electricity grid to enable this
              energy transition with an annual average increase of 30 vs the old plan the new capex plan has been
              developed according to the new costbenefit analysis cba 20 which includes significant environmental
              and social kpis thus granting higher sharing of value creation with relevant stakeholders
              as a consequence our regulated asset base rab will continue to show a positive trend with 2 annual
              growth reaching 156bn in 2021

              innovation will be crucial on this path and is becoming more and more significant within our business
              plan targets our commitment is taking up this challenge through the adoption of a model based on
              partnerships with startups  small enterprises academy  research centres and our suppliers

              we aim to turn these new market trends into strategic initiatives with a strong commitment to a sustainable
              approach and always leveraging on our core competencies and talents

                                                                        letter of the chairwoman and the chief executive officer   11



we are also enhancing our commitment to nonregulated activities where the annual ebitda contribution
will increase by 40 on average vs the old plan for a cumulated target of 350mn in 5 years

with regard to dividends the policy presented in the previous plan has been confirmed and extended
to the broader 20172021 period with an annual 3 dividend growth in line with the expected earnings
evolution

those targets are based on solid results as the past growth trend was confirmed also in 2016
indeed revenues were up by 1 year on year  at 21bn and ebitda and group net income increased
reaching 1545mn and 633mn respectively
thanks to the strong cash flow generation net debt decreased vs last year and is now just below 8bn
this is the first net debt reduction yearonyear since the ipo

financial performance is well supported by esg results which are strategic for our business model
in 2016 terna further improved its environmental and social performance most notably the leakage rate
of the greenhouse gas sf6 dropped to an unprecedented 039 contributing to a 72 reduction in the
groups direct co2 emissions grid development made it possible to remove 290 km of old lines 904 km
since 2010 with positive effects on land use and improved visual impact investment in human capital is
well represented by the level of employee training which increased to 61 hours per capita 56 in 2015 well
above the average for ftse mib listed companies as for integrity in business conduct terna has become
the first italian company to be iso37001 certified for its sound anticorruption practices

we are perfectly aware of the impacts of our decisions on communities with its pivotal role in the
electricity system terna has to guarantee quality of service for final consumers at the lowest price our
commitment is to reach this objective while improving our environmental and social performance as well
in line with our participation in the un global compact we communicate with all stakeholders such as
national authorities municipalities unions and associations in order to align the interests of the company
to social needs this is essential to drive longterm sustainable value creation for shareholders as well as
growth and prosperity for all stakeholders

     results and objectives

     the results obtained by the terna group in 2016 which are described in this report are based on the
     guidelines of the strategic plan the multiyear planning document that is approved by the board of
     directors every year and presented to analysts as part of a dedicated event the strategic plan has been
     supported by additional tools including the sustainability plan and the threeyear innovation research
     and development plan which was published for the first time in 2015 and extended in 2016 for details
     see the relevant box on page 117
     sustainability is the common denominator that represents a crucial driver especially for medium and
     longterm objectives
     the sustainability plan contains the terna groups biannual objectives on environmental social and
     relational issues concerning stakeholders
     the plan identifies the relevant activities in order to systematise business growth from a sustainability
     perspective with the aim of

             ensuring a gradual and continuous longterm improvement of terna group sustainability
              performance to integrate and support the business objectives set forth in its strategic plan
             protecting and consolidating the reputational capital of the group with specific reference to
              investors attentive to aspects of sustainability and more generally speaking in line with model 231
              and italian law 262

     the sustainability plan 20152016 also invokes the main objectives stated in other documents particularly
     the plan of engagement which collects the initiatives to be achieved in order to structure awareness of
     stakeholders opinions and expectations assess the fulfilment thereof and maintain an appropriate level
     of dialogue see page 62
     the 20152016 sustainability plan is divided into four sections main objectives supporting projects
     annual activities that respond to specific purposes for example improvements that emerged from
     examining sustainability rating agencies questionnaires improved reporting and internal awareness

             the review of the materiality matrix the creation of the first annual monitoring of the state of relations
              with stakeholders
             the identification of kpis that are in line with the materiality analysis already used in this report and in
              the integrated report some of these kpis will also form the foundation of the new sustainability plan
             the creation of a cycle of four seminars for senior managers and a selection of terna junior
              executives on the main problems concerning social inequality and environmental sustainability

     structure of the report

     the arrangement of the 2016 report  although in compliance with grig4 guidelines  departs from
     previous editions to adopt a thematic layout that is more coherent with the one used in the integrated
     report inspired by the framework implemented by the iirc in 2013
     the first chapter 2016 report  summary acts more and more like an executive summary of the entire
     report and as such contains the highlights significant events and results and objectives of the year in
     order to offer a clear and comprehensive view of the year in question in just a few pages
     the terna company profile in line with the integrated report has been enhanced with elements
     from the electricity context and introduces large crosscutting issues for the entire group in addition to
     sustainability it also includes innovation governance risk management protection of the law corruption
     prevention and lastly the supply chain
     the content of the relations with stakeholders chapter has been extended with respect to previous
     reports for each individual category of stakeholder the economic components that characterise the
     relationship are highlighted next to a description of the most relevant activities that year this was
     previously given in a separate chapter economic responsibility which has been removed
     the report includes five chapters dedicated to the electricity service the environment and
     personnel in order to make the report easier to read the information regarding the grig4 indicators
     is signalled by the related code in the margin of the text next to the relevant passages or next to the title
     if the entire section is considered relevant
     as in the 2015 edition environmental data consumption of electricity natural gas water and fuel and
     social statistics injuries regarding the tamini group are published separately the data are shown in the
     key indicator tables on page 209
     the report concludes with an annex section that includes the key indicator tables with a summary
     of the grig4 indicators supplemented by additional indicators the gri content index with two tables
     including the grig4 indicators and the global compact indicators in the first and the sdgs targets and
     grig4 indicators in the second as well as the methodological note for the meaning of technical terms
     specific to the electricity industry see the glossary on the website wwwternait on the tools page using

     reading approaches

     this year once again the interests of the various terna stakeholders regarding the passages in the report that
     concern them most directly has guided some editorial choices the most important information being found in the
     information boxes and comparisons sections or in some cases entire chapters dedicated to stakeholder issues

      2016 data is provisional




     demand for electricity in italy
     in 2016 the demand for electrical energy in italy was 310251 million kwh provisional data reporting a
     fall of 21 in comparison with 2015 which conversely ended with an increase compared to 2014 the
     electricity demand recorded this year takes us back to the same level as 2014
     temperatures were slightly higher than 2015 during the winter months and lower during the summer
     months of that year leading to an overall reduction in demand with regard to the 2016 calendar the two
     fewer working days were almost compensated for by the extra day provided by the leap year
     production from renewable sources covered 34 of national requirements

electricity transmission

although the end users of the electricity service are not direct customers of terna but rather are
companies that distribute and sell electricity the essential role it performs in the electricity system makes
terna ethically responsible for the service with regard to italian society in ternas view business and
sustainability matters are closely linked which is substantiated by the adoption of a responsible approach
to management of the ntg
the main business of the terna group is the transmission and dispatching of electricity in italy regulated
activities playing the role of the italian tso transmission system operator in a monopoly position
through government concession
the italian electricity system consists of four stages producing transmitting distributing and selling
electricity




3 renewable production can be defined as total production from wind solar geothermoelectric biomass included in the table under thermal
    production and hydroelectric power net of pumping plant production

             operating the highvoltage grid
             maintaining infrastructure
             planning grid development
             constructing the grid

the management of electricity transmission is divided into the activities listed below




 grid operation              the dispatching activity is performed by the national dispatching
 and dispatching             department at terna rete italia and entails ensuring the balance between
                             input and output at all times ie between the supply and consumption
                             of energy the complexity of this activity has increased over time also
                             due to the major development of renewable sources which has made
                             greater flexibility in managing dispatching resources necessary particularly
                             in situations where the supply of renewables is very high and the need
                             for energy low preparation for realtime operation includes planning
                             unavailability of the grid and of production plants with different time
                             horizons forecasting national electricity demand comparing demand for
                             consistency with the production plan determined as the result of the free
                             energy market electricity market and contracts outside of the electricity
                             market acquisition of resources for dispatching and checks on the power
                             transits for all the grid lines
                             during the realtime control stage the national control centre which
                             coordinates other centres around the country monitors the system and
                             dispatches electricity intervening by communicating commands to
                             producers and remotecontrol centres in order to vary grid supply and
                             distribution to avoid the risk of grid degeneration and prolonged power
                             outages it may also intervene in an emergency to reduce the demand
                             terna also manages the dispatching services market dsm through which
                             it acquires resources for the dispatching services for details please see

 terna  rfi agreement to develop renewable energy projects

   in november terna and rete ferroviaria italiana signed a letter of intent with the aim of working
   together to identify and carry out initiatives of shared interest relative to renewables in italy in
   particular the agreement foresees the development of a joint project to create photovoltaic plants
   that will power rfis electricity consumption with clean energy
   based on the agreement areas will be identified on which photovoltaic plants can be constructed for
   up to a maximum of 200 mw this will guarantee rete ferroviaria italiana clean energy production
   of up to 300 gwh per year
   the project being examined by terna and rfi could be the first large operation in the photovoltaic
   energy sector in italy to be carried out in a situation of grid parity meaning with no government
   incentives and in contrast with the past without additional charges falling to households and
   businesses




strategic plan

on 20 february 2017 terna approved the strategic plan for the 20172021 period which provides for
acceleration of investments on the ntg national transmission grid to facilitate the energy transition in
progress in particular the reference scenario of the electrical sector in italy and in europe characterised
by the continual growth of nonprogrammable renewable production sources and at the same time by
the gradual decommissioning of traditional generation plants makes appropriate development of the
electricity grids necessary this has led to undertaking strategic initiatives aimed at

      encouraging the integration of renewable sources and improving the security of the system
      expanding interconnections to reduce local congestions
      using cuttingedge technologies with everincreasing attention to environmental and sustainability
       aspects

in addition the 20172021 strategic plan includes consolidation in nonregulated activities of an industrial
approach positioning terna increasingly as an energy solution provider and an international strategy that
goes to support growth and value creation over the long term
maintaining a solid capital structure thanks to robust cash generation will contribute finally to sustaining
an attractive dividend policy

sustainability innovation risk management and integrity

this section covers some aspects concerned with conducting the business of terna distinguished by a
transversal approach that affects and influences all group activities it regards sustainability the subject
of this entire report yet in this instance some more significant themes and values are discussed as
well as innovation which has become a driver for business development in recent years and in 2016
especially and also regards the application of the best and most advanced technology for transmission
grid management risk management and integrity which is particularly significant in preventing corruption
the section concludes with reference to two focus areas  human rights and supply chain sustainability
 which distinguish ternas approach to stakeholder relations in general and to suppliers in particular




ternas sustainability values and themes

ternas main business is the provision of a service which is indispensable for the operation of the entire
italian electricity system and to ensure electricity for everyone commitment to this service is therefore
also our main reference point even when approaching sustainability matters this has been confirmed by
the results of the materiality analysis which was revised in 2016 and is described in the methodological
note on page 170
this analysis revealed relevant aspects including

      alignment of corporate governance with best practices
      careful risk management respect for economic  financial objectives and operating performance
       continuity quality transmission service costs
      good stakeholder management especially concerning local stakeholders
      integrity in conducting business
      issues related to the environment visual impact on the landscape in particular
      issues relative to human resources such as the development of personnel and worker health and
       safety

the relevance of the aforementioned issues is a result of their correlation with ternas capacity to create
value in the mediumtolong term
the construction and development of relationships of trust with stakeholders useful in creating value
for the company and for the stakeholders is a fundamental theme of sustainability in terna enshrined in
its code of ethics this leads to concern upstream of the possible environmental and social impacts of
ternas activities and advocates taking all necessary measures to prevent and minimise such impacts
for terna respect for the environment and for local communities is a rule of conduct which can trigger a
virtuous cycle it allows biodiversity and the richness of the landscape and local culture to be preserved
and facilitates acceptance and creation of new infrastructure generating financial benefits for shareholders
and for society which can enjoy a more secure more efficient and less costly service focus on the
community is also demonstrated by the creation of initiatives of social humanitarian and cultural value
which serve as a concrete sign of participation in the growth of civil society
for stakeholders investment in this attention translates into the social and relational capital growth
necessary for the sustainability of the terna business model more generally investment in intangible
capital is another central theme in ternas sustainability approach and is also critical to its ability to create
value in the long run in particular the role of human capital is important to terna
renewing specific technical skills of human resources which are often rare or unique in the electricity
industry constitutes an important part of ternas sustainability approach another element which is just
as important is occupational safety this is especially relevant due to the fact that many operational tasks
are associated with particular risks such as work high above ground and maintenance work on live lines

     46   2016 sustainability report




          ternas sustainability policies and management systems make reference to the code of ethics4 approved
          by the board of directors on 21 december 2006 which requires the company to provide evidence in the
          sustainability report each year of the implementation of sustainability policies and the objectives and
          results achieved
g4hr4    the reference in the code of ethics to the principles of global compact the united nations multistakeholder
          network was substantiated in 2009 with ternas formal adherence which thereby further strengthened its
g4hr5    commitment to the ten principles on human rights labour the environment and the prevention of corruption
          in recent years the transition towards a decarbonised economy has become a reference of increasing
g4hr6    importance both in terms of ternas sustainability policies and initiatives and its strategic orientation
          the international decisions of the cop 21 in paris and the subsequent cop 22 in marrakesh combined
          with european directives and guidelines have led to even greater focus on renewable sources in ternas
          programmes
          these programmes only partly concern controlling its greenhouse gas emissions while business
          opportunities are of much greater significance grid development investments meet a need to aid energy
          transition by strengthening transmission capacity and interconnections with foreign countries and
          research and innovation are also focused on identifying sustainable smart solutions that can be proposed
          to nonregulated activity customers
          other community guidelines such as those related to the development of a circular economy may offer
          opportunities if they are transformed into operational methods that are recognised by the regulator
          both the strategic plan see page 43 the grid development plan page 105 and the innovation plan see
          page 117 consider decarbonisation and the integration of renewable sources as essential inputs

     innovation

     the great changes that are occurring in the sector are redesigning electricity networks and require
     significant technological upgrades to support environmental policies and increase the efficiency of
     the system as a whole with a view to addressing the challenge of innovation terna created within
     its new strategy and development division a structure that focuses on researching sustainable and
     innovative solutions for the energy market in the fiveyear innovation research and development plan
     environmental sustainability is a fundamental driver for

             reducing the impact of company assets on the environment and measuring ternas environmental
              footprint by conducting analysis for example life cycle assessment on cables and conductors
              and assessing alternative tools for example product environmental declarations and ecolabels
              capitalising on the results in terms of social legitimacy and experience that can be used to develop
              new business
             consolidating the grid to support the move to greater use of renewables and more efficient and
              rational consumption
             anticipate and correct the impact of climate changes on grid assets so as to its best future
              developments

     risk management

     over the last decade terna has developed an interpretation and adaptation of risk management theory
     inspired by international best practice to represent describe and analyse risk scenarios that could damage
     or threaten the attainment of company objectives recognising the risk measuring it and above all studying
     the appropriate sustainable actions for containing it in the various forms in which it can arise for critical
     infrastructure of national and european importance such as that managed by terna are group priorities
     the monitoring and effective treatment of corporate risks have been implemented through the adoption
     of general organisational measures and specific safeguards
     from an organisational perspective for some time now the group has been structured in such a way so
     as to guarantee the widespread management and monitoring of activities and their related risks as well
     as a clear assignment of roles and responsibilities
     the terna board of directors appoints the head of the internal audit department who is responsible for
     checking that the internal audit and risk management system iarms is functional operational and
     adequate the audit and risk corporate governance and sustainability committee is present within
     the bod which supports top management in making evaluations and decisions concerning iarms this
     committee gives its opinion on the chief risk officer cro appointment by the director in charge of the
     iarms the cro whose duties and responsibilities are governed by a specific company policy supports
     top management in the effective management of the risk management process at a group level draws
     up policies for the analysis management and control of all business risks and coordinates all subjects
     involved in iarms in order to maximise their efficiency and reduce any overlapping of activities
     in line with this arrangement the risk management department of the security and services division
     is tasked with implementing the risk management policies and guidelines drawn up by the cro and
     pursues the goal of continuous improvement and value creation to this end it adopts the enterprise
     risk management erm approach suitably tailored to terna which integrates and systematises risk
     management with structural tools and prevention measures and makes use of a governance risk and
     compliance it tool egrc which provides an integrated view of risk management results for more
     details on the managed risks and related safeguards please refer to the integrated report

                                                                                             terna company profile   49



the risk analysis conducted by terna showed that the group is exposed not to common price and market
related risks or is so only to a limited extent in regard to nonregulated activities but to a regulatory
and legislative risk this is also due to the fact that electricity transmission is the core business of terna
which is regulated primarily through government concession and by the provisions established by the
regulatory authority for electricity gas and water aeegsi which include the definition of remuneration
of the terna service and of the corresponding tariff system
the regulatory risk derives from potential changes in the parameters used to determine regulated revenue
in 2016 amounting to around 900 of total group revenue particularly following the multiyear review of
the regulatory framework as occurred last year the normative risk is related to possible changes in italian
and european tax laws as well as those related to environmental themes in relation to environmental
energy and social work and contract matters
risk analysis not only places particular attention on shortterm risks but also emerging medium
longterm risks assessing the impact of the electricity system on climate change is an issue that is
addressed by operational risk management but which also affects the companys strategic risks to
this end terna participates together with other energy infrastructure operators in recognising and
analysing the governance methods of the risks associated with climate change run by the fondazione
eni enrico mattei in order to share strategies and processes and establish possible synergies between
companies furthermore in recent years there has been a growing opposition to the construction of
terna infrastructures which at times actually threatens the attainment of strategic andor regulatory
objectives in order to counter this phenomenon on the one hand a permanent safeguarding body the
risk observatory was created to monitor critical environmental political and social issues on the other
meetings with local communities and authorities were established which aim to define shared design
solutions and gain agreement to works from stakeholders within the local community
finally terna constantly monitors risks associated with aspects of sustainability which may have a
negative impact on its reputation and its intangible value including through ratings analyses by the main
agencies which periodically conduct sustainability assessments such as robecosam vigeo and eiris




integrity respecting the law and preventing corruption                                                               g4so8

legality and honesty are two of the general principles on which the code of ethics and the conduct of the
companys business are based


penalties
respect for norms is the foundation on which any voluntary improvement initiative must be based
the management policies and systems that terna uses to ensure compliance with norms and rules are
described in this report with reference to the various issues in question in this paragraph we focus on
summary indicators represented by administrative or judicial sanction or significant penalty proceedings
to which terna has been subjected considering the structure of the indications contained in the grig4
guidelines compliance with the law by terna is illustrated by the following points

      no significant definitive administrative or judicial proceedings were recorded in 2016 or in the two           g4en29
       years prior that imposed on terna fines or obligations to donot do eg prohibitions or that
       criminally convicted its employees
      in particular the accounting records show that no fines exceeding  10000 regarding the                      g4pr9
       environment were received in 2016
      there are no pending judicial proceedings against terna related to bribery antitrust monopolistic           g4so5
       practices nor were there any sentences condemning terna in relation to the same issues in 2016
                                                                                                                      g4so7
       or the previous two years
      there are no pending criminal proceedings for injuries caused to third parties by ternas assets

     50   2016 sustainability report




                  no injuries were suffered by employees of contractors during work entrusted by terna to the latter
                   which gave rise to definitive judicial proceedings sentencing terna to compensate for damages or
                   resulting in criminal convictions of ternas employees
                  no fines relative to cases of harassment or occupational injuries for employees or former employees
                   were applied in 2016 or the previous two years for which definitive responsibility was assigned to
                   terna



          preventing corruption
          ternas strategy in this regard focuses on three major areas organisational model 231 fraud management
          and staff training
          the safeguards and systems in the company have enabled the attribution since 2013 of legality ratings to
          the parent company with maximum points awarded by the italian competition authority ica
g4so5    in 2016 there was no pending litigation nor were any penal cases concluded in regards to corruption
          since 2014 terna has been associated with transparency international the largest worldwide organisation
          concerned with preventing and combating corruption see also page 54 and page 82
          as part of the initiatives promoted by the association in early 2016 the terna group joined the business
          integrity forum bif together with 11 other major italian companies already active on issues of integrity
          and transparency and committed to supporting the fight against corruption in business practices by
          collaborating with the network on joint projects of cultural dissemination communication and the adoption
          of counteraction tools
          in october 2016 terna renewed open transparent works the web space launched the previous year
          see ternas open transparent works online 2015 sustainability report page 35 making it accessible
          on any device currently the site contains over 10000 pieces of information concerning 176 open works
          and the 353 companies that are working on them in january 2017 terna became the first italian business
          to obtain the 37001 certification for its anticorruption management system which covers the parent
          company and all subsidiaries see the box bellow



            anticorruption the terna group the first in italy to obtain the iso
            37001 certification

             the terna group is the first in italy to certify its anticorruption management system in accordance
             with the new international regulation iso 370012016  antibribery management systems published
             in october 2015 by iso the international standard organisation to support organisations to fight
             corruption and promote ethics in their economic activities
g4so3       the requirements of safety quality social responsibility and sustainability were verified by the imq
             certifying body the most important italian organisation for auditing and assessing the conformity
             and certification of products and company management and quality systems
             the terna anticorruption management model guarantees behaviour based on principles of
             fairness transparency and integrity and is an additional element in the strategic integrated security
             project based on the implementation and synergic management of tools such as risksharing with
             institutional partners and the police the creation of transparent communication tools the promotion
             of respect for the law and prevention on crucial issues such as corruption undeclared employment
             unpaid contributions and the risk of criminal infiltration into the economic fabric procurement and
             subcontracts

                                                                                         terna company profile   51



organisational model 231
in 2002 ternas board of directors resolved to adopt an organisational and management model which
met the requirements of legislative decree no 231 of 8 june 2001 in order to ensure correctness and
transparency in carrying out company business and activities in order to protect its position and image
and the expectations of its stakeholders
the current model is divided into 11 parts 1 general and 10 special which cover a series of topics in
addition to the original one on corruption prevention as well as the compliance regulation the task of
keeping the model up to date is assigned to the project coordination and model 231 monitoring unit
within the corporate affairs division
numerous training initiatives were carried out in 2016 which are covered in the employee awareness
section further information on ternas organisational model and those of the groups other companies is
available in the investor relations section under corporate governance on ternas homepage http
wwwternait



fraud management
in its focus on corporate fraud terna adopts a constituent element of its approach to business management
an effective approach against fraud has three primary goals prevention detection and reaction
terna has sought to protect its reputation and image by adopting a fraud management structure in
order to ensure that corporate assets tangible and intangible resources direct and upstream benefits
are protected with regard to all illegal events that could compromise them through activity aimed at
preventing and managing corporate fraud
in order to identify potential internal vulnerabilities and then act to remove them terna has developed a
reference methodological model based on the systematic analysis of preconditions that can be associated
with fraudulent events identifying critical areas in which fraudulent phenomena are more likely and
tracing the triggers back to any organisational and operational problems in the processes
this is accompanied by a constant monitoring of its internal regulations and their application in order to
assess and enhance the efficacy of the internal audit and risk management system with regard to fraud



employee awareness                                                                                                g4so4
all new employees attend training courses which aim in part to ensure awareness and dissemination of
the rules on conduct and procedures established to prevent crime at all levels of the company within their
objectives these courses also train and inform personnel about the areas at risk of criminal activity and        g4hr2
about potential crime in relation to the work carried out
a structured and multiyear training plan was drafted in 2016 on the issues regarding organisational
model 231 and combating corruption
part of the plan has been carried out specifically a classroombased course that involved 40 employees
of the tamini group and two editions of a workshop on combating corruption transparency and market
abuse which involved around 120 employees an online training programme was also initiated at the end
of 2016 on organisational model 231
for the twoyear period 20172018 the plan envisages classroombased courses aimed at specific target
audiences which will involve senior managers junior executives whitecollar workers and a selection of
bluecollar workers

g4hr1    respect for human rights
g4hr3
          the terna group operates in italy where the legal framework and the level of civil development largely
g4hr5    guarantee respect for human rights freedom of association and collective bargaining thus making it
          noncritical for a company to take particular action on these issues with the implementation of specific
g4hr8    management policies
          since december 2009 terna has been part of the global compact adopting its principles as a formal
g4hr9
          point of reference after already having cited them since 2006 in its code of ethics in 2014 and 2016 the
          audit unit carried out two surveys to gauge the employees perception on the application of human rights
          within the company and towards suppliers the survey investigated observance of the principles of the
          global compact by the group companies following the indications of the united nations ruggie report
          in regard to human rights see also page 52 of the 2014 sustainability report
          notwithstanding the above terna has set itself the objective of verifying the lack of any critical issues
          through systematic due diligence that on the one hand takes all company activities as its reference point
          and the stakeholders with rights on the other with particular regard to the most vulnerable groups in line
          with the guidelines of the united nations ruggie report
          the managerial responsibility for human rights rests above all with the human resource and organisation
          procurement and contracts and security and services departments for guaranteeing respect for
          human rights and workers protection in contracted and subcontracted activities see the supply chain
          sustainability section on page 53 and the audit unit for ensuring that ternas code of ethics is correctly
          applied the corporate social responsibility unit finally tracks changes in external references eg
          international conventions



            terna the best italian company in terms of human rights

             in february 2017 the french ratings and sustainability research agency vigeoeiris released the
             results of its new research on the actions of corporations relative to human rights
             in the human rights responsibilities of business in a changing world study conducted on over
             3000 companies in 35 countries and across 38 sectors terna ranked 14th overall the top italian
             company within the group of the best 30 worldwide
             vigeoeiris considered how companies integrated respect for human rights into their policies
             operating practices and the transparency of communications outlining results achieved assessment
             of these aspects provides a snapshot of the extent to which companies have effectively implemented
             the indications in the un guiding principles of business and human rights applying the three
             basic items indicated in the guidelines to human rights management protect respect remedy terna

the predominance of national and local suppliers is a consequence of the specific nature of the business
and in particular of the need to perform fast maintenance work on plants to ensure the utmost security
of the electrical system suppliers located in geographical proximity to the plants also guarantee more
competitive transport costs for heavy and bulky supplies contributing in this way also to reducing the
related environmental impact
with a view to expanding the supplier portfolio the market is continuously scouted this implies rigorous
meetings with both italian and overseas potential suppliers
in the various stages of the procurement cycle terna analyses the suppliers characteristics as regards
legality technical and organisational capacity and environmental sustainability and social responsibility
issues as far as the latter are concerned monitoring to guarantee correctness is based on various tools
which create more stringent conditions when the product categories are more significant for terna or
owing to the potential social and environmental impact of the suppliers businesses
all suppliers are required to commit contractually to behave in compliance with the provisions of ternas
code of ethics and model 231 sanctions are imposed for any misconduct although a preponderant
proportion of suppliers are italian in the other cases the supplier is always subject to screening in relation
to country of origin in cases of countries at risk as regards respect for human rights or corruption specific
further investigations are carried out
for procurement that regards the performance of activities linked to ternas core business instrumental
contracts and which mainly comprise supplies of electrical materials and equipment work contracts and
services in the sectors of electricity transmission telecommunications and information technology the
legal regulations provided for in the contracts code apply numerous requirements for contractualisation
involve environmental and social aspects human rights working conditions among these for example
checks on regular payment of contributions no breaches of workplace safety laws and no environmental
crimes the integrity pact validated in its most recent form in 2014 by transparency international entails
commitments in relation to integrity and combating corruption finally for certain sectors specific social
and environmental requirements are introduced at the qualification stage

 the new public contracts code comes into force

   in april 2016 the italian government by way of implementation of european directive 232425 of 2014
   declared the new public contracts code that introduced important changes related to sustainability
   and the environment
   in december 2016 terna in accordance with the new principles provided for by the code issued its
   new regulation on procurement which is valid for the whole group
   specifically sustainability elements were introduced such as qualitative measurement parameters in
   tender drafting according to the criteria of the most economically advantageous offer applying them to
   both economic operators and the supplies offered the following in particular were added

         sustainability requirements for example functional and aesthetic aspects
         accessibility for people with disabilities
         certifications on the health and safety of workers oshas 18001
         social and environmental features
         reduction of energy consumption and environmental resources used in the work or product
         possession of a european union environmental quality brand eu ecolabel related to the
          goods or services covered by the contract in an amount equal or greater than 30 of the
          supply or services value of the same contract
         offsetting of greenhouse gas emissions related to the companys activities calculated in
          accordance with the methods established based on recommendation no 2013179eu of the
          commission dated 9 april 2013 concerning the use of common methodologies to measure
          and communicate environmental performance throughout the life cycle of products and
          organisations

   for tenders based solely on price the economic value of the tender must also consider economic
   components related to use and maintenance costs taking into consideration energy and natural
   resource consumption polluting emissions and external costs for mitigating the costs of climate
   change referring to the entire life cycle of the work good or service with the strategic objective of
   a more efficient utilisation of resources and circular economy that promotes the environment and
   employment
   lastly terna has created a training module for all the groups buyers more than 50 people aimed
   at presenting all the changes introduced by the new code and highlighting those that deal with
   sustainability




assessment of esg criteria in qualifying suppliers
most of the product categories that are most significant for the core business from a technical and
economic point of view are subject to qualification only companies with the requisites of legislative
compliance in line with that of the contracts code and of technical and organisational quality and financial
solidity are admitted to the relevant register
in areas at greater risk from the point of view of sustainability an adequate level of environmental
management and the ability to protect worker health and safety are also required they are both
represented by documented corporate procedures that outline the significant elements in accordance
with the uni en iso 14001 and bs ohsas 18001 international standards
of all the qualified suppliers 80 have acquired or are acquiring bs ohsas 180012007 safety
certification and 81 possess or are acquiring iso 140012004 environmental certification

g4hr4       assessing esg risks in foreign supplies
g4hr5       within the context of procurement activities country risk is understood as the possibility of suffering
             damage on the occurrence of circumstances or events which can be linked to the economic social
g4hr6
             and political context of the country in which the supplier normally operates it is a much lower risk than
             that associated with environmental and health and safety matters and is currently negligible given the
             prevalence of domestic suppliers but it could assume greater significance as the procurement markets
             expand and more generally because of ternas foreign expansion strategy to analyse and assess the
             most significant risk factors which relate to the macroareas of economic and political governance of the
             various countries and to observance of the human rights established at the international level objective
             elements are used including ratification of the un and ilo conventions combined with the assessments
             expressed by the main international nongovernmental organisations and by the most important ratings
             agencies working in the fields in question these assessments are updated regularly and therefore
             constitute a source of constant monitoring of the effective evolution of the situation these assessments
             are combined with reporting of the restrictive measures issued by the italian and european authorities
             which entail limitations on the free circulation of goods trade embargoes or rules of conduct in the case
             of transactions with countries offering tax advantages tax havens



             monitoring of safety the environment and human rights at contractors sites
             the increase in workers employed by contractors and subcontractors in 2016 is linked to the increase in

             1 the data take into account the term of construction contracts and the variations in the workforce required and relate to various types
                 of terna work contracts from large construction sites to cutting vegetation under power lines the days worked and the fte units are
                 estimated on the basis of the average daily presences at the largest construction sites and the amounts paid for contracted work on smaller
                 sites no further information is available on the types of contracts used by contractors


             considering the significant use of external labour on ternas construction sites work contracts are
             subject to stricter rules regarding not only qualification but also management particularly with reference
             to occupational safety the costs of eliminating or limiting the risks of interference are excluded from the
             downward price competition for awarding the contract

                                                                                           terna company profile   57



during the qualification process terna requires that documented procedures for protecting the health and
safety of workers be presented for companies in categories considered most significant with regard to
safety and the environment an indepth investigation of the management practices adopted is envisaged
by means of a detailed questionnaire
for contractor employees terna requires additional certifications                                                      eu18

      that they understand italian
      that all workers on overhead power line construction sites mainly bluecollar have examined
       and have been appropriately instructed on the use of personal protective equipment the risks
       established in the constructionsite safety plan csp and the operating safety plan osp
       prepared by terna and the environmentalprotection measures as established in the relevant
       operating procedure management of the environmental aspects during plant construction which
       is attached to each contract
      attendance at training courses lasting between 24 and 32 hours for several specific roles eg
       workers installing and maintaining overhead lines workers cutting vegetation site foremen team
       leaders and safety managers
      appointment of a safety prevention and protection manager rspp a constructionsite safety
       representative a crisis manager and substitute and an assigned doctor
      a request in contracts drawn up with contractors to provide injury rates for the year

the actual training of personnel is verified through a web platform  the qualified company personnel
project
to reduce to a minimum the risk of violations of human and labour rights to the detriment of contractor
employees in addition to the specific instrumentalcontract documentation terna also requires a copy
of an insurance policy covering damages to third parties personal injuries and damage to property
including the contractors for the entire duration of the work and in an amount appropriate to the type of
work performed as well as a periodical copy of the payment of socialsecurity and other contributions



activities in 2016
in line with previous years in 2016 17 construction sites for building lines and substations entrusted to
contractors were checked across the country with additional controls beyond those required by law the
construction sites were chosen on the basis of the duration of the work and the complexity of the activities
to be undertaken during the inspections not only aspects closely associated with workplace safety were
analysed but also those associated with environmental protection such as water and waste management
and interference with the surrounding environment
in regards to integrated environmentalsafety security and the continuous safety improvement plan the
near miss safety and environment project continued to be extended with the aim of identifying and
analysing all unusual events near misses and environmental accidents that occurred during working
activities and that although they had the potential to do so did not harm people or the environment
in 2016 the activities of the intercompany environmental health and safety forum continued in
which the leading italian operators of network plants and infrastructure take part the aim is to facilitate
discussions identify the best safety practices discuss interpretations of laws and create a virtuous
path of continuous improvement on the subjects of health safety and the environment in particular two
technical workshops on worker management abroad and site safety were organised
lastly terna contributed to the dissemination  through the supplier portal on the website wwwternait
 of a few governance tools code of ethics whistle blowing and the integrity pact amongst small and
mediumsized suppliers which they may choose to adopt the project offers the option of downloading
a governance kit for free from the websites of the member companies
it the kit is used the companies must only provide proof on their websites and promote the training of their
employees and the information to their suppliers

58   2016 sustainability report




     this is a cultural initiative that promotes and disseminates integrity and anticorruption tools whereby a
     few large companies including terna provide their small suppliers with certain preset policies without
     requiring their mandatory use but rather as an ideal sharing of best practice



     equal opportunities and transparency in contractual relationships
     access to tender procedures is guaranteed for all suitable companies according to the principle of
     equal opportunities and is governed by the regulation on procurement the regulation represents the
     corporate reference document for ternas procurement activity and was prepared on the basis of the
     contracts code legislative decree 502016 which in turn transposes the eu legislation on the subject
     another essential tool for guaranteeing transparency in procurement is the procurement portal the
     section of the institutional website based on criteria of simplicity effectiveness and efficiency through
     which it is possible to find out about competitive tenders and take part in online tenders as well as to
     complete the qualification procedure for access to the register moving towards paperless management
     in 2016 approximately 1300 requests for online assistance were received from suppliers all of which
     were resolved in the times provided for in the corporate procedures

         terna plus in previous years the amount of atypical contracts was within the mandatory category




     continual improvement and auditing tools
     a supplier list was created in 2016 an integrated system of data collection and screening of information
     on selected suppliers within market areas not subject to qualification aimed at defining lists of questions
     to be used to identify competitors in procedures to award work for contracts below european significance
     thresholds
     the new application is an important development in our relationship with suppliers the integration
     with the tender platform allows for simplification transparency and interactivity aspects to be further
     developed and alongside the qualification portal  on which the selection process for core compartments
     takes place  it helps to guarantee greater monitoring of suppliers
     dialogue with suppliers remains the most important tool to guide their growth from the point of view of
     ethics environmental sustainability and social responsibility
     in regards to qualified suppliers the existence of the suppliers esg requisites is verified over the three
     years for which the qualification is valid through constant checks which during 2016 translated into 743
     audits if conduct is found to no longer be in line with the qualification requirements the supplier may be
     warned or suspended temporarily from the register and in the most serious cases removed altogether

                                                                                            terna company profile   59

     relations with stakeholders


     relational capital our approach

     a relationship of mutual trust between terna and its stakeholders is essential in order to achieve the
     groups strategic objectives the relevant criteria and means to achieve this are described in the specific
     stakeholders management model guideline which was drafted in 2015 and is in line with the aa1000
     stakeholder engagement standard ses developed by accountability7
     the model consists of a few basic parts that are regularly updated

             stakeholder map
             the ranking of importance of stakeholders which reflects the dependence and influence each of
              them hold with terna
             the matrix of optimal relationship procedures that guides ternas approach to stakeholder
              engagement
             the monitoring system that specifically implements engagement activities and allows for
              stakeholders opinions and expectations and their degree of satisfaction in relation to terna to be
              canvassed

     each year a specific engagement programme identifies the actions to be carried out both in terms
     of bringing actual relationship procedures in line with optimal ones and regularly listening to the most
     influential stakeholders
     the first annual monitoring was conducted in 2016 this task involved all company departments and
     included several direct stakeholder engagement initiatives such as the survey of nonregulated business
     customers
     overall the stakeholders management model is a set of tools designed to provide terna with a way of
     measuring the evolution of its relational capital in order to prevent the risk of terna not becoming aware of
     possible problems in good time and to create value through the participatory contribution of stakeholders
     the categories of stakeholders identified within the map and the main activities that distinguished their
     relationship with terna in 2016 are described below




     7 the 2011 version of the aa1000ses standard was taken into account when drafting the model because the most recent update to the
         standard was published in november 2015 when the guideline had already been adopted

                                                                 relations with stakeholders   63

electricity service operators

these are the parties that represent the various activities connected to the electricity service and with
whom terna maintains relations that are severely regulated and marked by mutual impact and influence
on many levels these stakeholders also have potential influence on regulatory authorities and public
decisionmakers
terna maintains relations with grid users and electricity industry operators through various communication
channels these relations are largely defined by the regulations that govern the processes of development
and management of the electricity grid terna has also developed additional channels such as the portals
my terna the platform through which terna manages contracted dispatching users with an associated
dedicated call centre and gaudì
in addition to the information below please see the section on regulators of licensed activities which
deals with the public consultation process on the development plan managed by the aeegsi that takes
the form of an engagement activity between terna and sector operators



consultation committee
the committee is a technical body chaired by a terna representative that constitutes the permanent base
for consultation with companies involved in the electricity industry and includes representatives from the
various user categories namely distributors producers from both conventional and renewable sources
large industrial customers wholesalers and consumers the regulatory authority for electricity gas and
water and the ministry of economic development participate as observers
the committee has an advisory role regarding the general criteria for the development of the grid and
interconnections and amendments and additions to the grid code that become necessary based on
operational experience acquired or following on from changes to the legal or regulatory framework
the committee may also advocate changes to current rules and may play a conciliatory role to facilitate
the resolution of any disputes resulting from the application of the rules of the grid code
in 2016 the committee was involved in the consultation process for the update and revision of the grid
code with regard to rules for dispatching the unavailability protocol and the procedure for the connection
of plants to the ntg
the committee was also provided with precise information concerning the progress of the activities
referred to in previous development plans and the possible development of system scenarios and lines
for developing the 2017 development plan in 2016 the consultation committee met twice

     the gaudì portal
     gaudì is the unique plants data management system for the electricity generated by terna at a national
     level pursuant to the resolution of the aeegsi argelt 12410 in order to streamline the flow of information
     and simplify the processes that affect companies in the electricity generation sector
     all production plants within italy are identified within gaudì no matter their size or fuel source conventional
     renewable cogeneration etc
     the system uses a unique code at national level to identify the production plants and individual units
     contained therein in order to facilitate the alignment of databases managed by institutional and systemic
     organisations within the sector aeegsi terna gse distributors and provide feedback concerning the
     stored data the gaudì also monitors the plant qualification process in the market the development
     stage of each production plant can be followed from the authorisation phase to connection to the grid
     and when it comes into commercial operation
     for regulatory reasons the functions of gaudì have been extended over time and consequently new
     modules have been developed on the platform the gedi distributed generation and the sspc simple
     production and consumption services the single form for managing the simplified connection process
     and new functions that not only allow for plants to be activated but for all the operations related to the
     entire lifecycle of the plant to be managed
     specifically during 2016 functions were developed that allow the transfer and application of connection
     requests and the decommissioning and conservation of plants to be managed via gaudì

relations with consumer associations
it continued its efforts to build and manage local consensus through the terna information campaign
 consumer associations project with codici lega consumatori unc mdc assoutenti adoc and
movimento consumatori the campaign aims to achieve maximum informationsharing with the localities
affected by the implementation of planned infrastructure in order to increase awareness of the usefulness
and benefits of the new infrastructure the project was implemented by focusing on the activities in the
campania region for the montecorvinobenevento work with onetoone meetings and courses with key
stakeholders one of the latest proposals included creating a campania region observatory to implement
the supply of information and company responses to a particular work with activities that are increasingly
attentive to dialogue needs



economic relations with electricity service operators
terna in providing the various public services entrusted to it under concession comes into contact with
different categories of entity that may be summarised thus

      dispatching users ie parties manufacturers wholesalers or customers to whom terna supplies
       dispatching services
      manufacturers and customers to whom terna supplies the ntg connection service
      distribution companies in close proximity to the transmission grid to whom terna delivers energy
       needed to meet customer demand

terna has economic relations also with a further category of entity represented by interruptible customers
ie customers willing to undergo sudden suspension of electricity supply of their plants
via the dispatching service terna guarantees that dispatching service users have access and use of the
national electricity system also performing all the activities necessary at any time to ensure a balance
between the consumption and production of electricity to do this terna buys resources on a market in
which it is the only operator the socalled dispatching services market msd
on this market terna buys and sells electricity and other essential services such as the reserve with the
purpose of ensuring a momentbymoment balance of the system in 2016 the economic items related to
the msd amounted to about  17 billion
terna also has the task of attributing to each dispatching service user the costs that the latter has
generated for the system due to the imbalances caused ie the difference between how much the user
programmed and how much they imputtedwithdrew from the grid such differences between the final
programmes of operators both producers and consumers and their actual behaviour attract the invoicing
of imbalance charges
most of the interactions with electricity operators are managed through the myterna portal a platform
created to optimise the commercial relationship with counterparts this portal is the main access channel
for services dedicated to operators including management of the database for requests for connection
to the ntg stipulation of withdrawal contracts management of contacts and viewing of the main data
for each operator
in 2016 terna procured resources for interruptibility and instantloadreduction services which aim to
secure the functioning of the national electricity system in the event that resources procured on the
market were found to be insufficient in 2016 there were 286 assignees of the interruptibility and instant
loadreduction service for about 3566 mw of power and the related economic liability amounted to about
 03 billion on an annual basis

           suppliers

           these are the parties whose products services and skills terna uses to support directly or indirectly the
           execution and development of its own business activity in their relationship with terna they are affected
           economically and simultaneously exert operational or strategic influence depending on their relevance
           to the supply business this category also includes the trade associations representing the interests of
           similar groups of suppliers
           in 2016 total spending to procure services supplies and labour amounted to over  529 million distributed
           among 1818 suppliers with whom contracts applied during the year
           the usual point of contact for terna and its suppliers is the procurement portal the section of the
           corporate website where it is possible to learn about tenders participate in online tenders and go through
           the qualification process for inclusion on the supplier register
           in 2014 terna adopted the electronic platform for managing contract tenders this tool ensures that the
           tender procedures are done digitally and that all the documentation produced is also digital
           the procurement department also maintains direct contact with suppliers to manage contractual
           relations and improve the companys knowledge of specific problems with groups of suppliers to that
           end meetings are periodically organised with specialist companies or industrial associations to inform
           them about any updates to the requirements or points of attention related to the ethical conduct to be
           followed in relations with terna
           terna presents and discusses its main investment projects and relative procurement plans with the
           electromechanical companies in the energy industry mostly members of confindustria anie and
           organises meetings on specific issues with particular reference to safety the important action programme
           requires an even greater effort on the part of suppliers who are required to act not merely as simple
           contractors but as real technological partners terna plays an active role in key meetings with suppliers
           such as industry meetings expos and conferences
           in order to expand its portfolio of suppliers terna continuously engages in procurement marketing
           by market scouting benchmarking and monitoring the performance of suppliers this involves constant
           meetings with both italian and overseas supplier firms
           for details on the supplier qualification and evaluation process as well as the monitoring of safety the
           environment and human rights at sites see the supply chain sustainability section on page 53

passthrough items
with regard to dispatching operations terna manages cost and revenue items connected to the
transactions completed with electricity market operators to buy and sell the energy these are the pass
through items ie those which do not influence the profitability of the terna group as revenue is equal
to cost
these items include payments such as the capacity payment which terna collects from withdrawal
dispatching users and passes on to the producers who make the capacity available on the market it also
includes the payment that terna collects from the withdrawal dispatching users and passes on to the
operators which supply the load interruption service
a significant proportion of passthrough items consists of uplift a tariff component which includes various
system costs including covering the net expenses incurred to procure resources on the dispatching
service market dsm
in 2016 passthrough revenue and costs for the terna group totalled  55985 million



2016 incentive schemes
the current regulatory framework includes bonus and penalty incentive schemes aimed at encouraging
service improvement both in terms of technical reliability and cost as is implicit in incentive mechanisms
upon reaching objectives the benefit to service users will be a multiple of the incentive paid the incentive
schemes within the regulatory framework provided for the 20162019 period can be summarised into two
types

      the transmission service quality nontariff incentive scheme
      the selective promotion of significant strategic investments tariff incentive schemes as described
       above extra wacc potential and output based incentive potential

the bonusespenalties connected to achievement of the objectives established in the incentive schemes
are included in the total regulated revenue

       terna with legambiente wwf and greenpeace for the environmental
       sustainability of the ntg

        ternas commitment to increasingly improving the environmental sustainability of the national
        transmission grid starting with its development plan has been strengthened with the signing of the
        new memorandum of understandings with legambiente wwf and greenpeace
        terna and the environmental associations will collaborate fully at the strategic level when drafting
        the national electricity grid development plan at a structural level in preparing the strategic
        environmental assessment and at an implementation level when consulting with the community to
        identify the most compatible location choices
        more specifically when drafting the terna development plan legambiente wwf and greenpeace
        will contribute to the assessment of future energy scenarios in relation to national and european
        environmental targets for the energy scenario in 2030 and 2050 in italy and europe in line with the
        agreements signed in paris in december 2015 cop21
        within the strategic environmental assessment sea the expected contribution concerns
        analysing the socioenvironmental context of areas affected by the interventions provided for in the
        development plan and identifying the environmental corridors related to the works to be carried out
        lastly in regards to the design of the works and dialogue with the community the organisations
        will cooperate in identifying the route feasibility bands for the sections of the electricity lines and
        the environmental content for consultation with local authorities so as to minimise interference
        with priority natural areas and mitigate the impact arising from development work disrupting or
        bordering on priority natural areas and implementing environmental rehabilitation measures

                                                                                          relations with stakeholders   83



local communities                                                                                                        g4so1


these include various kinds of stakeholders affected by ternas activity in the community during all stages
of the business from development to grid maintenance the identified parties include subjects that are
directly or indirectly impacted as well as subjects with the power to influence local opinionmakers
politics and decisions
ternas approach to local areas which is especially important when new lines are being constructed
consists of a voluntary process of prior engagement with local institutions regional and local administrations
park authorities etc and in the last few years the citizens of local communities directly affected by the
work this process involves the sharing of ntg development needs with local institutions a willingness
to listen to stakeholder opinions and the search for a shared solution regarding the positioning of new
infrastructure or the reorganisation of existing structures
in this way the conditions are created in which to develop and build the grid together thus making it
more sustainable and acceptable
ternas engagement with local areas envisages a voluntary preauthorisation procedure illustrated in
detail in the section on consultation on pages 84
during 2016 terna held a total of 181 meetings with local administrations involving around 270 bodies
terna has also held 7 public events described in the box below involving more than 200 citizens and has
strengthened its commitment to communication in local areas


 terna meets local citizens

   consistent with the approach it took to discussion and sharing with local areas terna developed a
   new stakeholder engagement tool for citizens drawing from a european regulation 3472013 on the
   interoperability of transeuropean energy networks terna chose to engage the citizens who live in
   the areas which are destined to be the sites of the main ntg development works
   before beginning the authorisation procedure for its works terna organises public meetings referred
   to as terna meets in order to meet the local communities and explain the need to develop the grid
   which necessitated the work explaining the implementation methods as well as alternatives that
   had been identified and above all making itself available to receive comments and clarification
   requests thus terna extended the direct engagement approach that it had already adopted with
   public administrations to individual citizens the details of the terna meets held throughout the
   year can be found in the table below

           a responsible approach to grid development consultation

g4en27    since 2002 terna has chosen to voluntarily bring discussions with local stakeholders forward to the
           project planning stage for power lines and electrical substations within its development plan to improve
           the quality of the relationship with public administrations which in this way are involved in sharing the
           electricity grid development needs and can work alongside terna to find sustainable solutions which
           accommodate those needs
           the aim of this method is the optimal localisation of new installations terna and the public authorities
           find shared solutions in terms of local corridors based on area criteria known as erpa criteria and
           ratified in specific agreements through constant discussion with local stakeholders considerations
           concerning the environment and the local area are thereby integrated into the electricity grid planning
           process
           this approach preceding involvement which would subsequently be outlined by the strategic
           environmental assessment sea subject to an ec directive 200142ec which was transposed into
           italian law only many years later in 2007 with italian legislative decree 1522006 and with much less
           detailed implications at the level of relations with local institutions further information on sea is available
           in the electric system section of the website
           in addition to dialogue with local institutions in 2015 terna increasingly made use of another mode of
           dialogue and discussion with citizens directly affected by the move to new infrastructures terna meets
           public meetings during which the company describes the requirements for developing the grid that led to
           the need for work explaining the implementation methods as well as alternatives that had been identified
           and above all gathering comments and clarification requests and providing immediate feedback




           area criteria
           agreement on location criteria is the instrument used for selecting local corridors with least impact
           these criteria are used to identify the greater or lesser degree of suitability of an area to host new electrical
           infrastructure
           terna and the regions have agreed on a system of criteria erpa based on four classes to be adopted
           when locating new electrical works

                   exclusion areas in which all construction is excluded currently the exclusion criterion includes
                    areas recognised by law as areas of absolute exclusion such as airports and military zones and
                    areas which are not directly excluded by law but which are constrained by a priori agreements
                    between terna and the entities involved
                   repulsion areas that can be considered only in the absence of more environmentally compatible
                    alternatives
                   problematic areas in which passing is problematic for an objective reason associated with
                    specific features of the area and documented by the authorities involved which therefore require
                    further analysis
                   attraction areas with good landscape compatibility and areas that already host line infrastructure
                    such as energy corridors in which it would be more sustainable to position a new line with respect
                    to new areas that do not have any line infrastructure

           the support of gis geographic information system technology is fundamental when searching for
           sustainable locations corridors for ntg development projects this technology allows comprehensive
           consideration of all information relating to the different types of land use and protection obligations
           territorial naturalistic cultural landscape etc in order identify possible locations which are the most
           compatible with the area concerned

                                                                                           relations with stakeholders   85

the construction of new power lines involves the use of between approximately 30 and 250 square meters                    g4so2
of land  usually agricultural  for each pylon
although terna is authorised by law to use an expropriation procedure italian law no 1775 of 1933 and
presidential decree 3272001 the consolidated law on expropriations to obtain land terna prefers
solutions based on mutual consent paying oneoff compensation for the right of way of the line through
private property the pursuit of a consensual solution only fails in a minority of cases making coercive
measures necessary

necessary land



management of opposition to the construction of new electricity infrastructure
terna considers respect for the environment and for the territory an integral part of grid planning and makes
every effort to act in agreement with the local citizens and institutions however new infrastructurecreation
projects often provoke adverse reactions attributable to the nimby not in my backyard syndrome in
these cases terna is willing to examine the situation and find alternative solutions including ones which
are technically more complex than those originally identified provided that they are compatible with the
general interest of the electricity service in terms of security efficiency and costeffectiveness
searching for agreed solutions requires difficult discussions and can be a drawnout process the results
are normally positive but local opposition may persist throughout please note in particular the following
cases from 2016

      rationalisation in the middle piave valley the project was authorised in february 2011 and is
       now in the environmentalimpact assessment phase some municipalities including belluno and
       soverzene were opposed to the route identified by terna in response to this opposition from local
       bodies terna proposed an alternative project in august 2015
       in 2016 dialogue continued with local bodies and the local area also due to the organisation of
       four meetings with citizens two in auronzo di cadore in november 2016 and january 2017 and
       two in cortina dampezzo in november 2016 and in january 2017
      rearrangement of the 380 and 132 kv grid in the lucca area the project was authorised in

       other obsolete plants initially coordinated with the municipalities involved the project was later
       rejected by them as a result of protests by the local population terna then prepared four alternative
       solutions and presented them to the local population during an open day held on 28 january 2016
       at nozzano castello near lucca

              the work was marked by several committees opposed to its construction which organised
              various demonstrations and events in response to these terna planned two open days the first
              in magenta the town where an electricity substation connected to the main work will be built
              in october 2015 the second in settimo milanese at the end of 2015 where terna presented

              and fai and  separately  the parco agricolo sud milano the south milan agricultural park the
              municipality of settimo and the region in order to present the possible alternative locations for the
              settimo milanese electrical substation in 2016 following on from many requests for amendments
              to the project technical meetings were held for participatory planning with the municipalities of the
              piedmont region and following on from the shared agreements with the same in december 2016

              geological surveys which were completed with the help of digos note that there is also strong
              opposition on the french side with violent demonstrations and blocking of sites occurring at
              16 december 2016 a meeting was organised in the municipality of trana with the citizens of val

              the fact that the route was fully authorised thanks in no small part to the two years of technical and
              environmental studies and intense consultation and dialogue with local communities which lead to
              over 100 meetings being held starting in 2004 from february to july 2015 the prosecutors office
              of messina sequestered pylon no 40 in the municipality of saponara for presumed breach of the
              provincial landscape protection plan which was approved after landscape authorisation for the
              work from january to march 2016 the same prosecutors office of messina sequestered pylon

              opened in november 2016 and it was only after this that objections were received from the citizens
              of the municipalities involved and a protest committee was established in december 2016 terna
              organised an open day at the municipality of oppido lucano to discuss with the local community




     the wider community

     this represents the end users of the electrical service meeting their expectations concerning the electrical
     service is an important area of commitment for terna these are the stakeholders who are impacted as
     users of the electrical service and who do not have the opportunity to influence as individuals future users
     of the service are also included within this category as they will be impacted in the longterm by ternas
     current activities
     in 2016 the research and market analysis company doxa carried out the doxa reputation italy 2016
     survey relative to the reputation of 150 brands operating in italy in the energyutilities sector terna was
     ranked second in terms of reputation the company has an extremely positive image it is first place relative

the cost of transmission on the end users bill
based on the data released by aeegsi it can be estimated tat the weight of the transmission service cost
on a typical domestic users11 electricity bill is equal to around 412
from a european commission study relative to 2015 data13 it appears that  in both the residential and
industrial segments  network costs14 sustained by italian consumers are in line with the european
average in particular in relation to only the transmission segment the italian tariffs were the lowest with
respect to some of the countries best representing the sample analysed as shown in the charts presented
below terna analysis

economic effects for the wider community                                                                                                                    g4ec8

terna ensures that a service of general interest which generates economic returns and contributes to the
countrys economic growth is provided over time
the companys grid development work is of particular importance developing interconnections
with bordering countries makes it possible to import electricity at more competitive prices compared to
domestic production as well as to have an additional power reserve and guarantee greater competition
within the energy markets reducing grid congestion improves the use of generation resources in order
to meet demand and makes it possible to use the most competitive plants with positive effects on
competition within the generation sector and on end prices
in accordance with the legal and regulatory framework all of ternas investments in grid development are
examined from a technical and economic perspective by comparing the estimated cost of the work with
the related benefits in terms of the reduction of the overall system expense in order to maximise the cost
benefit ratio consequently every euro invested by terna on average generates multiple savings for the
users of the grid which are ultimately passed on to the end consumer it is therefore significant that ternas
investment most of which is to develop the grid has increased greatly over the last few years

g4ec1    community initiatives
g4ec7    in keeping with the desire to contribute to italys civil growth beyond its infrastructural role terna again in
          2016 confirmed its support for social cultural and environmental initiatives
          ternas corporate giving work consists mainly in providing financial support to projects with social goals
          and  preferably  in organising ternas own initiatives for the benefit of the community in addition
          corporate assets which are no longer useful in the production cycle are donated and support is provided
          in the form of working time devoted to various initiatives by ternas employees in particular this includes
          paid hours used for volunteering or in social projects organised directly by terna which in 2016 included
          the next energy programme each single corporate giving request is managed in keeping with the
          groups corporate giving policy and assessed by a specific commission made up of the security and
          services external relations and csr and human resource and organisation directors
g4so6    in all cases as established by ternas code of ethics contributions are never made to political parties or
          their representatives
          as outlined in the participation in associations section above terna is a member of the london
          benchmarking group lbg and has adopted an lbg model  developing a customised variation of it  for
          defining classifying and booking company charitable initiatives the model is oriented to accounting for
          what is done by companies through initiatives that generate real external benefits such initiatives may
          involve contributions in cash gifts portion of sponsorships that translates into a real benefit membership
          of associations that promote csr in kind eg transfer of corporate property at the end of its useful
          life and working time accounting for contributions requires in some cases recourse to nonaccounting
          criteria and is therefore subject to interpretation however it also has the advantage of correlating the
          costs and benefits of the charitable initiatives in a coherent manner meaning that corporate giving can be
          strategically planned and rationally managed

                                                                                                                     relations with stakeholders   89



a significant part of the model consists in measuring the benefits inspired by measurement criteria of the
real impact on the final beneficiaries impact measurement is assigned to external parties for the most
important projects
in order to provide comprehensive information we note that in 2016 expenses accounted for as donations
and sponsorships amounted to  246100 and  921000 respectively

next energy the terna initiative for youth employability and entrepre
neurship

terna has created next energy in partnership with the fondazione cariplo an initiative that aims
to promote the development of young talent and support innovative projects for the development of
the electricity system
the strongly innovationorientated initiative is divided into two distinct pathways the first is reserved
for 15 engineering graduates preferably from the electrical engineering field and the second for 10
teams of young researchers who have a business idea to be developed
graduates were offered a paid internship lasting six months october 2016  march 2017 within the
terna departments responsible for innovation activities the fondazione cariplo in keeping with the
mission of its cariplo factory managed the incubation and acceleration experience of the selected
10 teams through its technical partner polihub  the milan polytechnic facility that focuses on start
up acceleration this also lasted six months
the two next energy pathways began at the same time in october 2016 and met regularly with
a view to sharing relative skills and experiences terna in any case guaranteed a meeting with its
technical departments to create an open innovation initiative
the selection of participants took place through two calls which could be accessed for around
two months on the dedicated website wwwnextenergyprogramit approximately 200 applications
were received and examined by two separate assessment committees which  respectively 
selected 15 graduated for the internships and 17 teams of innovators for the innovation days
that took place in late september 2016 at the end of this event the panel made up equally by
representatives from terna the fondazione cariplo and polihub chose the best 10 candidates to
begin the entrepreneurial empowerment course
for the innovator pathway the next energy call includes a second assessment by the end of
april 2017 conducted by the panel in order to award the best 3 candidates with vouchers to be spent
on services in the gotomarket totalling  50000  30000 and  20000 respectively




terna for young people the launch of the schoolwork project

the terna schoolwork project began in february 2017 at the istituto tecnico galileo galilei in
bolzano this is one of the 12 schools selected for a total of 240 students across the whole of
italy that will be involved in a training course built jointly by teachers and company experts for
professional and soft skills
this project implemented by the good school law italian law 10715 aims to encourage young
peoples transition to the world of work fostering a virtuous cycle of exchange between the company
and the external world and supporting their ability to interact at a global level through knowledge
networks
specifically the course will involve the fourth years of the schools selected and will be divided
into two modules the first the integrated course on the electricity system and green jobs
will take place thanks to the contribution of skills from terna technicians working in the area
amounting to around 50 hours of lessons from midfebruary to midmay 2017 on the electricity
system occupational safety and innovation the second module summer camp will be held in
collaboration with elis and will include a selection of students from each school the objective is
to provide indepth learning on technical issues that are also inherent to soft skills by developing
project work workshops and team work aimed also at orientating the future professional choices
of the students

       terna is to take electricity to the peruvian region of ancash

        terna is renewing its social commitment to the poorest and most inaccessible regions in the world
        and has undertaken to create a power line in peru to allow the parish of chacas and the ngo
        operazione mato grosso to significantly increase the availability of electricity in order to benefit
        development projects within local communities
        this is ternas second social initiative in south america indeed in 2011 the company completed
        a power line of approximately 37 km at an altitude of 4000 metres in kami bolivia to transport
        hydroelectric energy that was otherwise unusable
        this new initiative formalised in november 2016 with the signing of an agreement with the parish
        of chacas and the ngo operazione mato grosso provides for the creation of a working group
        made up of terna technicians and external volunteers to design and construct a 16 km power line
        between pomabamba and huari by the end of 2017 terna will see to implementing the technical
        project following on from authorisation procedures for the work to construct  also through its
        subsidiary companies that operate in the area  the infrastructure from the power station to the point
        of connection with the line and manage the maintenance for a period of 12 years starting from when
        the line effectively becomes operational




     inquiries litigation and penalties


     preliminary inquiries of the regulatory authority for electricity gas and water
     at no time in 2016 did the regulatory authority for electricity gas and water hereinafter authority begin
     any formal preliminary enquiries of potential interest for terna
     however with reference to previous years we note the factfinding enquiry in relation to interruptions
     in the electrical service that occurred on 6 february 2015 and on the following days in vast areas of the
     emiliaromagna and lombardy regions which was launched with resolution 962015eeel this enquiry
     was closed with resolution 6442015eeel through which the authority approved the final report
     and provided for certain stipulations regarding some distribution companies involved in the factfinding
     enquiry
     the authority ordered the closure of the enquiry with resolution 4132015eeel closure of the fact
     finding enquiry related to provision of the electricity measurement service which aimed to verify the
     application of the authoritys provisions concerning electricity measurement launched with resolution
     4752013eeel we also note the following procedures which are still pending

     resolution 4502013eeel of 11 october 2013  determination of electricity price trends in sicily during
     the maintenance period on the sicilymainland interconnection in october 2013
     with this provision the authority extended the factfinding investigation launched in 2012 resolution
     4012012reel on critical issues in managing the electricity system to include sardinia as well as sicily
     this has been done in order to acquire further information on management of the sicilian electrical system
     and the conduct of operators the deadline for conclusion of both investigations has been extended to 31
     march 2014 the closure measure of this factfinding enquiry has not been implemented

     resolution 2562014ecom at 6 june 2014  launch of a factfinding enquiry on investments of regulated
     companies
     with this provision the authority enabled the launch of a factfinding enquiry on regulatedbusiness
     investment intended to verify the correctness of the information disclosed to the authority and to provide

                                                                                         relations with stakeholders   93



useful elements for the evaluation of the appropriateness and consistency of investments in relation
to the industry context within the framework of this survey the authority intends to prioritise further
investigation into the information submitted to determine electricity distribution reference tariffs
with resolution 4122015eeel of 6 august 2015 the authority also extended the factfinding inquiry
on investments of regulated companies to the costs of grid plants for connection made by electricity
producers
lastly following the evidence which emerged from the factfinding enquiry a series of disciplinary
proceedings for violating disclosure obligations relating to tariff regulation of electricity distribution were
launched and the enquiry into the investments declared by certain electricity distribution companies was
concluded



environmental litigation
environmental litigation originates from the installation and operation of electricity plants and primarily
involves damages which could derive from exposure to electrical and magnetic fields generated by power
lines the parent company and the subsidiary terna rete italia srl are involved in various civil and
administrative lawsuits requesting the transfer or change in operations of allegedly harmful power lines
despite their being installed in full compliance with the applicable legislation italian law no 36 of 22
february 2001 and the prime ministers decree of 8 july 2003 only a very small number of cases include
claims for damages for harm to health caused by electromagnetic fields
only in a few cases have adverse judgements been issued against the parent company these have been
appealed and the appeals are still pending and adverse rulings are considered unlikely



litigation concerning licensed activities
given that it has been the licensee for transmission and dispatching activities since 1 november 2005 the
parent company is party to a number of cases appealing aeegsi med andor terna measures relating
to activities operated under the license only in cases in which the plaintiffs not only claim defects in the
measures but also allege that terna violated the rules established by such authorities or in cases in
which the measure had an impact on terna has the company appeared in court within the scope of this
litigation although a number of cases have seen the aeegsi resolutions struck down in the first and
or secondlevel court together with where applicable the consequent measures adopted by terna it is
felt that there is little risk of adverse outcomes for terna since the matters generally regard passthrough
items this position is supported by the information provided by the external legal counsel representing
the company in the cases involved as the licensee for transmission and dispatching activities the
measures taken by the parent company terna when applying the resolutions adopted by the authority
are sometimes the subject of challenges in appropriate circumstances the economic costs of such
challenges may be borne by the authority



other litigation
in addition a number of cases relating to urban planning and environmental issues connected with
constructing and operating certain transmission lines are pending the possible effects of any unfavourable
outcome to these cases are unpredictable and accordingly have not been considered when determining
the provisions for disputes and other contingencies
in a limited number of cases the possibility of an adverse outcome cannot be entirely ruled out the possible
consequences could in addition to the award of damages include inter alia the costs of modifying lines
and the temporary suspension of their use examination of the above legal disputes having regard for the

      94   2016 sustainability report




           information provided by the external legal consultants suggests that the likelihood of adverse outcomes is
           remote with the exception of a number of proceedings for which considering their status it is not possible
           at the moment to carry out reliable assessments of their outcome
           more details on the different categories of dispute are shown in the indicator tables on page 197

performing their own work within the company itself or in other circumstances by adopting this policy
terna is responding to the instructions given in the corporate governance code for listed companies on
the borsa italiana of the anac and the national anticorruption plan
this policy strengthens the internal control tools that terna uses to define the conduct guidelines to be
complied with when conducting its business and to set out the rules that oversee the pursuit of the same


environmental reports and complaints
in line with the iso 14001 environmental management system terna monitors and classifies complaints
received regarding significant environmental issues
any written communication from stakeholders can be presented to a group office or organisational unit
with the aim of reporting that an activity carried out by terna is causing or has caused damage it is filed
by the office and managed by the relevant operating unit
complaints received are classified on the basis of the relevant environmental aspects  defined by the
environmental analysis  using the following categories waste noise biodiversity landscape electrical
and magnetic fields lighting vegetation control and other
once again this year the majority of reports concerned electrical lines and referred to noise emitted
during operation electromagnetic field measurement requests and the cutting of vegetation along power
line corridors
terna responds as soon as possible and in any case within 30 days of receiving the request or within
60 days if the size and complexity of the request make it impossible to resolve within the first 30 days
in this case terna informs the requesting party of the extension in a timely manner indicating the reasons
behind it details of reports received and managed during the last threeyear period are published on

     electricity service


     continuity and security of the electricity service our
     approach

     ternas core business is the provision of electricity transmission and dispatching services in italy these
     services are in the general interest of society and performed on the basis of a government concession
     which assigns terna the role of national electricity transmission system operator tso
     to ensure this service terna makes use of the capital infrastructure made up of the highvoltage and very
     highvoltage national transmission grid the groups main asset
     the service performed by terna is indispensable for the operation of the entire electricity system and for
     ensuring electricity for everyone this entails a responsibility towards the entire country both in terms
     of the everyday operation of the transmission grid and in its medium and longterm operation which is
     reflected in management objectives
     these are therefore connected first and foremost to compliance with regulations and meeting the specific
     targets set by the industry regulatory authority the regulatory authority for electricity gas and water 
     aeegsi targets of particular relevance include

             service continuity measurements ternas performance in this area in recent years has been in line
              with the targets set
             griddevelopment and security goals set out in the
              1 security plan for the electricity system in order to plan the investments needed to improve
                  elements which have an impact on the security of the electricity system
              2 development plan approved every year by the ministry of economic development which
                  sets forth the construction of new electricity lines and substations necessary to ensure that
                  the countrys electricity demands are met for which the integration of a growing quantity of
                  production from nonprogrammable renewable sources has taken on particular importance
                  terna also selects development projects on the condition that the overall financial benefits to
                  the electricity system outweigh the costs

     since 2017 terna has also been called upon to draft a resilience plan which aims to identify the work
     needed to increase the transmission system capacity in order to guarantee performance for its safe
     operation even in extreme weather connected to climate change particularly where sleeves of ice form
     on the lines the first edition of the plan is currently being drafted
     terna as operator of the electricity system has the task of management of producer registers
     management of data on inputs and withdrawals for the determination of economic items and preparation
     of italian statistics in the electricity sector this entails knowledge of confidential sectoroperator data
     and especially those pertaining to electricity producers terna protects this confidential data using the
     best practices possible to avoid information in its possession being accessed or communicated to
     unauthorised third parties

                                                                                                             electricity service   99

each stage of the electricity system  generation transmission and distribution  contributes to the
result of ensuring the availability of electricity for society guaranteeing adequate quality standards and a
number of outages that remain below preset thresholds
terna monitors the continuity of the service provided through different indices some of which are defined
by the aeegsi resolution 25004 and by the terna grid code the portions of the ntg monitored are
those owned by terna spa and from 2012 also those controlled by terna rete italia srl

these indices are significant for the system as they monitor the frequency and impact of events that have
occurred on the electricity grid attributable to faults or to external factors such as meteorological events
over the fouryear observation period no significant variations were recorded testament to the good
service quality achieved
we must point out that at the moment of publication of this report the figures for the rens indicator for
the year 2016 are not available while awaiting the totals released by the aeegsi
it must be stressed finally that the rens index is relevant for the purposes of the impact on regulated
revenue in fact the aeegsi has regulated the quality of the service provided by terna using an incentive
penalty scheme set out by resolution argelt 19711 it is applicable to the 20122015 regulatory period
and relates to the regulated energy not supplied rens index referring separately to the grid owned by
terna spa and that owned by the subsidiary terna rete italia srl with effect from 2016 the service
quality supplied by terna is regulated by resolution 65315reel which applies to the 20162023
regulatory period this resolution assumes one index only the ntg rens which includes both the grid
owned by terna spa as well as the grid of the subsidiary terna rete italia srl resolution 382016r
eel recently clarified that the portion of the grid acquired from the fsi group is excluded from the bonus

the security plan for the electricity system

the security plan for the electricity system prepared annually by terna and approved by the ministry
of economic development is the fouryear programme of initiatives aimed at preventing and reducing the
consequences of a disservice on the electricity system
the initiatives aimed at the security of the electricity system involve activities linked to

      operating the grid strengthening the preventative scheduling of dispatching resources
       coordinating the management of systems interconnected with neighbouring tsos improving
       control capacity in real time arranging defence plans defining system restarting strategies after
       blackouts and improving the reliability of telecommunication infrastructure to support the defence
       of the electricity grid
      physical integrity of the grid monitoring and protecting the most critical electrical substations
       and guaranteeing the information security of the infrastructures against intrusion attempts
       unauthorised access and possible cyber attacks

the current structure of the security plan envisages eight different areas for scheduling control regulation
and protection restarting and monitoring of the electricity system and an area for the secure and optimal
management of renewable sources
these intervention areas were confirmed in the fourteenth edition of the security plan 2017 security plan
which covers all the activities carried out during 2016 and those planned for the 20172020 period in order
to guarantee the security of the electricity grid
more specifically the 2017 plan confirms the needs that emerged in previous years with particular reference to

      the installation of appropriate equipment to compensate for reactive power focused on
       managing system security especially in southern italy within the expected scenarios for the
       operation of the electricity system
      the installation of devices to guarantee the security of the electricity system in the case of
       weather events snow ice salt pollution and the adoption of technological solutions capable of
       preventing the event occurring and allowing the service to recover faster than the provisions set
       forth in resolution 56315eelr concerning resilience
      strengthening of telecommunications infrastructure in order to reach electrical substations
       with optical fibre to this end an action plan was drawn up which aims to make highperformance
       and reliable connectivity possible at ternaowned plants for services such as remote management
       remote control remote protection and monitoring
      strengthening physical security systems aimed at creating a centralised integrated platform for
       managing physical security events at the main electrical substations and supporting it systems

in 2016 investments made in relation to projects provided for in the security plan amounted to
approximately  45 million
the fourteenth edition of the security plan for the years 20172020 provides for investments of
around  330 million over the next fouryear period

      information security and cyber security

      the risks that weigh upon the advanced technologies that make up a companys cyberenvironment are
      ever greater and continuously evolving especially if functional to critical infrastructure activities as in
      the case of terna in addition to traditional threats to ict projects and those inherent to the plant setting
      natural or artificial threats the number the degree of danger and trends linked to cyberthreats have
      increased sharply originating in cyberspace and strengthened by the digitalisation process taking place
      in every organisation
      as interconnections between computers and new communication technologies are increasing the cyber
      risk is a permanent fixture among the most relevant risks that affect highlyinnovative companies
      for some time now terna has adopted an information security governance model based on a
      regulatory framework of policies and procedures combined with an operating programme coordinated
      by information risk management irm under the direction and coordination of the groups ciso chief
      information security officer which has allowed us to identify the top cyber risks the programme takes
      into account all the risk factors to which group ict ecosystem is exposed organisational technical and
      technological physicalenvironmental cyber etc including compliance with laws on data processing
      and the fight against cyber crime and its aim is to counteract their impacts interruptions to grids or it
      services critical to electricity system operation andor with potential damage to the ntg confidentiality
      loss theft or tampering with sensitive strategic and confidential information relating to the electricity
      market andor on third parties held by terna
      lastly through the security operation centre soc a structured process is implemented which aims
      to quickly identify and contain security incidents minimising information loss and working to restore any
      involved services in addition the soc has responsibility for measuring the risk to which company assets
      and the information contained in them are exposed

g4ec7     grid development

           the transmission grid must evolve consistently with developments in the generation and consumption of
           electricity which grow at uneven rates in different areas of italy and change the flows of electricity in the
           system thereby causing congestion in the existing grid
           in recent years the need to integrate a considerable proportion of nonprogrammable renewable sources
           nprs has taken on particular importance
           in response to these needs terna prepares a national transmission grid development plan hereinafter
           dp every year containing the grid development projects envisaged for the next ten years and the progress
           made on development works planned in previous years
           every dp is assessed and approved by the ministry of economic development subject to public
           consultation18 as well as by the regulatory authority for electricity gas and water and is also subjected
           to evaluation by the grid user consultation committee
           furthermore the plan is also subject to the strategic environmental assessment sea19 process carried
           out by the ministry of the environment and protection of land and sea in collaboration with the ministry
           for cultural heritage with the purpose of integrating environmental considerations into the process of
           preparing the plan thus guaranteeing environmental sustainability




           18 pursuant to article 3613 of legislative decree 9311

2017 development plan

the 2017 development plan has many new features compared to previous editions in keeping with the
evolution of the energy context which is distinguished firstly by new climate targets arising from the
signing of the paris agreements cop21 and secondly by the altered regulatory context provided for
by the regulatory authority for electricity gas and water aeegsi which revised the regulation based
on an outputbased system aimed at measuring the benefits obtained from development projects and
identifying more efficient solutions overall at a lower cost and with lower environmental impact
the 2017 dp foresees investments totalling  78 billion thanks to which efficiencies will be achieved for
the electricity system as well as benefits such as

        reduction of energy losses of approximately 830 billion kilowatthours per year
        reduction of congestions for an amount of more than 3000 mw
        greater overall foreign exchange capacity estimated at more than 5000 mw
        greater power capacity generated by renewable sources of around 4500 mw

with regard to the benefits in terms of a reduction in co2 emissions refer to the dedicated paragraph on
page 144
in 2016 the aeegsi approved new provisions on the methods of drafting the tenyear national transmission
grid development plan20 starting from that of 2017 also requiring terna to consistently update chapter 2 of
the grid code and to prepare a new annex containing the new costbenefit analysis methodology when
preparing the 2017 dp terna

        applied the requirements on the subject of completeness and transparency of information and
         costbenefit analysis methodology in order to promote the planning of investments according to
         criteria of selectivity and greater usefulness for the electricity system
        applied the minimum requisites of the costbenefit analysis methodology for all grid development
         operations with an investment cost equal to or greater than  25 million and in terms of subsequent
         plans at least for all development operations with an investment cost equal to or greater than  15
         million the new costbenefit analysis provides for an important alignment with criteria and methods
         applied in the entsoe setting introducing analysis across a greater number of scenarios as well
         as for the first time environmental and social benefit indicators
        every two years draws up its forecasts on the electricity system development scenarios over a
         period of time of not less than twenty years
        stated that it would submit a disclosure on the investment expenditure expected for each of the
         next five years to the authority by 30 april 2017 of each year

         the project also positively impacts the environment as it will lead to 700000 tonnes less co2 in the
         atmosphere and visually will free up over 200 hectares thanks to the removal of 114 km of obsolete
         lines the new 60 km of overhead lines were constructed using singlestem pylons which are much
         less invasive than the traditional truncated pyramidal pylons




      progress on construction sites
      the major works that began in 2016 and which are still in progress aim to reduce grid congestion connect
      new power plants particularly those based on renewable sources and make the national transmission
      grid more reliable with a greater emphasis on the environment and safety for details on the status of

      sources

      terna has implemented directive 200928ec and the national action plan nap prepared by the ministry
      of economic development as well as included a specific section in the development plan dedicated to
      the actions needed for full use of the energy deriving from the production of renewable source systems
      the grid analyses have enabled us to identify action to be taken both on the primary 400220kv
      transmission grid and on the 150132 kv highvoltage grid

connecting new plants

terna has an obligation to connect all potential users that request connection to the grid21 based on criteria
that allow for continuity and security in operating the grid to which the new user plant is to be added
specifically terna is responsible for connection to the national transmission grid ntg at highvoltage
and veryhighvoltage for plants with a power of 10 mw or more
the technical procedural and economic terms and conditions for supplying the ntg connection
service are regulated by provisions issued by the regulatory authority for electricity gas and water
aeegsi these resolutions are implemented in the grid code which describes the transparent and non
discriminatory rules for grid access and its technical regulations
connection requests managed by terna which correspond to more than 2000 active connection requests
amount to a capacity of over 100 gw these requests have accumulated over the years and while terna
has already implemented the actions for which it is responsible during the respective phases of the
connection process the requests have not yet been completed for various reasons eg authorisations
not yet requested or not yet obtained
the trend in connection requests has been almost constant over the last three years
in regard to plants from renewable energy sources res there are 1358 active connection requests
with a solution on the ntg for a capacity of 58381 mw
the figure below which summarises these requests by source and geographical distribution shows

        wind energy takes prime position among renewable sources on the ntg in view of the continuous
         decline in connection requests from photovoltaic sources
        there were more requests for the connection of generation plants from renewable energy in
         southern italy and the islands which are more favourable in terms of the availability of primary
         sources

       italy  france              the new italyfrance direct current interconnection between the nodes of
       interconnector              piossasco and grande ile will make the french electricity border the most
                                   important for italy significantly increasing the crossborder interconnection
                                   capacity 190 km long the power line will be the longest underground line in
                                   the world with very low impacts on the environment and the territory
                                   the laying of around 15 km of cables began in march 2016 to connect
                                   the substations of piossasco and avigliana in regard to the piossasco
                                   substation geological surveys and basic engineering studies were carried
                                   out and site preparation works were completed
                                   in july 2016 the ministry of economic development issued the decree of
                                   exemption for the private line of the interconnection power line in favour of
                                   the subsidiary piemonte savoia srl pisa the document was sent to

      intellectual capital and innovation

      the current phase of energy transition towards more sustainable solutions has a major effect in terms of
      new development opportunities including on group intellectual capital
      the consolidated activities of research and the planning of company assets also implemented by
      interacting with suppliers as well as conducting timely surveys and analysis on operational experience
      and international benchmarks have been overtaken by the need to identify optimal solutions and address
      innovation by meeting the growing environmental sustainability needs of the entire electricity system
      this new scenario is leading to a good portion of production capacity being shifted to renewable energy
      plants
      in response to this macro trend the electricity system is adopting a new management approach though
      targeted experimentation that is increasingly intelligent and flexible both at a grid level thanks to the use
      of efficient and innovative technologies smart grids storage systems as well as at the electricity market
      level with an unprecedented revolution that will bring about the integration of distributed generation
      resources storage and demand within the services market in the short term and the integration of
      national markets at a european level
      the electricity scenario will gradually have to guarantee increasing integrability and interoperability
      between the electricity grid and other networks transport gas water etc so as to make the italian
      system and the europeansystem increasingly costeffective and ecosustainable
      this development will create new opportunities for growth and business for terna which will hinge on a
      strong upgrade in intellectual capital in 2016 the group has strongly accelerated the process both from
      an organisation perspective as well as a strategic one which is covered in the paragraphs below



        codrongianos european innovation hub

         the terna technological hub was inaugurated in codrongianos ss with the italian prime minister
         in attendance a flagship centre for innovation
         the site is home to the terna storage lab the first international energy storage systems project to
         support and protect electricity grids this is a highlyinnovative experimental project created by
         terna and developed in accordance with the aeegsi to maximise the exploitation of power from
         renewable sources and to improve the robustness of the highvoltage and veryhighvoltage systems
         with around 12 tested technologies in total across all of its storage sites terna is in possession of
         the most extensive expertise concerning grid scale energy storage worldwide in codrongianos
         where 8 are being tested terna has already completed the installation and commissioning of the
         first 79 mw of storage systems as provided for by the company in its defence plan for the electricity
         grid 8 suppliers contributed to this initial project phase the italian company fiamm as well as
         samsung byd saft general electric toshiba siemens and gildemeister
         the codrongianos site also hosts ternas first two synchronous condensers which have been
         specifically designed to improve the management of renewable sources these are large machines
         320 tonnes each that are connected to the grid and allow for the stability and security of the
         electricity grid in the region to be improved the development of renewable sources  which are
         intermittent by nature and thus nonprogrammable and create power surges  is of increasing
         interest to the local electricity grid this can cause difficulty when managing them and regulating
         voltage especially within poorly connected grids that are not very extensive as is the case with
         sardinia the condensers are a viable solution for dealing with these problems their task involves
         guaranteeing greater regulation capacity and improved operational flexibility and thus increasing
         grid capability preventing power surges and simultaneously small energy losses thereby avoiding
         the occurrence of critical situations in addition to terna many european and american utility
         companies use this kind of technology to stabilise the electricity grid

                                                                                                   electricity service   117



programmes and projects for innovation

in line with the rapid evolution of the electricity scenario and the objectives contained within the strategic
plan the strategy and development department was enhanced further and in march 2016 it became
the second division within the group strategy and development division tasked with analysing the
development of the electricity system assessing impacts and opportunities for the group developing
international business and nonregulated activities within italy coordinating the groups regulated and
nonregulated activities drafting the development plan of the ntg and the security plan for the national
electricity system as well as managing relationships with domestic regulatory bodies and authorities
this new organisational division has also been assigned the task of centralising and coordinating the
innovation of the group in order to guarantee the initiatives full compliance with the strategic guidelines
of the companys strategic plan
it was on this basis that the 20172021 innovation plan was drafted with the objective of guiding and
overseeing innovation within the company through the identification of strategic guidelines project
monitoring and the management of support tools as described in the box below



 20172021 innovation plan

   the new edition of the innovation plan includes initiatives on the main research and development
   themes which focus on core activities now addressed with new perspectives and approaches and
   decidedly innovative sectors
   the initiatives are all defined within an innovation framework that is divided into six clusters
   characterised by the centralised management of the tools to promote and accelerate corporate
   innovation

      environment


      natural capital our approach

      terna recognises the importance of the right balance between energy requirements and protecting the
      environment and local communities in carrying out its business it therefore seeks appropriate solutions to
      ensure italy has the electricity it needs in the most reliable economical and environmentally sustainable way
      in terms of impacts on the planets natural capital the most significant impact of ternas work is a result
      not so much of using natural resources or of emitting pollutants but rather of soil occupation due to the
      physical presence of power lines and electrical substations and their interaction with the surrounding
      natural and urban environment
      the most significant environmental aspects of ternas work are thus

              soil occupation with the consequent visual impact of substations and lines on the landscape
              electric and magnetic fields
              the interference of lines with biodiversity with particular regard to birdlife
              greenhouse gas emissions
              special waste and its management

      terna has established an environmental policy which describes its commitment to practices which limit
      and reduce its environmental impact even beyond the limits imposed by law whenever this does not
      compromise the other general interests that it is obliged to protect among ternas main environmental
      commitments the following should be noted

              in the planning of grid development investments listening to the needs expressed by stakeholders
               in particular local institutions and environmentalist associations and seeking agreement on
               solutions through a process of voluntary prior consultation with local institutions see pages
               84 and 128
              in the construction management and maintenance of the grid adopting procedures in accordance
               where possible with reducing the environmental impact terna has adopted an iso 140012004
               certified environmental management system which covers 100 of the national transmission
               grid substations and lines and offices since 2013 the environmental management system of
               the company terna crna gora has also been iso 140012004 certified see page 47
              with regard to electromagnetic fields strict compliance with regulations and close monitoring of
               the development of scientific studies as well as a contribution to the correct presentation and
               understanding of the phenomenon see page 131
              with regard to biodiversity the commitment to limit the impact of the grid  particularly on birdlife
                with mitigation activities to be identified and finalised including programmes agreed upon with
               environmental associations see pages 83 and 132
              with regard to climate change and energy efficiency a recognition of the importance of the problem
               and a commitment to take action as far as is operationally possible to reduce the emission of
               greenhouse gases specifically ternas commitment to energy efficiency was consolidated in 2015
               with the iso 500012008 certification of its energy management system see page 145
              in relations with suppliers the requirement to gradually adapt to the environmental standards
               adopted by terna also see page 55

                                                                                                    environment   127



in organisational terms these aspects are overseen by several departments responsible for specific
aspects which are coordinated by the sustainability steering committee
this chapter outlines the important environmental aspects related to grid development and the
management of a few specific impacts such as magnetic and electrical fields biodiversity power
consumption emissions the use of resources and waste                                                            g4en24
in 2016 as in the previous two years no spills of contaminating liquids were recorded two significant
accidents occurred to machinery at electrical substations which however did not cause any environmental
damage




managing the environmental impact of grid development


lines and local communities                                                                                        g4en27

                                                                                                                   g4so2
the construction of new lines responds to the technical needs of the electricity system  such
as removing congestion and eliminating risks of overload  and to increasing energy production and
consumption which accompanies the economic growth of specific areas or of the entire country terna
adds the required new projects to the grid development plan which involves a complex authorisation
process every year
while grid development caters to societys general interest the environmental impact of the construction
of new power lines is instead concentrated on the area affected by the line route in addition the population
density of many parts of italy and the artisticcultural value and landscape of many other parts make
planning more complex and construction more difficult
as regards existing lines on the other hand the need to intervene is usually due to the fact that many of
these lines were built some decades ago the gradual urbanisation of rural areas and the adoption of new
legal regulations modifying parameters already in force regarding the interaction between power lines
and the land mean that changes to portions of the existing grid become necessary
the environmental actions preceding the coming into operation of grid development investments are
described below



planning
from the grid development and adjustment planning stage terna has made use of assessments based on
digital thematic maps mostly from official sources regions river basin authorities the company audit
system organised across an extensive database that is constantly updated interventions with which
terna can reduce the impact of power lines on the environment can be attributed to two categories

      rationalisation complex work which involves several grid components at the same time
       consisting of replacing some plants with better systems eliminating the parts of the grid which
       are of negligible use following new constructions or adding new grid elements to avoid having to
       upgrade saturated lines
       given the significance that visual impact on the landscape holds within ternas environmental
       impacts the physical removal of power lines is one of the most important effects ternas business
       has on the environment also in terms of use of terrain
       in 2016 290 km of lines were demolished this was an exceptional amount due to the removal of
       over 200 km of obsolete power lines in valtellina the result of activities begun in previous years
       net of this removal demolition involved around 80 km in line with previous years around 100 km
       year in the 20102016 period 9038 km of lines were demolished
       demolitions are defined as overhead lines that have been physically removed or replaced by cable
       lines and do not include declassified or enhanced lines

               reclassification that is converting existing power lines to a higher voltage by installing new
                conductors and pylons in place of the existing ones this can involve replacing old pylons with
                larger ones which therefore take up more space reclassification compared with constructing a
                new line has the advantage of generally using preexisting infrastructural corridors avoiding
                taking over new land



      consultation
      since 2002 terna has voluntarily brought forward discussions with local communities to the project
      planning stage of its development plan the dialogue with local institutions at the consultation stage
      and the strategic environmental assessment sea procedure of the development plan and the public
      initiatives for citizens of the local communities that are directly affected by the move to new infrastructures
      offer indications for mitigating the environmental impact at the design stage see also page 84



      design
      the search for the route for the construction of a power line is the most delicate design stage because
      it is the choice of route that can mitigate or affect interferences with the surrounding landscape and
      community
      therefore terna researches design solutions that minimise as far as is possible soil consumption
      interference with areas of environmental natural landscape and archaeological value whether urbanised
      or urban development areas and the sacrifice required by the properties involved this is with the
      exception of where a route is needed to enable the regular operation and maintenance of the power
      line during the design stage terna considers problems related to vegetation cutting right from the initial
      stages adopting methods and tools that aim to reduce interference to a minimum

               optimising the height of pylons and their locations
               studying site plans with the aim of using existing roads or routes reducing the creation of new
                routes especially in wooded or protected areas

                                                                                                  environment   129



the drafting of the environmental impact study provides detailed indications on the various components
that assist designers in transforming the route into an optimised project
great attention is paid to minimising visual impact which where it is not mitigable using precise suitable
location choices andor taking advantage of morphology can make use of the following actions

      choosing pylons with a reduced visual impact in recent years terna has expanded the available
       alternatives also turning to new singlestem pylons with a low environmental impact occupying
       10 square metres of ground surface compared to the 150 square metres for truncated pyramidal
       pylons and to internationally renowned architects to design new pylons that blend in better
       with the landscape the indication for using these types of pylons are mainly endorsed by park
       authorities or landscape superintendencies for the construction of new electrical substations
       similar considerations apply

      use of underground cables which eliminates or reduces the visual impact typical of overhead
       stretches of power lines which are negatively perceived especially in builtup areas however
       burying cables although appreciated and requested by local institutions is problematic from a
       technical and economic point of view underground lines are less reliable over time than overhead
       lines and require more time for repairs in the event of a malfunction for this reason they often do
       not ensure adequate security for the electricity system or service continuity in addition buried
       cables cause a greater impact in the construction stage  for example in terms of road traffic  and
       much higher construction costs from five to ten times the cost of an overhead line

       130   2016 sustainability report




             construction
             terna manages the environmental impacts of its construction sites via the management of the environmental
             aspects during plant construction operating guidelines in line with the groups environmental policy and
             current legislations adopted in february 2016
             the main changes introduced include

                     the environmental officer a role which is tasked with overseeing the environmental requirements
                      contained in the eia decrees and the opinions of environmental bodies and respecting legal
                      obligations also in reference to the activities conducted by contractors
                     environmental monitoring of the indicators provided by iso 14001 conducted under the
                      supervision of site assistants concerning complaintsreports environmental accidents waste and
                      the consumption of energy and natural resources

             particular attention has been paid to identifying construction site areas and access routes which are
             located where compatible with the technical and planning needs in areas of less naturalistic value
eu13         when the project is complete terna provides for the restoration of the sites involved back to their
             original state where such areas include natural or seminatural habitats specific actions are carried
             out in addition to normal recovery work which are based on naturalistic engineering techniques that
             aim to create environments that are suitable for plant andor animal species or communities habitat
             reconstruction living native plants that do not require watering or special fertilisation materials even
             inert infrastructures and other measures aiming to create favourable living conditions for animal species
             httpswwwaipinit
             ternas environmental policies which are applied also at construction sites were formulated according
             to the provisions of the applicable environmental laws and the prescriptions of the iso 14001 standard
             these include aspects such as preventive measures against contaminating aquifers limiting damage
             to vegetation managing accidents minimising air and noise emissions and vehicle use and correctly
             managing waste and excavated land see page 149 these aspects are voluntarily improved with additional
             precautionary principles internal audit campaigns on construction sites allow for any deviations from the
             companys environmental policies to be monitored
             additional operating guidelines were adopted in october 2016 that aim to ensure compliance with the
             requirements



             requirements
             requirements usually technical andor environmental in nature are indicated by the authorising body
             and in conjunction with national regional and local legislation constitute a binding regulation for the
             proposing party for the executive planning and construction of the work itself
             in most cases they accentuate or better define the mitigations proposed in the environmental impact study
             or impose new ones on the advice of specialised bodies superintendencies river basin authorities park
             authorities etc
             such mitigation once constructed will further lower the effect of the impacts estimated in the study the
             monitoring plan which is drafted for all terna works that undergo an environmental impact assessment
             the requirements can also be compensatory when a residual impact is not considered to be sufficiently
             mitigated the competent authority assesses an intervention in a different location to the plant with
             environmental balance value which would benefit the area for example the reconstruction of a vegetation
             habitat or the restoration of an architecturalcultural property etc

                                                                                                     environment   131



mitigation and compensation                                                                                         g4en13
in compliance with the requirements expressed during the authorisation procedure andor on a voluntarily
basis terna adopts mitigation measures to reduce the impact andor improve integration into the
environment of the electrical structures
in particular terna creates systems to hide its own electrical substations from places frequented by
tourists or those of landscapeenvironmental interest redevelops assets with cultural importance during
the design phase prefers to locate lines where they take advantage of natural morphology and makes
use of naturalistic engineering techniques for restoration after demolitions reconstructing habitats and
stabilising slopes or embankments
if the mitigation measures are not sufficient to reduce the interference to insignificant levels environmental
offsetting measures are adopted that is environmental regeneration or habitat reconstruction work on
areas close to the power line such as balancing out the trees cut along the lines in the projects by planting
individual trees of the same species over equivalent areas
throughout 2016 3 vegetation redevelopment projects were carried out and 3 executive designs were
completed 5 projects are being constructed in 2017 which also includes executive projects made in
previous years




monitoring and supervision of electromagnetic fields

protecting the public from exposure to electromagnetic fields is precisely defined by law the relative
legislation prime ministers decree of 8 july 2003 establishes

      exposure limits in case of exposure to electric and magnetic fields at a frequency of 50 hz
       generated by power lines the limit is 100 microteslas for magnetic induction and 5 kvm for the
       electric field understood as effective values
      caution values as a precautionary measure protecting against the possible longterm effects
       of exposure to magnetic fields generated at the grid frequency 50 hz in childrens play areas
       residential areas school sites and places where people stay for at least four hours a day the
       caution value for magnetic induction is 10 microteslas understood as the median value over 24
       hours under normal operating conditions
      quality objectives in planning new power lines near sensitive areas as above and in planning new
       settlements and areas in the vicinity of lines and installations already present the quality objective
       is set at 3 microteslas for the value of magnetic induction understood as the median value over
       24 hours under normal operating conditions this is in order to gradually minimise exposure to
       electric and magnetic fields generated by power lines operating at a frequency of 50 hz to ensure
       that quality objectives are met in agreement with the regional environmental protection agencies
       monitoring plans with electric and magnetic field measurements can be provided for new power
       lines both in the pre and postconstruction stages

the values of the three parameters and in particular the caution value 10 microteslas and the quality
objective 3 microteslas show that the italian legislator has adopted the precautionary approach expressed
by article 15 of the rio principles these parameters are amongst the lowest in europe in order to comply
with the law terna must adopt the same principle in its work
terna performs inspections on its own lines to guarantee compliance with the limits provided for by
current legislation and researches innovative technological solutions to mitigate magnetic fields in the
event of any reports and requests by responsible bodies and administrations terna provides the data

 eu13         safeguarding biodiversity
g4en27
              the relationship between the terna grid and the surrounding natural environment and consequently its
g4en12       impact on biodiversity can assume different features
              in the grid construction stage the impact on biodiversity is associated with site work opening up
g4en13       routes so as to be able to erect pylons excavate and remove residual materials
              in this phase the potential disturbances at the site areas and any access routes are temporary and
              reversible
              in the operating stage of existing lines the potential impact on biodiversity is twofold on the one
              hand the line route may contribute to increasing biodiversity and protecting certain species because
              the pylons and their bases constitute islands of concentrated biodiversity sparing areas of land from
              intensive farming on the other hand the lines potentially have negative effects on biodiversity in particular
              on birds and in protected areas or areas of particular natural interest
              the main tool used to identify critical line sections is a comprehensive regional database populated
              with data from the regions and ministries the geographic information system gis which allows for
              integrated analysis of all layers of information for various types of land use and protection constraints
              regional naturalistic cultural landscape etc using this tool terna has put together an inventory of all
              possible interference between its lines and areas with protected or high levels of biodiversity which
              is found in the table below

              on this basis potential threats deriving from the risk of collision concerning bird species included in the
              iucn red list were explored




              electrical lines and birdlife

              the presence of lines may cause potentially negative effects for birdlife
              while the risk of electrocution affects low and mediumvoltage lines and therefore does not affect terna
              plants highvoltage lines are associated with the risk of collision
              to minimise this risk for stretches of line where birds frequently cross special devices known as
              dissuaders have been installed due to their high visibility and the noise they make when the wind
              hits them they make electricity lines more easily perceptible to birds in flight
              over the years terna has initiated research and scientific studies to investigate this issue and identify
              increasingly effective solutions for example see the 2010 sustainability report page 116 ternalipu
              agreement study on the interaction between birdlife and the national electricity transmission grid
              the first italian study dedicate to the issue of collisions23 and based on the results of the ternalipu
              agreement it shows a low risk of collision




              22 the percentage of lines located in protected areas is calculated using the atlarete database which may present nonsignificant misa

tools for preventing the risk of collision
during 2016 terna in collaboration with cesi and the charles darwin biology and biotechnology
department at la sapienza university in rome developed avival a tool based on gis geographic
information system designed to help assess the suitability of a territory to host a power line the tool
considers the modelled distribution of all bird species across the area of interest the presence of protected
areas the susceptibility of the species to the presence of the line and the influence of environmental
factors on the potential collision risk
an additional tool is provided by the prior monitoring of the passages of migratory birdlife as part of
the preparatory activities for the construction of the sorgenterizziconi electrical line see page 106
terna has created a threeyear monitoring project using radar over the messina strait which to date
has allowed for over 50000 passages to be recorded broken down by number and altitude for birds of
prey and passerines which has not shown any collision phenomenon terna presented this experience
which constitutes an international best practice at the international radar aeroecology applications
and perspectives conference promoted by enram the european network for the radar surveillance of
animal movement which was held in rome on the 2324 february 2017
lastly in january 2016 experimentation began involving a section of the villanovagissi power line
and using avimon a device that detects impacts of birdlife with power line guard wires during the
two highest periods of bird traffic prereproduction and postreproduction no collisions were detected
confirming the results of previous onsite monitoring



identification and monitoring of bird species included on the iucn red list                                                                         g4en14

as part of its birdlife protection initiatives terna has conducted a study to identify the protected species
included on the iucn red list which may be affected by its infrastructures
the iucn red list is the largest existing database at an international level concerning the conservation
status of thousands of plant and animal species which are catalogued on the basis of their risk of extinction
when conducting its analysis terna specifically considered the presence of bird species belonging to the
iucn red list and natura 200024 sites protected areas with high levels of biodiversity approximately
3000 between spas and sci
the study selected the natura 2000 areas affected by ternas lines thereby verifying the protected species
that had chosen said areas as their habitat including those contained on the red list and classified as
vulnerable endangered critically endangered and extinct in the wild25 these species are a conservation
priority as without targeted interventions aimed at neutralising the threats in their regard and increasing their
populations in some cases their extinction is a real possibility the analysis showed that ternas electrical
infrastructures could interfere with the habitats of the following 8 species

24 natura 2000 is the main tool in the european unions policy on the conservation of biodiversity it is an ecological network that is spread
     across the entire european union established in accordance with the habitats directive no 9243eec to guarantee the longterm
     maintenance of natural habitats and plant and animal life that are at risk or are rare throughout the european union the natura 2000
     network is made up of sites of community importance sci identified by member states in accordance with that which is established in
     the habitat directive which were subsequently designated as special areas of conservation sacs and also includes special protection
     areas spas that were established pursuant to the 2009147ec birds directive concerning the conservation of wild bird species
25 there are 11 risk categories ranging from extinct ex which is applied to species for which there is definitive proof that the last member
     has died to the least concern lc category which is adopted for species that are not at risk of extinction in the short or medium term
     between the categories of extinction and least concern lie the endangered categories which identify the species that are at an increasing
     risk of extinction in the short or medium term vu  vulnerable en  endangered cr  critically endangered and ew  extinct in the wild

      in regards to the species that belong to the bat chiroptera family their biology excludes the risk of collision
      with fixed structures the results from a field research project conducted by terna have demonstrated the
      absence of line interference on the bats movements which fly through the spaces below power lines and
      even nest in the bat boxes installed on the pylons
      after checking scientific publications and targeted consultation no particular issues with the bird species
      became apparent with the exception of the corn crake a species found in the alpine area between
      friulivenezia giulia and lombardy which has a potential collision risk



      alternative uses of electrical lines
      terna has been creating projects aimed at finding alternative uses for electrical lines in partnership with
      environmental associations for some time the most important was carried out in collaboration with
      ornis italica and is called nests on pylons it consists of placing nesting boxes and conducting annual
      monitoring of the species occupying the nests and the outcome of their nesting season the project
      includes many species such as the kestrel peregrine falcon horned owl common cuckoo european
      roller bat and stork launched in 2015 the gis survey localisation using geographic coordinates of the

the birdcam project completes this project which provides for the installation of television cameras
on artificial nests to follow the birds reproduction period online on ternas website and on wwwbirdcam

climate change and energy efficiency

terna transmits electricity and has no production activities which in the electricity industry  and
among all business activities in general  are those most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions
therefore terna is not subject to emissionreduction obligations according to the kyoto targets nor to
emissiontrading schemes of any kind but it has still chosen to commit itself voluntarily to containing
emissions in this light terna responded to the urging of the international cdp organisation originally
carbon disclosure project and adhered to the international cdp road to paris26 initiative subscribing
to three commitments emission data transparency elimination from the supply chain of procurement
leading to deforestation and public support for the objective of reducing greenhouse gases as well as
monitoring and programmes to contain its emissions the investments included in the grid development
plan of terna lead to significant reductions in co2 emissions in the overall electricity system




26 cdp road to paris was the initiative promoted by cdp in july 2014 ahead of cop 21 paris december 2015

g4ec2     climate change risks and opportunities

           in line with the interest of stakeholders to assess the possible impact of climate change on ternas
           business risks connected with certain overarching trends can be assessed specifically those risks that
           are derived from regulatorylegislative frameworks physical risks and other risks connected to the role
           and activities of terna




            regulatory risks


            reduction                   terna is not involved in the generation of electricity and therefore is not
            of emissions                subject to any obligation to reduce emissions or to any emissiontrading
            emission trading          schemes accordingly any fiscal or regulatory measures eg carbon tax
            carbon tax                 or emissionreduction targets do not concern terna and have no direct
                                        consequences on its business and financial performance


            changes in                  research into greater efficiency has already reduced the elasticity of
            consumption                 energy demand to the growth of gdp the consequences for terna are
            and generation              very few the current regulatory framework significantly limits the risk

            physical risks associated with environmental conditions


            extreme weather             extreme weather conditions may also make it difficult for terna to balance
            conditions water           electricity inputwithdrawal on the transmission grid to address these
            shortage extreme           risks terna is carrying out research initiatives in two directions the first
            heat ice                  is oriented towards increasing knowledge of the potential consequences
                                        of extreme weather scenarios  in line with the ipcc intergovernmental

                                        specific adverse weather conditions see page 122


            other risks


            development of              this poses various operational and technological challenges for terna in
            the production              relation to the need to resolve grid congestion problems and for efficient
            of electricity              and safe management of nonprogrammable production for example
            from renewable              intermittent wind production makes dispatching more difficult
            sources

            reputational                as the probability of critical situations due to extreme weather events
                                        increases which can result in widespread disruption ternas exposure to
                                        reputation problems increases both relative to public authorities and the
                                        general public

                                                                                                  environment   137



climate change has encouraged the legislative framework to evolve in a way that favours renewable
sources and has led to a merging of guidelines also at an international level clearly seen during the
climate conference of december 2015 in paris cop21
terna strategic guidelines are coherent with international guidelines particularly when it comes to
decarbonisation and the transition to energy production using renewable sources the main opportunities
that climate change indirectly opens up for terna regard both regulated activities and new market
opportunities grid development investments meet a need to aid energy transition by strengthening
transmission capacity and interconnections with foreign countries and research and innovation are also
focused on identifying sustainable smart solutions that can be proposed to nonregulated activity
customers
for example terna is installing storage devices batteries which may actually encourage the use of
renewable sources while resolving grid regulation problems see page 101 in addition in 2016 terna
signed an agreement with rfi for the development of plants producing renewable sources see page 43
lastly we note ternas participation together with other energy infrastructure managers in a project to
identify and analyse methods of governing climate change risks requested and managed by the eni

the transmission of electricity requires direct consumption of energy only for a few activities that support     g4en5
the service in particular

      fuel for company operating vehicles helicopters and vehicles used for line inspections repairs
       and other activities mainly connected with the maintenance of lines and substations see the plant
       maintenance paragraph on page 111
      diesel for emergency generators which are used only in cases where electricity is lacking it is
       estimated that across italy generators were used for a total of 6124 hours consumption of 03 gj
       per hour
      heating oil and natural gas for heating offices

the indirect consumption of energy consists of the electricity used to run substations and operating plants
approximately 80 of the total and in offices and workshops the figure for office consumption is 130791
gj which as a ratio to ternas total employees net of bluecollar workers corresponds to per capita

sf6 leakage

thanks to its chemical and physical properties the gas sf6 sulphur hexafluoride is used as insulation in
certain electrical devices such as switches current transformers and armoured systems part of the gas
present in the devices is dispersed into the atmosphere owing to defective seals faults and sometimes
also during operations to restore pressure sf6 gas has an extremely powerful greenhouse effect equal
to 23500 times that of co227
sf6 leaks are the main source of direct greenhousegas emissions by terna in the last fiveyear
period the quantity of sf6 present in the terna groups plants increased by 172 tonnes 47 this is
a trend  common to many transmission operators  associated with the higher insulating properties of
the gas and with the smaller size of substations built with equipment containing sf6 compared to more
traditional solutions
in 2016 thanks to programmes to limit the proportion of sf6 leaks shown in the relevant paragraph
on page 144 and the absence of significant accidents leaks fell in absolute terms kg by 75
compared to the previous year the impact of leakage on total installed amounts  the most important
kpi for the containment measures adopted  in 2016 was 039 the lowest figure since measurement

             sf6 leaks comparative data

              sf6 gas is used by electricity transmission operators because of its excellent electrical insulation
              properties on account of its specific nature of use only other tso panels were compared
              the indicator compared was the proportion of leaks to the total quantity of gas installed in substation
              equipment in 2016 terna recorded a proportion of leaks of 039 for 2015 the year to which the
              comparison refers sf6 leaks were equal to 044
              in the comparison with other transmission operators for the year 2015 terna showed a slightly
              belowaverage proportion of sf6 leaks compared to the panel average both in terms of the simple
              average 050 and the weighted average 070 ie calculated as the ratio between the sum of

g4en15    direct and indirect co2 emissions
g4en16
           direct greenhousegas emissions connected with ternas work are mainly caused by sf6 leaks 87 of
           total direct emissions in 2016 which fell by 75 resulting in a decrease of 72 in total direct emissions
           indirect emissions have instead increased by 6 reflecting a diverse conversion factor relative to previous
           years more than an actual increase in consumption we note that for technical reasons the energy
           consumed by terna cannot be traced to a supply contract this makes it impossible for terna to reduce
           indirect emissions by selecting supplies from renewable sources and the need to use a conversion factor
           based on the average for italian electricity production

1 the conversion of direct energy consumption and sf6 sulphur hexafluoride and refrigerant gas leaks to equivalent co2 emissions is
    calculated this year using the parameters indicated in the ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 and greenhouse gas protocol ghg
    initiative this led to a change in the equivalent tonnes of sf6 and refrigerant gas and total direct emissions compared to that which was
    previously published
2 until 2014 data on refrigerant gas leaks was only collected for r22 since 2015 data collection was added for r407c and r410a in 2016
    there were no r22 leaks
3 the terna helicopter fleet has been operational since 2015
4 indirect consumption of electricity is converted taking into account the proportion of thermoelectric production in the total italian electricity
    production for 2016 the reference for the division of the production mix is the monthly report on the electricity system with the results
    for december 2016 available on the website wwwternait

        co2 emissions comparative data

         the figures used for comparison as regards the emission of co2 are composed of the figures related
         to direct and indirect emissions scopes 1 and 2
         the unit of measurement used for the comparison is the co2 equivalent expressed in thousands
         of tonnes where co2 equivalent means the total contribution of the greenhouse gases to the
         greenhouse effect
         the analysis was done by comparing ternas emission values with those of three corporate panels
         companies listed on the ftse mib the electric utilities on the dow jones sustainability world
         index and the tsos1
         in the absence of normalisation factors valid for all sectors it was deemed of interest to present the
         company data on co2 emissions in absolute terms  despite the poor comparability such figures
         which vary greatly in magnitude from one case to another at least provide an indication of the extent
         of greenhouse gas emissions  and therefore of the practical need to contain and mitigate them from
         the point of view of sustainability  in the various sectors and companies
         for 2016 co2 emissions attributed to ternas activities amounted to 1365 thousand tonnes on the
         other hand for 2015 the year with which a comparison can be made emissions were measured at
         1371 thousand tonnes of co2
         when compared with all three panels terna is significantly below the average for 2015 the data
         confirms the evidence for the previous threeyear period

in addition to the emissions corresponding to electricity consumption ternas most significant indirect
emissions are related to grid losses for the indicators relative to emissions produced by staff air miles

grid losses                                                                                                          eu12

grid losses are defined as the difference between energy input by producers including imported energy
and final consumption the losses relevant for terna are those associated with the transmission grid the
figure presented in the table below is based on the direct measurement of energy inputted and withdrawn
from the transmission grid approximately 7500 metres to which corrective technical coefficients are
applied in cases in which the measuring point does not coincide with the boundaries of the transmission
grid terna is responsible for measuring the energy input into the ntg while for the energy withdrawn on
the basis of specific agreements terna may read the measurements remotely which however remain the
responsibility of the distributor companies this entails a margin of error concerning the correctness of
the measurements of electricity withdrawn which moreover has tended to reduce over the years thanks
to crosschecks and the gradual resolution of discrepancies with the distributors data
in order to reduce the margin of error and the risk of interpreting the effect of measurement errors and
related corrections as real trends starting from 2012 it was decided to use the simple moving average of
losses with a threeyear window 20122014 for the year 2014 20132015 for the year 2015 20142016 for
2016 as the annual figure

 grid


terna can only contribute to determining the amount of losses which are not completely under its control
dispatching  needed to ensure the constant balance between injections and withdrawals and to avoid
gridsecurity and servicedisruption problems  takes place according to regulated criteria within the
scope of production setup determined by the energy market and cannot be conditioned by terna so as
to minimise losses
grid development however with equal production setups would lead to greater efficiency and thus a
reduction in losses however the real impact of grid development on losses cannot be predetermined nor
is it under the control of the grid operator since it depends on the evolution of production capacity and
the demand and supply of electricity on a local basis
the co2 emissions associated with grid losses amounted to 1733251 tonnes for the year 2016 1700916
in 2015 and 1646235 in 2014 the trend differs from the losses measured in gwh due to modifications in
the conversion factor for transforming energy into equivalent co2 emissions which  in turn  is affected
by the changes in the production mix of the italian generation system

g4en19    initiatives to reduce emissions

           terna focuses its attention on a number of voluntary action programmes aimed at reducing its main
           sources of greenhousegas emissions which consist in particular of

                   a programme to limit the proportion of sf6 leaks terna has launched several initiatives such
                    as identifying leaks promptly by means of online monitoring systems and seeking technological
                    solutions which improve the sealing of equipment and components
                   a programme for energyefficient buildings
                   feasibility studies for energy conservation initiatives in electrical substations



           limiting sf6 leakage
           terna works to keep sf6 leaks under control limit and where possible reduce their percentage as a
           ratio to the total gas used in fact if leaks in absolute terms increase owing to the greater use of gas a
           reduction in the proportion of leaks would precisely for this reason have a significant impact in terms of
           emissions avoided
           the identification of a reduction target is affected by several elements of uncertainty

                   the growth of awareness of and attention to the issue has been reflected in an improvement in
                    measuring leaks entailing  precisely in the years when limiting activity began 20092010  worse
                    performance in all probability only apparent
                   the occurrence of faults with significant gas leaks  the probability of which is growing given the
                    increasing use of sf6 gas in equipment at large substations  can alter the trend considerably
                   while on the one hand installing equipment with better sealing performance tends to reduce the
                    proportion of leaks on the other the ageing of equipment already installed could entail an increase
                    in leaks

           net of exceptional faults and any effect deriving from the ageing of the equipment in operation it is
           estimated that installing new devices with better seals such as more highly reliable transformers which
           began in 2009 and continued in the years 20102012 may determine a reduction in the proportion of
           leaks of approximately 01 over the period of five years of the installation campaign on the basis of this
           estimate and again net of the factors mentioned we expected the proportion of leaks to be placed around
           06 considering that the average proportion in the 20072008 period was 07 net of exceptional
           faults therefore the effective proportion recorded 039 in 2016 represents a better result than the
           expected target which however given the average proportion recorded by european tsos 070 see
           the comparative data box on page 140 remains a terna objective up to and including 2018

energy management system

in line with its sustainable business approach terna promotes energy efficiency and saving
in 2012 the company launched the energy consumed for own use management system project
to provide the group with a corporate management system that complies with the uni cei en iso
500012011 standard
to achieve the objective of uni cei en iso 500012011 certification for terna spa terna rete italia spa
terna plus srl and terna crna gora obtained in december 2015 and comply with the commitments
established by italian legislative decree 1022014 and the guidelines issued by the med which obliged
large companies to carry out again by 2015 a series of energy audits on a significant sample of company
sites the following were carried out

      initial energy analysis
      energy analyses at relevant sites rome milan florence naples palermo cagliari rome campus
       and the security operation centresoc rome
      energy analysis of the terna gora headquarters
      energy analysis of the terna gora construction site
      energy analyses of 18 electrical substations the three largest in rondissone dugale and north
       rome
      the ginestra site for nonconventional storage systems
      the physicalchemical laboratory in rome and the genzano di lucania construction site

the energy analyses were conducted in compliance with current legislation italian legislative decree
1022014 and the use and consumption of all energy carriers electricity diesel oil for generators natural
gas heating oil and car fuel were examined on account of the fact that they are relevant aspects for the
group
realtime energy consumption sensors were installed which power an energy dashboard for 9 important
offices the rome headquarters milan padua florence palermo cagliari rome campus and the rome
security operation centre soc
during 2016 the uni cei en iso 500012011 energy management systems  requirements and guidelines
for use and uni cei en 16247 energy diagnosis course was given to around 60 people including energy
officers and assessors in addition to increase energysaving awareness within the company a poster
campaign was carried out which was linked to an email address in order to gather suggestions
in july 2016 a positive result followed on from an audit by the certifying body in order to maintain the

energy efficiency in substations and offices                                                                        g4en6
at terna the development of energy efficiency programmes relative to the use of electricity in substations
and offices is experimental at this stage as electricity consumption falls within the own transmission
use category which in accordance with the provisions of the sector authority are not included within
ternas operating expenses
in offices the main sources of energy consumption are related to lighting airconditioning heating and
the use of computers and printers
the renovation and new construction of terna sites should be noted first and foremost which  on
the basis of a multiyear programme  tend to raise the energy class of group owned properties thereby
accompanying construction with an improvement in energy efficiency standards
during 2016 the construction of the new turin office and the remodelling of the palermo offices contributed
to improving the energy class of ternas main buildings in line with the objective to bring these buildings to
70 expressed as a  of total cubage in the offices considered in classes a b or c by 2020 45 in 2015
we also note initiatives launched in previous years which concern the reduction in these consumption
sources and for which we can measure the obtained benefits

146   2016 sustainability report




              tradingin computers and printers the new models enable savings in average energy consumption of
               around 133 and a consequent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions the reduction achieved in
               2016 adds to those already recorded in 2012 for a total of 242 tonnes of co2 emissions
              the replacement of heating oil boilers with two heat pumps and a series of geothermal probes at the
               offices of the friulivenezia giulia plants unit the investment initiated in 2014 has a payback period
               of 5 years and has allowed for a reduction in costs and consumption related to heating oil this has
               led to a reduction in co2 emissions into the atmosphere amounting to a total of 150 tonnes of co2

      among the initiatives begun in 2016 we note the switch to led bulbs in the pero offices milan and the
      installation of innovative light towers with led technology in the basiliano electrical substation udine
      the benefits for these projects in terms of carbon dioxide reduction will be quantified at the end of 2017




      the development plan and reduction of co2 emissions from
      the electricity system

      the construction of the new lines and substations provided for by the development plan will have positive
      effects not only in terms of service security and the final cost of electricity but also in terms of reduced
      emissions from the electricity system the effects achievable upon completion of the plan can be
      attributed to three categories

              reduction of grid losses
              improvement of the production mix and interconnection with other countries
              connection of plants using renewable energy

      overall the reduction in co2 emissions could reach approximately 13 million tonnes a year



      reduction of grid losses
      grid losses depend among other things on the distance the electricity travels on the transmission grid
      in the simplest terms the further the point of consumption of withdrawal from the ntg from the point
      of production of delivery into the ntg the greater the losses for the same consumption in addition for
      the same distance the losses are greater on a lowervoltage line development work that improves the
      grid mesh structure brings withdrawal and consumption points closer all other conditions being equal
      the result is a reduction in grid losses the same result is produced by upgrading a stretch of the grid for
      example when a 400 kv line replaces one at 150 kv over the same route the entry into service of the main
      development interventions provided for in the 2017 development plan will lead to a reduction in energy
      losses on the grid estimated at being around 830 gwhyear assuming that the reduction of these losses
      is equivalent to a reduction in production from combustible sources it is possible to quantify a decrease
      in co2 emissions of somewhere between 500000 and 600000 tonnes every year

                                                                                                                         environment    147



improvement of the production mix and interconnection with other countries
one of the main purposes of developing the electricity transmission grid is to overcome the transport
limits between electricity zones the existence of these limits imposes a number of restrictions on the
possibility of production by more efficient generation units namely units which pollute less in terms of co2
emissions and at the same time makes production by obsolete substations necessary for grid security
the work envisaged in the development plan together with the expansion of interconnection with other
countries would enable a more efficient production mix with a larger proportion of production by plants
with higher yields the same final consumption quantity would thus be fulfilled with a smaller quantity of
fuel the benefits are quantifiable as a reduction in co2 emissions of up to around 7246757 tonnes a year



connection of plants using renewable energy
the main contribution to the reduction of co2 emissions comes from connecting production plants using
renewable sources considered among the projects in the 2017 development plan the production of
energy from renewable sources has represented an energy potential that has seen strong growth in recent
years specifically wind and photovoltaic generation plants have increased substantially especially in
italys southern regions and islands
one of ternas main tasks is to plan ntg upgrading in order to encourage production of electricity from
renewable energy sources the aim is to try to overcome any grid and operating limitations that could
impact renewableenergy input into the grid which is entitled to dispatching priority
the development solutions planned in response to these critical areas include both action to strengthen
sections of the primary grid which make it possible to indirectly reduce the limits on the operation of
nprs production and action to locally expand the subtransmission grids to which the nprs generation
is directly connected see the relevant section on pages 108110 besides this work nprs collection
stations on the primary 400 kv grid are planned which will make it possible to limit the construction
of new 150 kv power lines which would otherwise be needed the works included by terna in the 2017
development plan will release about 4350 mw of power from renewable sources thus obtaining a
reduction of co2 emissions amounting to around 5600000 tco2year



reduction of co2 emissions in 2016
in 2016 the benefits in terms of reduction of co2 emissions were mainly due to the installation of new
zeroemission production units
the provisional figure for power installed from renewable sources in 2016 is presented below



  energy source                                                       power installed  mw

from the 2016 provisional figures it can be seen that in 2016 the gross production using wind and
photovoltaic energy increased by approximately 2730 gwh this figure corresponds to a reduction of
approximately 152 million tonnes of co229



29 considered as a conversion ratio of 0557 tco2mwh and assuming that the new renewable capacity installed replaces an equivalent
     thermoelectric capacity

           resource use and waste management

           the provision of the transmission service requires the construction and maintenance of a large endowment
           of capital assets power lines pylons conductors insulators transformer substations transformers
           switches other substation equipment and control systems are the main components
g4en8     the use of materials is related in particular to constructing new electricity and ict infrastructure
           water is not used in the electricity transmission and dispatching production cycle normally the water
           used  for hygienic use to clean offices and for cooling systems  comes from connections to the water
           mains for civil use water consumption is shown in the key indicator tables on page 202

most of ternas waste is recovered to be sent for production recycling only some residues are sent to the
wastedisposal sites and therefore have an environmental impact
93 of waste was recovered in 2016 92 in 2015 and 81 in 2014
such waste derives mainly from maintenance and modernisation works to the electricity infrastructure
activities which depend on technical considerations regarding the security and efficiency of the system
which therefore may change significantly from year to year
actual recycling depends on the materials which make up the waste some materials can easily be
separated and consequently reused for example the iron parts of pylons however in some cases it is
impossible or too costly to separate the parts especially for equipment purchased some years ago
for these reasons the annual changes in the percentage of waste recycled must not be interpreted
as representing a trend

1 this includes only the special waste from the production process not that produced by service activities urban waste this does not
    include waste relative to sewage and waste deriving from septic tanks coming from substations not connected to the sewer network
    the amount of sewage and septic tanks amounted to 789 tonnes in 2016 680 tonnes in 2015 and 383 tonnes in 2014 in 2014 waste
    identified as other emulsions amounting to 857 tonnes produced during an accident that occurred in an operating area was also
    excluded
2 they consist of uncontaminated metal waste deriving from the decommissioning of transformers electrical equipment and machines for
    example generators no longer in use with a recovery percentage that averages 100
2 waste sent for disposal may differ from the simple difference between waste produced and recovered owing to the temporary storage of
    waste



the main hazardous special waste produced by ternas operating activities consists of

        metal waste which derives from the decommissioning of transformers electrical equipment
         and machinery no longer used and contaminated by hazardous substances more than 95 of
         which is recycled on average after treatment by third parties
        batteries lead and nickel which in the event of a blackout enable emergency generators to
         be turned on to keep the energy transportation and transformation service operating during
         emergencies 100 of which are recycled
        dielectric oils for the insulation of transformers replaced following the regular checks carried out
         for transformer maintenance and which constitute hazardous waste with a recovery rate of 85

     150   2016 sustainability report




           waste sent for disposal consists mainly of materials used in the maintenance and cleaning of plants
           mud oil emulsions and rags containing oils and solvents and insulating materials containing asbestos
           for which no kind of recycling is available




g4en31    costs for the environment

           ternas commitment to the environment is reflected in the costs incurred for environmental reasons both
           as investment and as operating expenses environmental costs were shown separately on the basis of
           the definitions presented below by aggregating information deducible from the companys general and
           management accounting such definitions and the methodology described below have been taken from
           the operating guidelines of the terna group




           recording methods

           environmental costs are identified firstly on the basis of the definitions available in particular those of
           the istat the italian national institute of statistics eurostat and the gri as well as on the european
           commissions recommendation on the recognition measurement and disclosure of environmental
           issues in annual accounts and annual reports recommendation 2001453ec on the basis of this
           recommendation the term environmental expenditure includes the cost of steps taken by an organisation
           or on its behalf by others to prevent reduce or repair damage to the environment which results from its
           operating activities
           secondly the aforesaid definitions were applied to the environmental aspects considered significant for
           example the noise of substations electromagnetic fields etc in the companys iso 14001certified
           environmental management system to identify in the main corporate processes ternas operating and
           investment activities of environmental significance
           many of ternas activities described in this report entail environmental expenses however several
           limitations were introduced in determining the reporting boundary

                   exclusion of integrated costs ie regarding activities whose purpose is not exclusively environmental
                    for example the use of pylons with innovative features also from the point of view of environmental
                    integration because of the subjectivity of accounting for only environmental components
                   exclusion of the additional costs connected with the consideration of restrictions or requests for
                    safeguarding the environment during planning and designing new lines detours and burials

           other conditions were that the costs had to be

                   significant
                   consistent with the annual reporting of accounts operating costs and investment clearly
                    distinguished
                   directly recognisable on the basis of the existing corporate accounting system

           this last condition fulfils the need to minimise recourse to estimates based on nonaccounting analyses

                                                                                                                                       environment      151

the table below best shows the investments and operating costs incurred by terna for the environment
see the relevant information box for more details on the accounting method used
these costs exclude expenses regarding internal resources and consider only expenses for external
purchases an exception is the environmental activities  existing plants item which includes the costs
of internal personnel
in accordance with the method adopted and the footnotes to the table it should be noted that the

1 environmental offsets these are amounts for offsetting the works set out in the grid development plan as determined by special
    agreements entered into with local institutions
2 environmentalimpact studies these relate to plants provided for in the grid development plan that are at the construction stage or in
    the process of being authorised by the competent administrations
3 environmental activities  new plants the amount shown is based on an estimate on the basis of an analysis of several large
    investment projects it turned out that at least 1 of the total expenses of the project regard environmental items usually determined by
    obligations for example masking with trees barriers against noise installation of dissuaders for birdlife environmental monitoring analysis
    of excavated earth and rocks therefore a value of 1 of investment costs for projects with similar features was considered
4 environmental activities  existing plants the expenses for upgrading existing plants in accordance with environmental provisions and
    new regulations for example noise and visuallandscape aspects
5 demolitions the costs for the definitive dismantling of lines as part of rationalisation projects in 2016 we also note two demolition
    projects involving 176 km on the grossottolovero sondrio and milano stazzona como power lines the activity performed directly by
    the engineering unit from the milan operating area is not added to the item in the table as the methodology determined in 2010 does not
    include projects carried out directly by the operating areas which are normally of little significance this project cost around  700000 in
    2017 the possibility of amending the methodology to insert other similar cases in the future will be evaluated

exception of 2015 which was affected by the generational turnover project implemented by the group
during that year
retirement is the main reason for employees leaving the leaving rate for spontaneous resignations has
remained very low despite having increased compared to the previous two years 060 in 2016 035
in 2015 032 in 2014 the increase in leaving rate for employees under 30 years of age 19 affected

          management of generational turnover

          the company concluded the initiative in 2015 which was launched in the last quarter of 2014 and aimed
          at bringing forward generational turnover through incentives for the voluntary retirement of employees
          close to pension age terna has therefore implemented staff rationalisation and reorganised corporate
          procedures with the aim of rebalancing the professional and demographic composition of the workforce
          the redundancy and retirement initiatives were countered by intensive personnel selection and hiring
          initiatives which lead to generational turnover in the workforce of the terna group for further details
          please see the 2015 sustainability report on pages 125126
          some time ago the terna group began a series of initiatives to better manage generational turnover the
          most significant include the transmission of knowledge and experience which are often exclusive by
          increasing use of training courses taught by inhouse teaching staff and professional development projects
          aimed at creating and transmitting technical and managerial skills enabling adequate performance of
          critical roles the increase in the number of training hours given in 2016 also reflects training reserved for
          new hires in 2015

 staff turnover comparative data

  ternas staff turnover rate is defined as the ratio of employees leaving during the year against the
  number of employees as at 31 december of the previous year
  as the staff turnover rate is an indirect indicator of the internal company climate affecting all divisions
  the figures for the transmission companies tso panel and those of the large companies listed on
  the italian stock exchange ftse mib were taken into account as well as those for companies in the
  electric utilities sector included in the dow jones world sustainability index
  in 2016 ternas turnover rate was 15 in line with the trend recorded up until 2015 in 2015 the year
  for which comparative data is available ternas turnover rate was impacted by the implementation
  of the generational turnover programme amounting to 138 net of incentivised redundancies the
  turnover rate would have been 1
  considering the average rates recorded in the comparison group which are in line with those of
  previous years it emerges that the terna turnover rate before 2015 and  in 2015  net of the
  generational turnover programme was well below the average of all the panels considered


                                                                 turnover rate   2015

departments and analysed the skills required to meet the groups strategic objectives the projects
outcomes will allow for targeted development strategies to be defined through job rotation and training
initiatives which will be tailored to each individual professional group
a new assessment and performance appraisal model will be an integral part of this system
measurement of performance is also related to payment of the variable parts of the remuneration various
tools are used to do so according to the type of corporate figures involved and the time horizon of the
results to which they refer

      is among the most stringent in europe and obliges companies to carry out a detailed assessment of the
      risks for workers health and safety terna specifically focuses on analysing the risks deriving from the

  as required by gri protocols the definitions adopted are those provided for by the international labour organization ilo to facilitate
     comparison with other sources the following notes show the figures of the same indicators calculated with alternative formulae it was
     not considered necessary to further break down the data by region because terna operates only in italy
     injury rate this is the number of injuries with at least one days abstention from work divided by the number of hours worked during
     the year and multiplied by 200000 corresponding to 50 working weeks x 40 hours x 100 employees to facilitate comparison with
     other sources this indicator was also calculated using a multiplication factor of 1000000 instead of 200000 consequently obtaining
     an injury rate five times that of the ilo with this calculation method the injury rate came out at 50 in 2016 42 in 2015 and 63 in
     2014
     lostday rate this is the ratio between the days not worked owing to injury and hours worked in the year multiplied by 200000
     days not worked are calendar days counted from when the injury occurred to facilitate comparison with other sources this indicator
     was also calculated using a multiplication factor of 1000 with this calculation method the lostday rate came out at 016 in 2016 02
     in 2015 and 02 in 2014
     absentee rate this is the number of days of absence owing to illness strikes and injuries out of the number of days worked in the
     same period multiplied by 200000 to facilitate comparison with other sources this indicator was also calculated as a percentage of
     days worked with this calculation method the absentee rate came out at 34 in 2016 36 in 2015 and 36 in 2014
     occupational disease rate this is the total number of cases of occupational disease divided by the hours worked in the year
     multiplied by 200000
 1 to calculate the lostday rate the days not worked related to injuries occurring in 2016 were considered together with any continued
     absence related to injuries occurring during the previous years following the criterion of annual accrual of days of absence
 2 the reasons for absence considered do not include maternity leave marriage leave study leave leave for trade union activities other
     cases of paid leave and suspensions
 3 in 2016 as in previous years no cases of workrelated illness for terna employees was ascertained no hours of absence were
     ascribable to occupational disease because the type of activities carried out by terna does not entail any work associated  on the
     basis of the official legal tables  with the possible onset of occupational diseases ternas occupational disease rate must therefore be
     considered to be always zero

           terna adopts systems for selecting developing and paying personnel that recognise and reward merit
           all forms of discrimination beginning with the selection and hiring process are explicitly forbidden by the
           groups code of ethics
           a large majority of employees are men because of the traditional scarcity of female labour supply in more
           technical occupations however the presence of women is increasing partly as a result of the general
           trend in the labour market which has seen a greater participation of women
           the percentage of female employees at terna in italy was 90 at the end of 2005 the year in which terna
           gained operating autonomy and has grown continually to reach 117 at the end of 2016 202 of all
           new employees net of bluecollar workers are women 162 in 2015
           the main indicators chosen by terna to monitor the equal treatment of men and women show that the
           management and development systems adopted do not disadvantage women in particular we note that
           the percentage of women managers relative to total managers 173 is again in 2016 higher than the ratio
           of women to all employees net of bluecollar workers 166 remuneration figures also show limited
           gaps between whitecollar workers and junior executives with wider gaps for senior managers where
           however fewer individuals are considered and the differences in salary are therefore more influenced by
           individual figures

methodological note


170   2016 sustainability report




      methodological note

      the sustainability report as at 31 december 2016 hereinafter sustainability report 2016 of the
      terna group was prepared according to the grig4 guidelines and the g4 sector disclosureelectric
      utilities update issued in 2013 by gri  global reporting initiative as in the last few years the report
      was approved by terna spas board of directors and subjected to specific auditing procedures the
      assurance report prepared by pricewaterhousecoopers is provided as an annex
      the grig4 guidelines were applied according to the core option
      the process of preparing the document involved identifying the significant aspects to report see the
      materiality paragraph below and presenting the performance achieved by the group in relation to such
      aspects and the sustainability targets
      the period of observation is the year 2016 all data refer to the financial year ending on 31 december 2016
      at the descriptive level the significant changes occurring up to 28 february 2017 have also been indicated
      in compliance with the principles outlined by the international integrated reporting council iirc terna
      has published with reference to 2016 the integrated report coinciding with the report on operations
      in the annual financial report which also refers to many of the subjects covered in this sustainability
      report the discussion of the aforementioned topics is the same in both reports except where further
      detail is required pursuant for example to specific requirements in the gri guidelines the sustainability
      issues included in the integrated report were chosen based on materiality considerations


      materiality

      in 2013 terna conducted a materiality analysis in line with the grig4 standard resulting in the matrix
      that offers a compact assessment of significance from the point of view of group management and
      stakeholders this matrix was updated in 2014 and then maintained in 2015
      based on changes to the company new tools activated by terna to manage stakeholders and growing
      external emphasis on the issue eg amendments made to the requirements for certain iso certifications
      in 2016 terna decided it was appropriate to fully revise the analysis the revision process began with
      updating the thematic tree completed through the analysis of internal and external sources of data
      making it possible to identify and detail significant issues at the current time
      in addition to a comprehensive review of the terminological description of the issues one of the most
      important changes was the addition of strategic approach to stakeholder management as a transversal
      aspect which arose following the growing attention paid to this concept on both a national and
      international scale
      after the thematic tree was updated 22 interviews were carried out with management from all company
      departments to discuss relationships with stakeholders in general and more specifically the relative
      significance of the issues to be placed on the materiality matrix
      in regard to the updating of the relevance for terna dimension the interview concentrated on the
      importance attributed by management to the themes considering how they are reflected in internal rules
      procedures policies and guidelines targets and allocated resources as well as actual projects and
      activities this relevance actually conveyed the level of commitment already established by the group and
      structured in relation to each theme
      the updating of the relevance for stakeholders dimension began with the information held by the
      departments related to the requests and opinions of stakeholders for which they are responsible
      information that can be derived from many sources

              direct targeted and structured engagement initiatives eg climate surveys customer satisfaction
               surveys focus groups
              opinions expressed by stakeholders during the course of their relationship with terna eg email
               exchanges meeting minutes alignment meetings
              opinions expressed independently by stakeholders and passively acknowledged by terna eg
               press and web reviews position papers press releases
              evaluations made on opinions gained over time in relation to stakeholders

                                                                                                                                                                methodological note   171

 in reviewing the materiality matrix the single g4 aspects have been considered in constructing the

172   2016 sustainability report




      scope and indicators

      the data and information in the 2016 sustainability report refer to the terna group that is to say the scope
      which includes terna spa and the companies that were consolidated in the consolidated financial
      statements for the year ending 31 december 2016 the tamini group companies are the exception 
      unless explicitly indicated otherwise compared to the groups scope at 31 december 2016 the data in
      this report covers 951 of the groups revenue
      certain environmental and social indicators are available for the tamini group which are shown in the key
      indicator tables
      in accordance with the principle of materiality the data included in the sustainability report include all
      the companies with a significant impact on sustainability ie by size or rather the number of employees
      or by potential impact on the environment and society or rather the number of operationsactivities which
      took place during the year over which terna spa exercises control directly or indirectly that is to say
      for which it has the power to determine the financial and operational policies there are no relations with
      jointventures other subsidiaries or leased businesses that could significantly influence the boundary or
      the comparability of the environmental and social data
      the scope of environmental data for the terna group for 2016 does not include the impact of former rfi
      electrical substations acquired at the end of 2015 during 2016 in fact these assets were managed via a
      contract stipulated with the previous owners and only at the end of the year were some of the substations
      integrated into the management scope of the terna group from 2017 it will be possible to identify
      estimate environmental data for substations progressively integrated into the scope of the terna group
      throughout 2016 overseas activities did not involve any operations managed directly by the group
      that were of significant external impact for this reason such activities have not been included in the
      calculation of the indicators published in this report data for montenegrin subsidiary terna crna gora
      doo is included within the scope of sustainability indicators however except where explicitly indicated
      otherwise
      the data were calculated precisely on the basis of the entries in the general accounting and ternas other
      information systems in the case of estimates in determining the indicators the procedure followed is
      stated
      all the gri indicators published are listed below in the grig4 content index which also includes any
      limitations relative to the requirements

                                                                                             methodological note   173



comparative analysis of sustainability performance

convinced that a comparison of environmental social and governance performance is of interest not only
to the company itself but also to its stakeholders certain comparisons between ternas results and those
of other companies are included in the 2016 sustainability report as was the case in previous years the
comparative sustainability indicators regard the following themes co2 emissions sf6 leakage incidence
rate hours of training per capita provided to employees and the turnover rate on termination of personnel
listed below are the main criteria adopted in the analysis as an introduction to the reading and
interpretation of the comparisons of individual indicators in the report

      three panels of companies were identified the first was composed of the european transmission
       system operators and the major noneuropean operators in terms of kilometres of lines managed
       the second multisectoral in nature is made up of large italian companies the 40 listed companies
       of the ftse mib at 13092016 the third formed by the best international performers in the electric
       utilities  elc sector identified by the robecosam sustainability rating agency and included in the
       dow jones sustainability world index of september 2016 the aim of the three panels it to ensure
       also in relation to the type of indicator under examination a comparison between companies with
       the same operating characteristics an italian comparison and a comparison with top international
       performers in the same sector among the companies in the three panels consideration has been
       given to those who publicise information that is useful for making comparisons on their website
       with the sustainability report even if this has not been drafted according to gri guidelines or via
       other documentation hse report financial report etc this led to a reduction in the sample
       compared to the number of companies in the starting panel the comparative analysis entails
       reference to 2015 data since the comparisons were drafted when the 2016 reports were still being
       prepared as was the case for terna

it must be noted that despite the exclusion of data which were explicitly not consistent in numerous
cases doubts remain as to the actual comparability between companies especially in instances where
significant discrepancies exist between the declared data of some companies and the average value of
the reference group
in the co2 emissions comparison the data are expressed as physical quantities in absolute terms
and therefore show very different levels depending on the type of production activity and the size of
the company in this case the comparison provides information on the varying significance of the
environmental aspects being considered for the individual companies but does not fulfil the task of
making the performance comparable

targets with which they can compare their undertakings to that effect an additional important change
in regards to the past is constituted by global compacts active role in urging companies to accept the
common challenge presented by the sdgs thereby combining the capacity for identifying new business
opportunities with responsible practices
the 17 sdgs are divided into 169 subobjectives that touch on many sustainability issues see
transforming our world the 2030 agenda for sustainable development30 the following table shows
the relationship between the issues and the gri indicators published within this report which is the
result of the adoption of the sdg compass guide prepared by gri un global compact and the world
business council for sustainable development wbcsd31

1 the 2015 figure was recalculated with the final data from the same year for this reason it is different from the one given in the 2015
    sustainability report the data on power supplied for 2016 should be considered as provisional
2 the asa indicator measures ntg service availability calculated as the ratio between the sum of energy not supplied to users connected
    to the ntg ens and the energy put into the grid as of the date of drafting this document the 2016 values have not yet been totalled or
    approved by the aeegsi
3 average number of short and long blackouts calculated as the ratio between number of users directly connected to the ntg involved in
    the outages and number of users of the ntg as of the date of drafting this report the 2016 values are not yet available
4 average duration of electricity system ntg power outage in a year calculated as a ratio between energy not supplied in a given period
    ens figure and average power absorbed by the electricity system during the considered period the 2016 values are not available at the
    time of publishing this report
5 the index also includes energy not supplied to directly connected users as a result of events regarding other connection grids that are not
    part of the ntg and a figure for energy not supplied owing to events of force majeure or significant incidents significant incident is taken
    to mean any blackout with net energy not supplied of more than 250 mwh the figure that impacts on the rens index is the percentage
    that decreases as the energy not supplied for the single incident identified increases the lower the level of the indicator the better the
    service performance at the time of publication the totals for the rens indicator for 2016 had not yet been released by aeegsi

           1 in 2014 the impact from leakage included an event that occurred in a substation which resulted in the loss of 7841 kg of sf6 equivalent
               to 26 of the total losses recorded
           2 the conversion of direct energy consumption and sf6 sulphur hexafluoride and refrigerant gas leaks to equivalent co2 emissions is
               calculated this year using the parameters indicated in the ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 and greenhouse gas protocol ghg
               initiative this led to a change in the equivalent tonnes of sf6 and refrigerant gas and total direct emissions compared to that which
               was previously published until 2014 data on refrigerant gas leaks was only collected for r22 data collection for r407c and r410a
               began in 2015 it is estimated that the percentage of coverage for the total data is equal to 85 in 2015 there were no r22 leaks
               indirect consumption of electricity is converted taking into account the proportion of thermoelectric production in the total italian electricity
               production for 2015 the reference for the division of the production mix is the monthly report on the electricity system with the results
               for december 2015 available on the website wwwternait

1 until 2014 data on refrigerant gas leaks was only collected for r22 data collection for r407c and r410a began in 2015 it is estimated
    that the percentage of coverage for the total data is equal to 85
2 in order to evaluate co2 deriving from the air travel of employees the conversion factors indicated by the greenhouse gas protocol
    initiative have been used
3 the table shows the vehicles in the terna fleet which in the period in question filled up at least once as recorded on the fuel card only
    operating vehicles are considered for information on the consumption of the company fleet see the following fuel consumption tables
4 the figure is calculated on the basis of the values provided by car manufacturers in logbooks and on the mileage estimates of said vehicles
    the value expressed in the table represents 682 of the company fleet for 2015 in 2014 it referred to 662 of the fleet and in 2013
    627

           1 the outflows inflows for women and men show the ratio of employees divided by gender who left joined in the year to total employees
               divided by gender at 31 december of the previous year
           2 the figure is obtained from the ratio between promotions to junior executive that occurred during the year and employees categorised as
               whitecollar workers in the previous year calculated by gender promotions from bluecollar worker to whitecollar worker and from junior
               executive to senior executive were not considered because the number was not significant on an annual basis
           3 the figure is the result of the ratio between the annual basic pay for women for the different grades and the annual basic pay for men for
               the same grades the figure was not calculated for bluecollar workers because there are no women in that category
           4 the figure is the result of the percentage ratio between the total annual remuneration for women for the different grades and the total annual
               remuneration for men for the same grades the total remuneration includes besides basic pay production bonuses the different types of
               incentives and the value of the benefits received over the year
