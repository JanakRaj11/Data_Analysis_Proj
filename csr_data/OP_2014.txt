executive chairmans csr statement
the foundation of oppohjola groups operation is customer ownership in accordance with our basic mission we promote the
sustainable prosperity wellbeing and security of our ownermembers customers and operating regions through our local presence
our values that is peoplefirst approach responsibility and prospering together guide our decisionmaking we operate in the long
term

our social responsibility has been entered as an integral part of oppohjola groups strategy it guides our business so that we take the
responsibility aspect into consideration in product and service development and in how we go about financing investment and nonlife
insurance matters we will invest in active open and transparent communication and stakeholder engagement

we are one of finlands biggest employers our principle is that responsibility as an employer can only be achieved in the long run if we
have our finances in balance we have faith in finnish expertise we consider it a matter of honour to pull our weight in financing
public services we are one of the biggest payers of corporate income tax

responsibility is not just big words it also requires action in the context of corporate social responsibility csr we aim to pioneer in
the financial sector in finland we were among the first to make our corporate social responsibility report using the new g4
requirements of global reporting initiative gri that were updated in 2013 our work is made easier by the recent materiality analysis
which confirms that we have focused on the right issues in our csr programme oppohjola groups csr cornerstones consist of our
role in finnish society and in the creation of local wellbeing ethical business practices responsible products and services as well as
responsibility for stakeholders and the environment

we have adopted a code of business ethics that applies to the entire personnel uns global compact initiative and the international
agreements to which we are signatories require us to follow a set of common rules

2013 was successful for us also in terms of csr matters our financial performance is good and our market position became even
better at the same time we were able to maintain our capital adequacy at a good level 173 core tier 1 we also made progress in
terms of the targets we had set ourselves in the corporate social responsibility programme

oppohjola group breaths the same air as finland and as a major national player we have a large influence on finnish life and
wellbeing this is a heavy responsibility and therefore our group must be strong and live up to its expectations since the beginning of
the financial crisis that is during the last five years the corporate loan stock in the euro area has shrunk by 9 percent in the
meantime however the finnish corporate loan stock has gone up by an impressive 19 percent oppohjola group accounts for two
thirds of that increase this is one clear indication of our will to contribute to finlands wellbeing

in 2013 we invested a record amount almost 150 million euros on product and service development op mobiles growth into
becoming the primary point of access for private banking customers is ongoing users value our mobile services very highly and the
innovative pivo service is a forerunner in smart wallets with omasairaala hospital we are leading the way in the development of
health care processes

our helsinki premises the vallila 2015 office building project is proceeding according to plans and has already been awarded its first
leed certificate we are also making a donation to the new childrens hospital in helsinki it is a major project and an investment that
will provide many jobs for years to come

the instability of our operating environment goes on and economic growth is expected to be modest at the same time the financial
sector is undergoing radical changes low interest rates and slow growth structural changes taxation and tighter and tighter
regulation have an effect on operations and the effects can be felt all the way to the customers the new situation requires banks to
have much bigger economic buffers even though the operating environment is changing we must ensure that we work cost
effectively while adjusting to future challenges in the financial sector we intend to be fully operational in any eventuality in order that
we can do our part in keeping finlands financing and payment system and insurance market running and that we can ensure our
customers the services they require

megatrends risks and opportunities in the
financial sector
the financial sector is shaped by diverse megatrends which are drivers of change coming from outside the industry megatrends are
broad currents recognisable as phenomena or series of phenomena which have a recognisable direction based on past developments
and which can be expected to continue going in the same direction megatrends usually spread widely and affect the society the
economy politics the environment and technology they influence the focal points of oppohjolas strategy and csr programme and
therefore they are regularly reevaluated oppohjola updated its views on megatrends in 2013 the major megatrends in 2013 were
globalisation demographic changes digitisation economic rebalancing increased regulation and supervision and an emphasis on
sustainable development all these change trends are closely connected to csr efforts

globalisation brings societies economies and operators closer and closer to each other the financial sector is expected to display
increasing sensitivity in its reactions adaptability and international service competence the trend also emphasises the need for
responsibility in oppohjolas supply chain and international investment decisions among other functions

the demographic changes that are taking place especially in the western world arise from rising life expectancy and ageing
populations meanwhile population growth is accelerating and urbanisation continues around the world the financial sectors role in
safeguarding welfare and providing services for the elderly is becoming emphasised

digitisation is generating a diversity of information at an accelerating pace financial services must be available to customers
independently of time and place new eservices are increasingly important and new technology is harnessed for improved customer
experiences

the rebalancing of the economy requires structural reforms efforts to reduce indebtedness and improve fiscal adjustment are slowing
down economic growth in many western countries the financial and capital markets remain uncertain at the same time
international regulation and supervision of the financial sector are increasing and the sector must adjust to the new atmosphere
capital adequacy funding structures and liquidity are being reinforced increasing attention is paid to consumer protection

sustainable development is related to the major global challenges caused by scant natural resources efficient use of them and climate
change all operators are expected to act more transparently and responsibly increasing attention is paid to reputation risk also in the
financial sector meanwhile the emphasis on sustainable development is creating opportunities for responsible financial products and
services

in cooperative banks the highest decisionmaking body is the representative assembly or in the absence of such an assembly the
cooperative meeting in oppohjola the aim is for at least the largest member banks to have a representative assembly an assembly
is a more democratic alternative particularly if a bank has thousands or even tens of thousands of ownermembers

2000 representative members there were more than 5000 candidates for the posts ie over 25 times as many candidates as there
were positions there were more than 900000 ownermembers with a right to vote meaning around two thirds of all the owner
members an online election engine was in place to assist in finding the right candidate and votes could be cast online or by mail the

to the hospital

figure to 90 per cent by 2017 among the duties of the representative assembly is adoption of the banks financial statements and
balance sheet as well as election of the supervisory board which in turn elects the board of directors the representative assembly

supervisory board confirms the bylaws of the bank which deal with matters of farreaching and fundamental importance as well as
deciding on the division of duties between the managing director and board of directors the supervisory board elects the board of
directors and upon a proposal by the board of directors the managing director the board of directors is the central decisionmaking

the finance industry bears significant indirect social responsibility in line with the global compact oppohjola is committed to
promoting respect for human rights and fundamental values at work as well as environmental protection and anticorruption
activities oppohjolas ethical principles and codes of financing incorporate social and environmental responsibility which act as
yardsticks in the making of financing decisions

recognising and analysing the environmental impacts of financed projects is also important from the perspective of risk management
the likelihood of environmental risks varies depending on factors such as the project to be financed the geographical location of the
business and the sector it is crucial for the evaluation to recognise potential risks in major projects and risky sectors at oppohjola
evaluating recognised environmental risks is a part of the ordinary creditworthiness analysis besides making its own analysis the
company will when necessary require evaluations from independent experts of the environmental risks or the more extensive
corporate social responsibility of a business or project the recognised risks affect the credit decision and where applicable loan
terms

a responsible financing working group was established at oppohjola in 2012 on the groups request the loan terms applied in op
pohjolas corporate financing were revised and suggested changes were implemented in some financing agreements in 2013 the
changes emphasise the responsibility of the debtor in cases such as compliance with environmental legislation and permits applicable
to the business or with specific terms set for the case in question the changes improved the banks ability to evaluate lending
responsibility by increasing the debtors information provision obligations eg environmental reporting and by linking these to the
terms on which the loan is obtained or cancelled the group is currently evaluating to what extent it should implement the changes in
all of its loan agreements

oppohjolas corporate financing is based on longterm customer relationships with a geographical emphasis on local areas op
pohjola has considered joining the equator principles for project financing but has not done it so far due to the small number of
projects that are covered by the principles the group is closely following the development of the equator principles however and will
reconsider the matter when potential new projects arise

damages oppohjola maps potential risks and security issues together with the customer optimising insurance solutions individually

processes comprehensively and in new ways for example the new risk management method allows for security observations to be
made on a mobile basis also in 2013 pohjola presented one national and 18 regional security awards to corporate customers that
had developed security and risk management in a responsible manner within their companies with the help of an external partner in
2013 the groups insurance functions drew attention to the maintenance of electrical installations and equipment in businesses on
farms and among public bodies the identification of critical safety deficiencies in churches of high cultural and historical value

orthopaedic illnesses and injuries omasairaala has succeeded in shortening the treatment chain ie the total duration of incapacity to
work significantly ever since it started operating quick access to proper treatment and rehabilitation and swift recovery are important
not only for the patient but also for the employer and the society as a whole

another objective is to identify risks in work ability and on this basis to focus on reducing these risks and thereby increasing business
productivity omasairaala aims to provide a peerless customer experience this is measured with a net recommendation index which
can be followed in real time on the omasairaala website omasairaala strives to care for injuries as quickly as possible after an

risks and opportunities due to climate change g4ec2
as a financial sector operator oppohjola and its products and services have a relatively minor impact on climate change
environmental risks on the other hand including climate risks can have direct impacts on oppohjolas operations as well as indirect
impacts through effects on customers and stakeholders

regulations aiming to combat climate change may raise the cost of energy consumption for both oppohjola and for its
manufacturingrelated customers for whom energy prices can be a crucial element in terms of profitability and solvency it also
increases pressure on oppohjola to make energy savings in its own operations

physical site risks related to increasingly common extreme weather phenomena are particularly significant for the insurance sector
where increasing environmental risks form a part of the insurance choice and pricing models and the preventive consulting related to
site inspections extreme weather is also an operational risk included in oppohjolas own continuity planning

concerns related to climate change may pose reputation risks if any conflicts with climate change prevention efforts should be
identified in the operations of oppohjola or even those of its partners or customers on the other hand the general improvement in
environmental awareness is bringing new business opportunities for example in the form of investment products that emphasise
environmental responsibility and diverse property insurances that provide cover from the increasingly common phenomenon of
flooding when the governments flood compensation ceases as of the beginning of 2014

coverage of the organisations defined benefit plan obligations g4ec3

institute and the world business council for sustainable development the following emission sources were taken into account in line
with the division of the greenhouse gas protocol
    direct greenhouse gas emissions from the groups operations scope 1  must be included fuel consumption of emergency power
     systems and vehicles owned by the group incl vehicles of the groups leasing company
    indirect greenhouse gas emissions from consumption of electricity and heat purchased from other entities scope 2  must be

case quick help from omasairaala
the omasairaala hospital based in pikku huopalahti helsinki
delivers on its promise this is what olli rimpiläinen thinks a
man who broke his collarbone on a downhill slope

 i have suffered all kinds of minor injuries when snowboarding
compared with my previous experience of hospitals the service
provided by omasairaala is faster and smoother everything here
goes as scheduled and i have not even once had to sit and wait for
treatments says he

olli was injured during the last day of his downhill vacation in italy
immediately after the trip olli called pohjola which recommended
omasairaala specialising in orthopaedic illnesses and injuries he
could make an appointment with a doctor for tuesday and was
already on an operating table on wednesday

in addition to quick access to treatment at omasairaala all the red
tape that filing a separate claim would have required could be avoided it is also possible to deal with insurancerelated matters at the
insurerowned hospital

rimpiläinen gives omasairaala top marks for how he felt about care at the hospital

 on the whole this has been my best experience of medical care that went quickly and smoothly i have been treated properly and
professionally during every visit all the way from the appointment

omasairaala treats a lot of knee shoulder arm and wrist fractures muscle strains and ligament injuries surgery is not an end in itself
but we aim to find the right and effective treatment for every trouble and injury quick access to treatment shortens the sickness time
which means costsavings in many ways our mission differs from that of conventional clinics it is not based on the amount of
treatment and care but on the outcome this will benefit both patients employers and ultimately our society as a whole says markus
torkki chief medical officer of omasairaala

case fund saving a way to support the
protection of small rivers and lakes
opclean water fund is an equity fund that invests funds globally
in companies offering products and services in the water sector

scarcity of clean water and the challenges of water distribution
are cause for concern but they also create business opportunities
this is why the fund appeals to savers and investors alike with its
nature preservation theme and also financially explains samuli
sipilä managing director of op fund management company

in the spring of 2013 we introduced a philanthropic share class
alongside the accumulation and distribution units enabling op
pohjola group and the unitholders to jointly help protect water
resources investors in mutual funds have welcomed this warmly
and by the end of 2013 more than eur 200000 had been
invested in the philanthropic units

the underlying investments and expected return of the
philanthropic units are equivalent to normal accumulation units in the fund but the two per cent subscription fee will be donated in full
to the finnish association for nature conservation fanc the donations are used to finance projects to restore small finnish rivers
and lakes back to their natural state the subscription fees accumulated in 2013 were used to restore rivers in southern ostrobothnia
and to introduce european crayfish and sea trout into them

pirjo itkonen of fanc who coordinates cooperation with businesses explains that the donations have enabled the restoration of small
rivers and lakes to continue in ostrobothnia for example the beds of itäjoki brook in teuva and töniluoma brook in kristiinankaupunki
were worked on in september such work improves the water quality and creates environments for the endangered sea trout and for
the the european crayfish the original crayfish species in finland these are prime examples of how a relatively small investment has
achieved a lot and restored and created new habitats for valuable species the objective is to expand such restoration outside
ostrobothnia as there is plenty of need for this in other parts of the country too
