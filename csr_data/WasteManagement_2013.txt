    waste management has changed its methodology for calculating fleet efficiency to conform to the us environmental protection
    agencys current smartway truck tool we recalculated our 2007 baseline emissions using this tool as well to allow consistent
    tracking of emissions

    we have reorganized our energy use reporting function since energy use is less than 2 percent of our total direct emissions we are
    holding over our 2011 values pending implementation of a new reporting protocol
3
    we are reporting this data to inform our customers and the public about the potential ghg reduction benefits associated with carbon
    storage in landfills our renewable energy production and the recyclable materials we collect and process we are not presuming to
    characterize how emerging regulatory programs will allocate credit for these avoided emissions so we do not claim these greenhouse
    gas reduction benefits as our own nor attempt to deduct these reductions from our carbon footprint

    2012 sustainability report
