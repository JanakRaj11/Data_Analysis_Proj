ceos message

it has been 7 years ever since the first publication of the sustainability report of korea eastwest
power co ltd ewp in 2007 i believe it is a very meaningful opportunity for us to present
our economic social and environmental improvement effort and achievement for strengthening
sustainability in 2012 to all of you

as a public enterprise which produces about 116 of national electricity supply ewp has been
making an effort to sincerely follow its fundamental mission  providing inexpensive stable and
ecofriendly power supply  despite several domestic and overseas management environment
changes since the spinoff from kepco in 2001 with this we are also very proud of contributing
to the improvement of the quality of life

in 2012 ewp achieved its largest power sales ever with 54839gwh which was 73 increase
compared to 2011 due to the increased electricity demand in fact one of the causes of this
sales increase is insufficient expansion of power plants moreover this year  s power supply
situation is worse than last year and to deal with such electric power shortage ewp started
operating the new gas turbine in ulsan natural gas plant unit 4 in june 2013 which is planned
to be completed in july 2014 also dangjin power plant units 9 and 10 which will be
completed by 2016 are well being built according to their construction plans ewp also makes
an utmost effort to prevent its currently operating plants from breakdown and to operate with
maximum capacity and we operate an emergency operation system during the peak period of
power demand

in addition as a public enterprise owned by the public ewp has done various activities for
taking care of our surroundings and for fulfilling our social responsibility for example we
are currently supporting multicultural families the energy poor educational works traditional
markets and cultural events of local communities and the support range is becoming bigger
every year we have also actively participated in projects for winwin growth with smes such as
the expansion of sme product purchasing and domestic  international market development for
sme product sales

lastly ewp has performed precautional environment and safety management activities for
minimizing environmental impacts we have tried to respond to climate changes reducing ghg
emissions and developing new renewable energy sources and actively expanded the recycling
range of coal ash and waste water moreover we have built the disaster safety management
system to minimize the risk of negligent accidents that can be incurred during plant operation

                                              korea eastwest power will listen to all stakeholders
with the attitude oflimitless responsibility

      efforts to strengthen the role of bod
     ewp has improved the operating system of bod to secure the independence and professionalism of nonexecutive directors for efficient fulfillment
     of their decisionmaking ewp has established a separate homepage for the bod to improve nonexecutive directors access to managerial
     information also a system of prior deliberation for the agenda was introduced for practical deliberation of the agenda and the active reflection of
     the advices of nonexecutive directors on mid and longterm core strategies and managerial policies especially the professionalism of non
     executive directors is sufficiently utilized when making decisions on businesses with high risks so that conflicts of interest in the bod can be
     prevented through active discussions

continuing green projects to reduce ghg emissions
under the negotiated agreement for ghg emissions that came into effect in 2011
it is impossible for a company which was assigned a goal of reduction to register a new kcer project also the uncertainties in the global
carbon market is increasing including the decreases in the prices of carbon credits and the merits of cdm project have virtually disappeared
as the registration of new cdms in the eu emission trading scheme from 2013 is only applied to the poorest nations however apart from such
uncertainties ewp continues to find out the projects to reduce ghg and making efforts to fulfill its green goal successfully especially the old ulsan
heavy oil thermal power plant is being replaced with a new combined heat and power plant to reduce about 600000 ton of ghg emissions

expanding the cofiring of biomass
as a major shortterm measure to achieve the nation   s goal in reduction of ghg ewp is actively implementing cofiring of biomass a test in
donghae thermal power plant for burning in mixture with wood chip wood pallet and rdf refuse derived fuel successfully completed and the
amount of such fuels will be expanded for dangjin thermal power plant the organic solid fuel which is treated at the sewage treatment facility of
the local government and bituminous coal are used in cofiring

     rds regarding climate change
     in preparation for the increasing pressure of the international society to reduce ghg according to ipcc ewp will invest regularly on the rd related
     to cope with climate change through such investment ewp will continue to secure the high technology for the reduction of ghg especially in
     cooperation with other power generation companies ewp will concentrate its capabilities in carbon capture and storage ccs and integrated coal
     gasification combined cycle igcc that can be applied immediately to power companies for this ewp secured available lands in dangjin thermal
     power plant for ccs site and in ulsan thermal power plant for igcc site

     implementing stepbystep simulated emissions trading scheme
     ewp joined with other power generation companies and the korea power exchange on business cooperation for simulated emissions trading
     scheme to actively and jointly respond to the ipcc also according to the ewp action plan ewp for the first time as a generating company
     performed a simulated emissions trading scheme with sk group in october 2010 in 2012 ewp participated in the test trading supervised by the
     ministry of knowledge economy in preparation for the compulsory emissions trading system which will begin in 2015

     2012 goal achievement of negotiated agreement
     ewp is an enterprise ghg heavy emission and heavy energy consumption company that receives goals under the scheme of negotiated
     agreement in the negotiated agreement na the government assigns each company the goal for ghg emission and energy consumption and
     examines the performance it is a preparatory stage for the initiation of the emissions trading ewp has prepared itself to minimize risks caused by
     the execution of the system by participating in the test project of na and establishing a countermeasure prior to the system the specifications for
     ghg emissions and energy consumption between 2007 and 2012 were prepared and they were submitted to the greenhouse gas inventory 
     research center of korea in the ministry of environment after obtaining the verification of a certified verification agency in 2012 ewp emitted ghg
     of 0804 tonmwh which was lower than the goal from the government 0834 tonmwh achieving the goal

     raw material recycling
     ewp recycles such wastes as coal ash gypsum or waste oil that are produced in the process of power generation as a way for profit creation
     in addition the company is making efforts to increase recycling continuously and curtail the treatment costs by diversifying the usage of recycling continuing
     rd searching for new usage etc

     석탄회 재활용 확대
     ewp is making an effort to make a virtuous circle recycling fly ash which is produced in coalfired power plants as cement material and ewp is also
     considering a reduction and recycle plan of bottom ash for instance the technology for its complete combustion by putting it back into the boiler will
     be applied to the design of dangjin units 9 and 10 to reduce the quantity of bottom ash as a result the lifespan of the ash pond will be extended
     and the consumption of coal for fuel will be reduced meanwhile research and development for the recycling of coal ash is also expanding

   enhancement of overseas business
ewp successfully completed the test operation of nueva ventanas coalfired thermal power plant in chile in 2008 and then it has been expanding
its overseas service projects such as om of a fluidizedbed plant in cebu the philippines in 2009 us ewp rc biomass and natural gas plant
in 2010 and jamaica jps and haiti epower investment in 2011 from service businesses with dispatching operators at the beginning to the
management of overseas power plants ewp diversifies its business fields this is because of ewp  s worldclass plant constructing and managing
experience acquired from domestic power generating business specialized fluidizedbed coal power plant and wind power plant experience
systematic and specialized manpower for overseas development and broad network for overseas projects also along with such growth ewp
introduced the selfsupporting system which can analyze individual profitability with overall benefits and costs of each overseas project to
systematically manage and analyze overseas business

     on top of the previous business analysis system which simply adds up the benefits and costs of overseas projects this new system allows ewp
     to calculate overseas subsidiary profits the overall profit of overseas business including directindirect costs as well as the overall expenses and
     thus to accurately analyze the profitability based on each business  s real financial statement
