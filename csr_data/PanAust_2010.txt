tailings waste rock management
the management of waste rock was extensively reported in
the 2008 sustainability report which can be found on the
companys web site
the waste rock from the mining and processing of materials
is carefully managed to limit the potential formation of acid
the management of rock is classified based on its acid rock
drainage potential using a simple trafficlight management
plan  red amber green
all red material 4 sulphur is considered high potential
acidforming paf and is disposed of underwater in the tsf
all amber material 04  4 sulphur is considered low
paf and is encapsulated in the facility construction within
green 04 sulphur material which is considered non
acidforming naf only green material is used in general
road construction and earthworks elsewhere
the process is strictly controlled using a fleet management
system to ensure that sulphur grades are tightly managed
to meet quality control standards blending of green and
amber waste rock is used to ensure the sulphur grade in
encapsulated cells does not exceed one per cent extensive
surface and groundwater monitoring occurs below the
tsf embankment monitoring downstream from the tsf
indicates compliance with all discharge standards

celebrating world environment day
led by the united nations environment program world environment day wed has been celebrated across the globe on
5 june every year since 1973
with the aim of stimulating awareness of environmental issues and encouraging positive action the essence of wed was
brought to life through a day of action and celebration with the nam mo and nam gnone villages and schools
one of the days highlights was the planting of approximately 600 seedlings around the yards of and along roads leading to
both schools in each village providing additional cause to focus on and celebrate trees was the timing of the laos national
tree planting day  it falls annually on 1 june
wed was also used as an opportunity to discuss and plan a way forward for waste management improvements in and around
both villages discussions on the day identified the specific need for services to help people manage waste in the villages
as a result funded by the community development fund both the nam mo and nam gnone villages now have fully operating
landfill facilities and as a testament to a day of action students company staff and local people worked together to collect
and bin rubbish from around the schools and villages
with the lao national fish releasing day falling on 13 july of each year it was also a timely opportunity for the company to
agree to releasing 500000 fingerlings small fish into the local waterways on 13 july 2010
the day also saw school students and villagers participating in an environmental knowledge competition at least 80
participants received prizes including wed tshirts
phu bia mining sustainability department staff nam mo and nam gnone village schools and the village development
committee together planned and hosted the event
while very much a communitybased grassroots event wed in the nam mo and nam gnone villages was a day of many
important environmental milestones and actions it also typified the way in which the company builds capacity within the
community  by engaging consulting and encouraging participation in decisionmaking to empower local people to take
ownership of community issues
last year i was participating in world environment day organised in the school the event provided a good opportunity for
students and villagers to deepen their understanding about the environment you can see now several trees around the school
are growing up im very much looking forward to the wed this year miss chanthone nam mo secondary school student
world environment day was a very good event for the villagers to come together and do something for our environment
it gave us a chance to discuss any environmental issues that we were facing last year waste management in the village was
addressed many places were not as tidy as they should be from there we started to work with phu bia mining to focus
on this issue and finally we have two landfill facilities operating in both villages mr sonexay nam mo village development

the livelihood improvement program
aligning with the lao governments poverty reduction policies the livelihood improvement program was set up to lift the
longterm livelihood prospects for people living around the phu kham coppergold operation without them having
to become employees of the mine
by early 2010 150 people  98 per cent of whom were women  had established a viable marketgarden or fishfarming
business to help meet the demand for fresh produce at the phu kham operation
one such small business person is ms joom a 44year old mother of two and resident of nam mo in late 2009
ms joom became a participant in the livelihood improvement program and by early 2010 had her own flourishing
mushroomgrowing business
ms joom acquired the necessary skills to become a mushroom marketgardener by attending the agricultural and small
business training sessions she formed a group with five others to take out a million kip loan for a threemonth term at the
interest rate of two per cent giving her the purchasing power to buy mushroom spore and setup materials for her business
within three weeks of set up ms joom had grown and sold 25 kilograms of mushrooms earning close to 500000 kip from
her first sale at a market price of around 20000 kip per kilogram  a fantastic result
ms joom said she was very grateful for the training as well as the work the company has done with the lao womens union
to provide access to finance she is hopeful that the combination of upskilling and affordable credit will give other people
from both nam gnone and nam mo the opportunity to improve their standard of living
