introduction
responsibility freedom and pride

dear reader

2010 was again a demanding year for tnt during which we faced significant challenges in both the economic and
natural environments as the economic recovery encouraged global trade our express volumes improved
significantly however this volume growth put pressure on our yield especially in europe our primary market in
response we implemented a comprehensive programme to increase prices and launch new surcharges while
ensuring balanced growth between client and product segments

extreme environmental conditions also challenged our business our operations were impacted by heavy snowfall
in the first and last months of 2010 and the closure of the european airspace following the eruption of the icelandic
volcano eyjafjallaj√∂kull despite these difficult circumstances we successfully rerouted many deliveries to meet
customers expectations

in the emerging platforms we continued to upgrade and integrate our acquisitions into our global express network
and establish new intercontinental connections these intercontinental connections will fuel the growth of the local
networks both in europe and in the emerging platforms

pole position for growth

with our focused growth in parcels freight valueadded services and emerging platforms express is optimally
positioned to grow with our customers and meet their need for a true global integrator our target to grow from
7 billion to 10 billion revenue by 2015 is a manifestation of our customers needs as our customers supply
chains become more and more complex and interconnected they require a proactive partner to meet logistical
challenges be it in express parcels freight or valueadded services with our strong regional networks in europe
south america and asia our dedicated intercontinental airline hauls and  last but not least  our brand and our
people we are exceptionally well placed to connect demand with supply across the globe and answer the need for
speed quality and service

we will continue to develop businesstoconsumer delivery services to leverage the developments in ecommerce
in addition we will continue to expand our activities in china india and south america and extend our regional
networks particularly in the middle east and asia

independent company

the managerial separation of express and mail became effective in january 2011 and we have a new highly
experienced leadership team in place following the approval of the separation by the annual general meeting of
shareholders planned for 25 may 2011 express will be a totally independent entity we look forward to
continuing to lead our customers into new areas of growth leveraging our strengths as a separate company

to me independence brings responsibility freedom and pride more than ever we feel the responsibility to deliver
sustainable profitable growth most of all independence means freedom freedom to focus on the priorities of the
express business and to anticipate our customers requirements as an independent company we can engage in
direct dialogue with all our stakeholders to share our vision and strategic priorities we also have more freedom
to provide optimal support for pl responsible express entrepreneurs worldwide as the line of sight between
express strategy and their daytoday operations becomes more direct

by taking up the challenge of freedom and responsibility we will continue to instil pride in our people this will be
driven by our highly satisfied customers exceptionally engaged colleagues and a strong experienced global
management team our refined strategy and performance culture will make us a valuable investment in our
shareholders portfolios

looking ahead to 2011
in 2011 we expect to see the results of our yield improvement programme in our bottom line alongside this
programmes to leverage our brand and networks in parcels and freight are also delivering positive outcomes we


                                                                                                                         5

            2010 tnt express

market today we at express from the netherlands to china together with the full management board are
determined to deliver upon the promise of independence a promise of responsibility freedom and pride for all our
stakeholders

express of 299 subject to shareholder approval the minority financial shareholding in express is necessary to
meet separation requirements

in tnt nv depending on the equity position any excess capital will be returned to shareholders the retained
minority shareholding will have no special governance or voting rights for further details on the separation please
refer to the 2010 annual report of tnt nv

the demerger will be effective by the end of may 2011 following shareholder approval as of january 2011 the

overall air capacity in 2010 increased compared with 2009 as a result of the increased volumes both in europe
and on the asia to europe route express increased its capacity mainly through leased and chartered aircraft
providing further flexibility to the network more than half of the increase in capacity was as a result of the
dedicated longhaul airplanes between china and europe which replaced capacity that in the past would have been
purchased from other airlines

chapter 2 market overview trends
strategy and outlook
express is part of the global transportation and distribution industry and is dedicated to providing delivery solutions
to its customers

market overview
general
express operates in what is commonly referred to as the cep market courierexpressparcels which is usually
segmented along two dimensions speed or timecertainty and weight within the first dimension customers have
different requirements in terms of speed and guarantees for their consignments ranging from sameday and time
definite to dayuncertain deliveries within the second dimension the weight shapes and sizes of consignments
differ they range from small and light goods eg documents to large and heavy goods

these varied requirements use different delivery networks and are served by different operators see graphic
below these range from expeditious and timesensitive air and road express networks operated by integrators
to less expedited sea carriers freight forwarders operate networks that are partially virtual using block space on
other operators planes ships and to a lesser extent trucks and their own depots and sites in harbours and at
airports couriers focus on sameday and intercontinental nextday deliveries with a focus on light weights

express is a socalled integrator covering most of the market segments excluding mail services and transport of
bulk goods see graphic below the other global integrators are ups fedex and dhl

market trends
express has identified four key market trends that will impact its activities

blurring boundaries between the various segments of the transportation industry
service providers are increasingly expanding the range of services they offer for example operators who
previously provided services without guaranteed delivery time or date are upgrading their service levels

increasing importance and accelerated growth of emerging markets
the growth of international trade and globalisation of supply chains continues emerging markets have an increasing
importance in global trade flows and have rapidly developing domestic markets

growing importance of ecommerce and the resulting growth in the businesstoconsumer b2c market
the ongoing digitisation of the economy impacts the mode of sales of express services to ad hoc and small
customers and the increase in online sales and home deliveries has led to strong growth in b2c parcels online
shopping and online retail

increasing awareness and interest in sustainable business practices
stakeholdersustainability demands are increasingly shaping the market and therefore business success in line with
this carbon emissions and employee health and safety are key responsibilities for express

express business strategy

customers are the core of the express strategy the express network and footprint has evolved with customer
needs to optimise supply chains as such express developed a strong and agile express platform in europe for
timedefinite and daydefinite delivery services in parcels and freight when its customers started moving
production to lowcost countries express expanded its intercontinental networks accordingly with growing
demand in the emerging economies of asia and south america express has established highquality local networks
this has resulted in a global interconnected system of local networks giving customers the broadest market
coverage express will continue to keep customers at the core of its strategy by providing solutions to deliver
their business in the optimal way

express strategy is twofold
 to strengthen existing business with a focus on service quality and cost efficiency in its operation and expansion
   of its connected strong networks and
 to unlock value from the identified market trends translated into growth opportunities centred on parcels
   freight valueadded services and emerging platforms

express is well positioned to strengthen its existing business and to capture these growth opportunities due to its
unique capabilities knowledge and experience through
 its ability to connect local networks in a global system


                                                                                                                       12

parcels
the growth of ecommerce and customer demand offers opportunities for express in the b2c market express
has successfully launched a highend parcel service to capitalise on the growing ecommercehome delivery market
the service offers a comprehensive solution including text messaging or email notification to customers and the
opportunity for receivers to arrange for delivery to their preferred location this service has led to a reduction in
not at home deliveries from 20 to 10 building on this achievement the aim is to grow further in this segment
both domestically and internationally express has a small but growing share of around 5 in the european highend
express b2c segment

express is also targeting expansion in the standard parcels b2c segment the announced partnership with adrexo
colis is a first step in this expansion with potential for duplication in other european markets

in the b2b parcels market one of the key growth opportunities for express is in crossborder parcels cross
border parcels offer an opportunity to gain a larger share of customers looking for a tailored lower cost parcels
solution through dedicated direct connections for large customers express will be able to reduce handling and
transport costs

existing large customers express is expanding to nonexpress services by offering a highend road freight service
this will allow express to manage the entire flow of customers although only representing a small share of the
total nonexpress freight market estimated at 85 billion the absolute potential of the highend road freight
segment is significant express will target the europeanwide flows of large customers that deliver scheduled
palletised and consolidated industrial freight services are planned to be provided in an assetlight set up using
existing linehaul capacity in current express networks for example empty backhaul existing subcontracting
pool and by leveraging on internal capabilities such as backoffice and procurement the road freight demand of
express current top 25 customers is estimated at around 12 billion which is confirmation of the potential of this
proposition

valueadded services
express differentiates itself by combining express and valueadded services vas developed to meet the needs of
customers in specific vertical markets express brings strong customer focus and sectorspecific knowledge to
these markets price competitiveness is achieved by complementing existing networks with special delivery or last
mile networks where needed

priority industries include hightech healthcare industrial automotive and life style express services focus on
outbound flows and the rapidly growing aftersales market currently express already transports more than 100
million mobile phones laptops tablets and smart phones for its global hightech customers often directly from
original equipment manufacturers oems in china to warehouses distribution centres and endcustomers in
europe via its european network in healthcare express is expanding its position in clinical trials shipments two
million items handled and hospital delivery solutions leveraging the existing 500 forwardstock locations and
leading positions in key countries in the innight segment will allow further growth in hightech healthcare
automotive and industrial verticals

emerging platforms
express continues to build on an advantageous position in emerging markets with a specific focus on china south
america and india where it operates dense local and regional networks these emerging market positions also
support express intercontinental air connections to europe

the express network in china is evolving along with its customers as was aptly demonstrated by express response
to the move in 2010 of hightech production facilities from southern china to the west of the country tnt
airways was able to secure landing rights in the western city of chongqing for its aircraft and in doing so
established a competitive advantage by being the first express player to fly into this important area and to serve
what is set to be a major centre for the hightech manufacturing industry in china in the coming years similarly
express domestic daycertain road delivery service plays into the needs of key multinational accounts as well as
local customers growing demand for reliable intrachina deliveries hoaus daycertain network aims to connect
1100 depots in china out of a total of 1500 by mid2011

in india the integration of the domestic road and express company speedage into express existing indian
operations supports the ambition to create a leading position in india through strengthening its road network and
increasing the delivery quality in its domestic service offering express aims to seize the opportunity of strong
growth in domestic demand a new potential driver of growth in the indian market is the anticipated change in
gstvat regulation it is expected that this change will provide a boost to investment and economic growth and
will give customers the ability to drastically reengineer their supply chain and footprint requirements thereby
creating opportunities especially in domestic valueadded services with regard to international flows express
plans to increase penetration and expand its market position on europe and asia routes

in the past four years express has established a leadership position in the attractive fastgrowing south american
emerging markets express plans to expand these activities in the coming years in line with the growing and
changing needs of its customers express aims to continue its significant industry innovation in south america
automated hubs and sophisticated labelling systems are being implemented in all the major depots and hubs which

 cash pooling systems facilitating optimised cash requirements for the express group by enabling centralised
   funding and surplus cash concentration at group level and
 a tax optimal internal and external funding focused at optimising the cost of capital for the express group
   within long term sustainable boundaries

express has set target credit ratings of bbb for standard  poors ratings services sp and baa1 for moodys

express will monitor the development of the key credit ratios that are used by rating agents and which may vary
from time to time

express aims to meet shareholders return requirements long term through growth in the value of the company
and short term through dividends and incidentally through tax exempt share repurchases or other returns from
excess cash

chapter 3 change in format presentation
and scope of results
following the completion of the announced internal legal restructuring on 1 january 2011 the full legal scope of
the express entities to be demerged as well as the legal scope of the remaining tnt nv mail group after
demerger have been defined accounting standards require tnt nv to publish its full year 2010 results and
subsequent reports anticipating the demerger of express

as a result the express entities to be demerged are presented in a single line in the income statement and balance
sheet in order to provide additional insight into the strategy business performance financial position and other
topics relevant to express this supplementary report has been prepared

the most notable differences between the new reporting structure and former segment reporting of tnt are the
following

difference in scope express and mail other networks in addition to certain centrallymanaged entities
included in nonallocated will be included in the scope of the demerged express entity the remaining centrally
managed entities including tnt nv will be included in the scope of the remaining mail entity the actual
revenues and costs incurred by this changed scope differ from that reported under the previous segment
reporting which was aligned with divisional management responsibilities

temporary adjustment  profit pooling arrangement previously a profit pooling arrangement was in place
whereby express legal entities absorbed the fiscal losses of mail given that the new reporting structure is on a
legal entity basis these losses are reflected in express operating income in 2010 and in the adjusted figures for
2009 in anticipation of the demerger the profit pooling arrangement was terminated on 30 november 2010

temporary differences  defined benefit pension expense and actual payable pension contributions
as disclosed previously in tnt nvs annual reports for segment reporting purposes the total defined benefit
pension cost for the dutch pension plans was allocated to the units on the basis of the total pensionable salary of
the employees concerned for statutory purposes however the relevant entities recognise the cost equal to the
contributions payable for the period in their financial statement ias 1934a tnt nv the sponsor for such
plans recognises the contributions received from the relevant group companies as a benefit that offsets the
defined benefit pension expense as a consequence tnt nv will show a net benefit given that the contributions
received are higher than the defined benefit pension expense the results of the express entities to be demerged
will show the higher pension cost based on the contributions paid however following the demerger the new
express entity will no longer qualify as a tnt group entity and will only report defined benefit pension expenses in
its income statement

as a result of the differences explained above the operating income under the previous segment reporting differs

the number of consignments and kilogrammes transported through express networks which is strongly correlated with the
macroeconomic environment gdp growth and trade volumes and by the number of working days in a year

the upward trend experienced in the global economy late 2009 continued in 2010 with an estimated global gdp
growth of around 4 gdp information source eiu in europe the growth in the economy accelerated during
the second quarter resulting in a real gdp growth of around 22 for the full year driven by a strong increase in
industrial production however growth in southern countries was clearly weaker eg italy 11 spain 02
growth in asiapacific economies was robust with chinas growth accelerating to 10 due to strong
performance in all sectors of the economy with the exception of exports india also grew strongly with real gdp
growth of around 88 growth in the emerging american countries was 74 on average with the brazilian
economy growing by 75

the mix of domestic and international express and economy express services express provides to its customers and the
customer mix

in the economic recession express saw a shift from its express services to economy express services as during the
economic downturn customers sought to control costs

the customer mix is the proportion of each of the customer categories eg small and medium enterprises major
customers and global customers the optimal combination of customers results in the highest margin given the
available network capacity

the price levels including surcharges express obtains for its services
express has different rates per service origindestination lane weight band volume and size and applies various
surcharges among others related to fuel

given the nature of its business fuel is an important component of express operating costs especially for
international air lifted services brent crude oil prices traded in a range of 70  94barrel source us energy
information administration with a constant increase in prices as of early summer 2010 to a level above 90 at the
end of 2010 express seeks to recover the increase in fuel costs through a fuel surcharge linked to the brent crude
price there is typically a two month lag between changes in fuel price and the corresponding adjustment of the
fuel surcharge therefore the increase in the fuel cost in the fourth quarter was not fully recovered in 2010

ongoing restructuring actions to further optimise the efficiency of its network and the positive impact of previous years
restructuring

against the backdrop of an improving but still uncertain business environment in 2010 express continued its focus
on costs and cash as volumes increased yield remained negative express focused on implementation of yield
measures such as improved customer and product mix general price increase in europe of on average 35 for
customers on standardized tariffs contractspecific price increases and surcharges cost per consignment
continued to decline despite inflationary pressure as a result of the wide range of global and local cost saving
programmes

currency developments impacting the translation of the companys results outside the euro zone

express operates on an international basis generating foreign currency exchange risks arising from future
commercial transactions recognised assets and liabilities investments and divestments in foreign currencies other
than the euro express functional and reporting currency the companys treasury department matches and
manages the intragroup and external financial exposures although the company generally enters into hedging
arrangements and other contracts in order to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations these measures may be
inadequate or may subject the company to increased operating or financing costs the main two currencies of
express external hedges are the british pound and us dollar management has set up a policy to require group
companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against the functional and reporting currency

note growth in average daily kilogrammes carried by the european air network and by the european road network

international growth was absorbed by adding additional road and air capacity to the network

domestic volumes grew albeit at a lower rate than international in europe domestic consignments grew by 64
outperforming european gdp growth in 2010 compared to 2009 in asiapacific express experienced strong
domestic revenue growth particularly in australia and india hoau china focused on replacing lower yielding
domestic volumes with the new daydefinite product offering which grew more than five times compared to 2009
in americas primarily brazil domestic volumes were down as a result of yield actions and contract
rationalisation

revenuequality
while overall volumes grew faster than anticipated for both domestic and international pressure on revenue
quality in 2010 remained significant compared to both 2009 and the benchmark year 2007 the decline in
revenuequality stabilised throughout 2010 although the yield was still behind the level of 2009 customer mix was
a key reason for this development with stronger growth in global and major accounts trading at previously agreed
contract rates several yieldimprovement measures were rolled out in july 2010 these included targets for
improving express product and customer mix increases in standardised tariffs contractspecific increases and

broader application of surcharges however given the lead time for these measures the full effect will be felt in
2011 the yield dropped in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter due to the adverse weather conditions in
europe in december which had a larger impact on the international higher yielding product than on domestic
products

note revenuequality is the average of the growth in revenue per consignment and revenue per kilo for the domestic and international
products excluding acquisitions

network performance optimisation
in 2010 cost per consignment continued to decrease despite inflationary pressure due to a wide range of cost
saving programmes in the areas of procurement network and operations optimisation coupled with an overall cost
focus

cost per consignment excluding fuel oneoff costs relating to operation restructuring and foreign exchange
charges in europe  mea was 26 lower than in 2009 cost per consignment in aspac was 33 higher and in
americas was 114 higher due to significantly higher inflation pressure and higher average weights more than
offset on the revenue side by higher yields

in the european air network express increased capacity while achieving its highest cargo load factor in recent
history the additional capacity was primarily addressed through additional chartered aircraft which permitted
greater capacity flexibility

in light of intercontinental volume growth express added another two dedicated boeing 747 freighters from its
liege hub to hong kong and shanghai in october express introduced a direct scheduled boeing 747 service
between chongqing a fastgrowing hightech manufacturing centre in central china and europe express is the
first express integrator to offer dedicated flights between europe and chongqing in response to growing demand
from the regions hightech industry express also announced the lease and delivery of three new boeing 777 long
range freighters to commence service in 2011 the boeing 777 freighters will replace the two boeing 747
freighters currently on short term lease and add capacity to express longhaul routes mainly between europe and
china

express continued its rollout of company wide common information and communication systems in 2010
which over time are expected to lead to both improved processes and cost savings once the legacy systems have
been decommissioned

express took measures to streamline its organisation and align it with the new management structure announced
on 2 december 2010 this realignment and several country specific reorganisations resulted in oneoff
restructuring charges of around 16 million

in 2010 express revenues grew by 136 to 7053 million express operating income as percentage of revenue
increased from 10 in 2009 to 26 in 2010

revenue growth was mainly due to the economic recovery leading to increased volumes within express which
resulted in higher operating revenues predominantly from organic growth of 450 million including 83 million
higher fuel surcharge revenue furthermore operating revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency
exchange differences of 350 million mainly due to the depreciation of the euro against the australian dollar
brazilian real and various asian currencies and the fullyear impact of acquisitions lit cargo in february 2009 and
expresso ara√ßatuba in may 2009 of 45 million higher volumes compared to 2009 contributed to organic
revenue growth partly offset by lower revenuequality

underlying operating income please refer to the paragraph on underlying development 2010 and 2009 on page
25 was 338 million or 41 higher than 2009 32 at constant foreign exchange rates higher volumes and the
continuous reduction of express cost per consignment or kilogramme had a positive impact on the operating
income development lower revenuequality higher cost of commercial linehaul negative contribution of the
brazilian operations adverse weather conditions in december and increased security costs all impacted operating
income negatively restructuring costs and impairment charges decreased compared to 2009 express maintained
its focus on optimising its network with the continuation of various efficiency improvement initiatives

express 2010 performance can be explained further in the context of the following specific events

 express operations in europe were negatively impacted by exceptionally adverse weather conditions in
  december express liege hub was closed for two days with extensive disruptions to service and deliveries
  across europe express european road hub in arnhem and road linehauls were also significantly impacted due
  to temporary road closures for trucks the estimated negative impact on operating income was 15 million
 brazil experienced significant margin pressure due to a number of factors including planned investment in
  transforming business processes and a statutory 75 wage increase in addition brazil had to absorb around
  20 million of additional integrationrelated costs due to claims and provisions new systems and processes are
  being implemented in 2011 these are expected to improve efficiency and service level to customers and
  enhance administrative processes and controls
 heightened security requirements addressing the threat of bombparcels led to the implementation of
  additional security measures reinforcing ground and air security controls covering express own operation and
  that of its associates subcontractors and partner airlines the additional incurred costs are expected to be
  recovered from customers through an enhanced security surcharge introduced at the beginning of december
  2010

other income increased to 12 million 2009 0 and consists mainly of the book profit of the sale of real estate
and aircraft

to 6885 million in 2010 operating expenses increased by 408 million 66 if excluding foreign currency
exchange impact of 330 million the increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher work contracted
out and other external expenses driven by increased volumes and an increase in fuel costs of 83 million as well as
significant oneoff costs related to the demerger of 45 million

as a result operating income in express increased by 119 million or 1951 in 2010 compared to 2009

compared to 2009 the profit for the period increased by 77 million largely due to increased revenues and lower

the 2010 underlying operating income amounts to 338 million 2009 240 underlying operating income
excludes some nonrecurring items such as restructuring related charges of 16 million 2009 37 impact of 20

million demerger related costs of 45 million 2009 0 the impact of the profit pooling arrangement of 41
million 2009 92 pension charges of 25 million 2009 24 and various other items of 4 million 2009 4

in 2010 express recorded nonrecurring restructuring charges of 16 million mainly related to restructuring
programmes in the americas of 8 million and europe  mea of 8 million

express operations in europe were negatively impacted by exceptionally adverse weather conditions in december
notably express liege hub was closed for two days with extensive disruptions to service this led to an
estimated negative impact on express results of 15 million

tnt head office bv is included in express and is the contractual entity for the majority of the services and
support related to the demerger the total demerger cost incurred amounted to 45 million in 2010

in the past years a profit pooling arrangement was in place whereby express legal entities absorbed the fiscal
losses of mail international operations in germany given that the new reporting structure is on a legal entity basis
these losses are reflected in express operating income in 2010 in anticipation of the demerger the profit pooling
arrangement was terminated at 30 november 2010

in 2010 express contributed cash pension contribution towards tnt nv for its dutch group pension plans
after the demerger the current group pension plan definition in accordance with ias 1934a will no longer be valid
as a result of which both entities mail and express will account for their defined benefit pension costs separately
the underlying cost adjustment represents the difference between the ifrs expense and the cash contribution paid
by express to tnt nv

the various other items in 2010 consist of a 2 million book gain on the sale of an aircraft and a 2 million
impairment reversal on aircraft that will be put back into operation in 2011

in 2009 operating income was also impacted by impairments and other value adjustments mainly include a 10
million impairment charge related to impaired customer relationships and an impairment on vehicles of 5 million

2010 the current tax expense amounted to 88 million 2009 62 the difference between the total income
taxes in the income statement and the current tax expense is due to timing differences these differences are
recognised as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities

in 2010 the effective income tax rate was 452 and is significantly higher than the statutory corporate income tax
rate of 255 in the netherlands the effective income tax rate was impacted by nondeductible costs and current
year losses for which no deferred tax assets could be recognised due to uncertainty regarding the recoverability of
such assets partly offset by positive effects from several optimisation projects

profit before income taxes adjusted for noncash items 19 million from change in provisions and 159 million

a result of higher revenue and related increase in trade receivables in 2010

overall net cash from operating activities decreased by 75 million from 316 million in 2009 to 241 million in
2010 which is primarily due to significantly higher tax payments in several countries in 2010 and lower cash
generated from operations as described above

notes to the combined financial statements
general information and description of the business
as part of its vision 2015 strategy tnt nv hereafter referred to as tnt announced on 2 december 2010
that the express business would be demerged from tnt nv and that consequently tnt nv would only
comprise of mail activities with the demerger tnt aims to realise two strong independently listed companies
both the board of management and the supervisory board of tnt have approved all required decisions for the
proposed demerger the main reasons for separation are the increasingly divergent strategic profiles of the two
units and the limited synergies existing between them mail is faced with a continuously declining mail market in the
netherlands and has to focus on sustaining solid cash flows and operational efficiency the priorities for express
are to grow its existing strong european networks continue to grow the intercontinental business from and to
europe into adjacent markets and to secure contributions from its existing strong positions in china south
america and india separation will enable greater internal focus on each business with singlebusiness investment
discipline and capital allocation and leaner more flexible organisations tnt nv will retain a 299 minority
financial shareholding in express

this demerger will be proposed to the shareholders of tnt during the annual meeting of shareholders on 25 may
2011 the demerger will be effective pending shareholder approval

as a consequence the former express division of tnt nv and relating entities that are part of the demerger are
reported as discontinued operationsassets held for demerger in the financial statements of tnt nv in order to
provide additional insight into the performance and financial position of the express business hereafter referred to
as express or the company combined financial statements of express have been prepared for the financial year
2010 with comparative figures for the financial year 2009

the combined financial statements have been authorised for issue by tnts board of management and supervisory
board on 21 february 2011

following the internal restructuring conducted throughout 2010 express legal entities that are assigned to express
have been contributed in kind and as a result are legally owned by express holdco bv as at 31 december 2010

in the proposed demerger tnt nv intends to demerge to its whollyowned subsidiary tnt express listco nv
a 701 stake in its whollyowned subsidiary tnt express holdco bv which directly or indirectly owns 100 of
the express subsidiaries and activities
at the same time tnt nv will also demerge 100 of its shares in tnt express listco nv which shares will
automatically be cancelled as a result of the demerger consequently tnt nv will not hold an interest in tnt
express listco nv anymore

tnt express listco nv will allot new shares to the shareholders of tnt nv in a 11 ratio

the demerger is followed by a merger whereby tnt express holdco bv merges into tnt express listco nv
and ceases to exist in exchange tnt express listco nv will allot new shares to tnt nv and thereafter tnt
nv will hold a 299 interest in tnt express listco nv

in addition to achieve the desired leverage structure an intercompany receivable of tnt nv on tnt mail
holding bv a wholly owned subsidiary of tnt nv will be demerged to express

the basis of preparation combination and preparation of the combined financial statements of express is more
fully described below

basis of preparation
express provides doortodoor express delivery services for customers sending documents parcels freight and
special services worldwide with a focus on timecertain andor daycertain pickup and delivery the main sectors
express services are high tech automotive industrial healthcare and lifestyle express is structured per geography
and function

express has prepared these combined financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting
standards ifrs as adopted by the european union eu these combined financial statements are the first


                                                                                                                        36

            2010 tnt express

section a general
chapter 5 financial statements continued
financial statements prepared for express the company has elected to not apply ifrs 1 firsttime adoption of
international financial reporting standards but to apply the same accounting policies as those applied in the
historical reporting of financial information to tnt nv

in preparing these combined financial statements the financial information of the legal entities within express has
been extracted from the reporting records on a legal entity basis which have been reported for group
consolidation purposes within tnt nv the accounting policies in the historical combined financial statements for
express are consistent with the accounting policies applied in tnts consolidated financial statements which
comply with ifrs as adopted by the eu as a result the combined financial statements are based on predecessor
values and will include all entities that are within reporting entity scope of express holdco bv

the combined financial statements have not been prepared under part 9 of book 2 of the netherlands civil code
they have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with ifrs except for certain financial
instruments which are measured at fair value and may not be indicative of the actual results of operations and
financial position of express had it operated as a separate entity

the combined financial statements have been prepared on a carveout basis from the tnt nv consolidated
financial statements for the purposes of presenting the financial position results of operations and cash flows of
express on a standalone basis the combined financial statements of express reflect assets liabilities revenues and
expenses directly attributable to express including management fee allocations recognised on a historical basis in
the accounting records of tnt on a legal entity basis although it is not possible to estimate the actual costs that
would have been incurred if the services performed by tnt had been purchased from independent third parties
the allocations are considered to be reasonable by the directors of tnt and management of express however
the financial position results of operations and cash flows of express are not necessarily representative or
indicative of those that would have been achieved had express operated autonomously or as an entity independent
from tnt

basis of combination
in determining the entities to be included in the combined financial statements management considered those
entities that have been managed as part of express on a historical basis

currently the legal entities of the express business are held by express holdco bv following the internal
restructuring that was finalised late end december 2010 as a result the financial statements have not been
prepared by consolidating the current ultimate parent express holdco bv and its subsidiaries for the financial
years 2009 and 2010 instead the financial statements have been prepared by combining all individual subsidiaries
into one reporting entity express holdco bv the list of individual legal entities included within these combined
financial statements which together form the express business is provided in note 36 these entities have been
classified as subsidiary associate or joint venture undertakings as described below and all intraexpress
transactions balances income and expenses including unrealised profits on such transactions have been
eliminated on combination unrealised losses have also been eliminated unless the transaction provided evidence of
an impairment of the asset transferred

net investment
the net investment by other tnt companies includes the aggregated combined share capital of the entities
included within the combined financial statements capital contributions and reductions dividend payments and
other movements relating to tnt investments not managed as part of the express business accumulated results
cumulative translation adjustments and cash flow hedging

management fee
tnt uses a cost recovery mechanism to recover certain central management and other similar costs it incurs at a
corporate level the management fees reflected in the combined financial statements are based on the amounts
historically due and have been recorded in the accounts of the individual legal entities within express under the
contractual cost recovery mechanism an appropriate proportion of the remuneration of personnel for tnt and
express including their salaries and pension costs is included in these management fees these management fees
have either been directly attributed to individual operations of express or for costs incurred centrally allocated
between the relevant tnt businesses and express operations on arms length basis a complete discussion of the
relationship express has with tnt and other tnt entities including a description of the costs that have
historically been charged to express is included in note 33 to these combined financial statements




                                                                                                                         37

chapter 5 financial statements continued
pension and post retirement costs
express operates a number of pension plans around the world which include defined benefit plans in the
netherlands united kingdom germany italy and australia the dutch pension plans are funded defined benefit
plans covered by pension funds externally funded in stichting pensioenfonds tnt and stichting
ondernemingspensioenfonds tnt tnt nv is the sponsoring employer for these two dutch pension plans and
consequently these pension plans qualify as group plans for express in accordance with ias 1934a due to their
qualification as group plans express recognises in the combined financial statement a cost equal to the
contribution payable for the period

interest
the interest charge reflected in the combined financial statements is based on the interest charge historically
incurred by the entities included in express on specific external borrowings or financing provided by other tnt
companies details of specific external borrowings and borrowings held with other tnt companies are set out in
notes 12 and 13

taxation
the tax charge attributable to express is based on the tax charge attributable to the individual entity or group of
tnt entities in the relevant individual tax jurisdictions on a separate return basis tax liabilities that may arise
from any separation from tnt tax groups of the operations of express in specific countries have not been
reflected in these combined financial statements

goodwill
goodwill recorded at a consolidated tnt level and attributable to express as a result of previous business
combinations with parties outside of the tnt group of companies has been recorded in these combined financial
statements

sharebased payments
a number of express employees participate in tnts performance share schemes for purposes of these combined
financial statements transfers of tnts equity instruments to employees of express have been reflected as equity
settled sharebased payment transactions

the principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these combined financial statements are set out
below these policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated all
amounts included in the financial statements are presented in euro unless otherwise stated

summary of significant accounting policies
functional currency and presentation currency
items included in the financial statements of all express entities are measured using the currency of the primary
environment in which the entity operates the functional currency the combined financial statements are
presented in euros which is the functional and presentation currency of express

foreign currency transactions and balances
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the
date of the transactions monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated to the functional
currency using yearend exchange rates

foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and
balances and from the translation at yearend exchange rates are recognised in the income statement except for
qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges that are directly recognised in equity

foreign operations
the results and financial position of all express entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary
economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the
presentation currency as follows
 assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate
 income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates and
 the resulting exchange differences based on the different ways of translation between the balance sheet and the
   income statement are recognised as a separate component of equity translation reserve



                                                                                                                        38

            2010 tnt express

section a general
chapter 5 financial statements continued
foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities and of
borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments are taken to the translation
reserve when a foreign operation is sold such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as
part of the gain or loss on the sale

goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing exchange rate

subsidiaries associates and joint ventures

subsidiaries are all entities including special purpose entities over which express has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights
the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered
when assessing whether express controls another entity

an associate is an entity that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture over which commercial and
financial policy decisions express has the power to exert significant influence significant influence is the power to
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but is not control or joint control over those
policies express share of results of all significant associates is included in the combined financial statements of
income using the equity method the carrying value of express share in associates includes goodwill on acquisition
and includes changes to reflect express share in net earnings of the respective companies reduced by dividends
received express share in nondistributed earnings of associates is included in net investment when express
share of any accumulated losses exceeds the acquisition value of the shares in the associates the book value is
reduced to zero and the reporting of losses ceases unless express is bound by guarantees or other undertakings in
relation to the associate

a joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby express and one or more parties undertake an economic
activity that is subject to joint control joint ventures in which express participates with other parties are
proportionately combined in applying the proportionate combination method express percentage share of the
balance sheet and income statement items are included in express combined financial statements

business combinations
express uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries the consideration
of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred equity instruments issued and liabilities
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange the consideration transferred includes also the fair value arising from
contingent consideration arrangements acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair
values at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest

the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of express share of the identifiable net assets of the
subsidiary is recorded as goodwill if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of express share of the net
assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised directly in the income statement

express treats transactions with noncontrolling interests as transactions with equity owners for purchases from
noncontrolling interests the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the
carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity gains or losses on disposals to noncontrolling
interests are also recorded in equity

when express ceases to have control or significant influence any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to
its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss the fair value is the initial carrying
amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate joint venture or
financial asset in addition any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that
entity are accounted for as if express had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities this may mean that
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss

the noncontrolling interest is initially measured at the proportion of the noncontrolling interest in the recognized
net fair value of the assets liabilities and contingent liabilities losses applicable to the noncontrolling in excess of
the noncontrolling interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against express interests except to the extent
that the noncontrolling interest has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the
losses subsidiaries accounting policies have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with express
accounting policies


                                                                                                                              39

            2010 tnt express

section a general
chapter 5 financial statements continued

express applied the new policies as described above prospectively to transactions occurring on or after 1 january
2010 prior to 1 january 2010 the cost of an acquisition was measured as the fair value of the assets given equity
instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange plus costs directly attributable to the
acquisition identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination
were measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling
interest transactions with noncontrolling interests were treated as transactions with external parties disposals
therefore resulted in gains or losses in profit or loss and purchases resulted in the recognition of goodwill on
disposal or partial disposal a proportionate interest in reserves attributable to the subsidiary was reclassified to
profit or loss or directly to retained earnings when the group ceased to have control or significant influence over
an entity the carrying amount of the investment at the date control or significant influence became its cost for the
purposes of subsequent accounting

intangible assets
goodwill
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the share of the identifiable net
assets acquired by express goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and joint ventures is included in intangible
assets goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates

goodwill is recognised as an asset and although it is not amortised it is reviewed for impairment annually and
whenever there is a possible indicator of impairment any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss
and is not subsequently reversed goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses on disposal of an
entity any residual amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal

goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to ifrs has been retained at the previous historic
values as no adjustment was required on transition these have also been subject to impairment tests at that date
and will continue to be at least annually

other intangible assets
costs related to the development and installation of software for internal use are capitalised at historical cost and
amortised over the estimated useful life apart from software other intangible assets mainly include customer
relationships assets under development licences and concessions other intangible assets acquired in a business
combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date

an asset is transferred to its respective intangible asset category at the moment it is ready for use and is amortised
using the straightline method over its estimated useful life other intangible assets are valued at the lower of
historical cost less amortisation and impairment

property plant and equipment
property plant and equipment are valued at historical cost using a component approach less depreciation and
impairment losses in addition to the costs of acquisition the company also includes costs of bringing the asset to
working condition handling and installation costs and the nonrefundable purchase taxes under the component
approach each component of an item of property plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to
the total cost of the item shall be depreciated separately

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method based on the estimated useful life taking into account any
residual value the assets residual value and useful life is reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance
sheet date subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as
appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably

land is not depreciated system software is capitalised and amortised as a part of the tangible fixed asset for which
it was acquired to operate because the estimated useful life is inextricably linked to the estimated useful life of the
associated asset

leases of property plant and equipment are classified as finance leases if the company has substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the
leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments the corresponding rental obligations net of
finance charges are included in longterm debt property plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are
depreciated over the shorter of the assets useful life and the lease term



                                                                                                                           40

chapter 5 financial statements continued
impairment of goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment
goodwill
goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication
that the asset might be impaired

for the purposes of assessing impairment assets are grouped by cash generating unit the lowest level at which
there are separately identifiable cash flows for impairment testing of goodwill the cash generating unit is defined
as the lowest level where goodwill is monitored for internal purposes this level may be higher than the level used
for testing other assets but is not at a higher level than an operating segment

if the recoverable value of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit pro
rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit the recoverable amount is the higher of the fair
value less cost to sell and value in use in assessing the value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted
to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the asset specific risks for the purpose of assessing impairment corporate assets are allocated to
specific cash generating units before impairment testing the allocation of the corporate assets is based on the
contribution of those assets to the future cash flows of the cash generating unit under review impairment losses
recognised for goodwill are not reversed in a subsequent period goodwill following the acquisition of associates is
not separately recognised or tested for impairment

impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in a subsequent period

finite lived intangible assets and property plant and equipment
at each balance sheet date express reviews the carrying amount of its finite lived intangible assets and property
plant and equipment to determine whether there is an indication that those assets have suffered an impairment
loss if any indication exists the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent if
any of the impairment loss an asset is impaired if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value the
recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use

if the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the
asset is reduced to its recoverable amount any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income
statement impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed only if there has been a change in the
estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised the
recoverable amount shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment
loss been recognised in prior years a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income
statement

financial assets and liabilities
express classifies financial assets and liabilities into the following categories financial assets and liabilities at fair
value through profit or loss loans and receivables heldtomaturity investments availableforsale financial assets
and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost the classification depends on the purpose for which the
financial asset or liability was acquired management determines the classification of express financial assets and
liabilities at initial recognition

financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include derivatives and other assets and
liabilities that are designated as such upon initial recognition

measurement at fair value requires disclosure of measurement methods by level of the following fair value
measurement hierarchy
1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets
2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly prices or indirectly derived from prices
3 inputs not based on observable market data

financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are initially recorded at fair value net of
transaction costs incurred and subsequently remeasured at fair value on the balance sheet express designates
certain derivatives as hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities of a firm commitment fair value
hedge hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted
transaction cash flow hedge or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation net investment hedge




                                                                                                                                41

section a general
chapter 5 financial statements continued
if a derivative is designated as a cash flow or net investment hedge changes in its fair value are considered to be
effective and recorded in a separate component in equity until the hedged item is recorded in income any portion
of a change in the fair value of a derivative that is considered to be ineffective or is excluded from the
measurement of effectiveness is immediately recorded in the income statement

at the inception of the transaction express documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged
items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions the
company also documents the assessment both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis of whether the
derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of
hedged items

changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the
income statement together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to
the hedged risk

amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will
affect profit and loss for example when the forecasted sale that is hedged takes place however when the
forecasted transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset the gains and losses
previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the asset or
liability

when a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting any cumulative gains or losses existing in equity at that time remain in equity until the forecasted
transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement when a forecasted transaction is no longer expected
to occur the cumulative gains or losses that were reported in equity are immediately transferred to the income
statement

loans granted and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market and for which express has no intention of trading loans and receivables are included in
trade and other receivables in the balance sheet except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance
sheet date these are classified as noncurrent assets

heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturities where express has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity

availableforsale financial assets are nonderivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or
not classified in any of the other categories above they are included in noncurrent assets unless management
intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months as per the balance sheet date availableforsale financial
assets are carried at fair value

loans and receivables and heldtomaturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
method unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified
as at fair value through profit and loss are directly recorded in the income statement

unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets classified as availableforsale are
recognised in equity when financial assets classified as availableforsale are sold or impaired the accumulated fair
value adjustments are included in the combined income statement as a gain or a loss

the fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices if the market for a financial asset is not
active and for unlisted securities express establishes fair value by using valuation techniques these include the
use of recent arms length transactions reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and
discounted cash flow analysis refined to reflect the issuers specific circumstances

express assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of
financial assets is impaired in the case of equity securities classified as availableforsale a significant or prolonged
decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether the securities are
impaired if any such evidence exists for availableforsale financial assets the cumulative loss  measured as the
difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value less any impairment loss on that financial asset
previously recognised in income statement  is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement
impairment losses on equity instruments recognised in the income statement are not reversed through equity

financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred
and are subsequently stated at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and
the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the financial liability using the
effective interest method

inventory
inventories of raw materials and finished goods are valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable value
historical cost is based on weighted average prices

accounts receivable
accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method less allowance for impairment an allowance for impairment of accounts receivable is
established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according
to the original terms of the receivables the amount of the allowance is the difference between the assets carrying
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate the amount
of the loss is recognised in the income statement any reversal of the impairment loss is included in the income
statement at the same line as where the original expense has been recorded

the risk of uncollectibility of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with and the
past due status of doubtful debtors while large accounts are assessed individually based on factors that include
ability to pay bankruptcy and payment history in addition debtors in certain countries are subject to a higher
collectability risk which is taken into account when assessing the overall risk of uncollectability the assumptions
and estimates applied for determining the valuation allowance are reviewed periodically

cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at fair value cash and cash equivalents include cash at
hand bank account balances bills of exchange and cheques only those which can be cashed in the shortterm all
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase are considered to be
cash equivalents bank overdrafts are not netted off from cash and cash equivalents

assets of disposal group classified as held for sale and discontinued operations
assets or disposal groups held for sale are classified as assets held for sale and stated at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is recovered principally through a sale
transaction rather than through continuing use assets held for sale are no longer amortised or depreciated from
the time they are classified as such

operations that represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or that are part of
a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a
subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale and either have been disposed of or have been classified as
held for sale are presented as discontinued operations in express income statement

provisions for pension liabilities
tnt nv is the sponsoring employer for the dutch pension plan which is externally funded and covers the
majority of tnts employees in the netherlands in accordance with ias 1934a the net defined benefit cost is
recognised in the corporate financial statements of tnt nv the participating express companies recognise the
costs equal to the contribution payable for the period in the financial statements and therefore account their
participation in the dutch pension plan on a defined contribution basis

the obligation for all pension and other postemployment plans that qualify as defined benefit plans is determined
by calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and deducting the fair value of the plan assets
express uses actuarial calculations projected unit credit method to measure the obligations and the costs for the
calculations actuarial assumptions are made about demographic variables such as employee turnover and
mortality and financial variables such as the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate is
determined by reference to market rates

cumulative actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the balance sheet the portion of the cumulative actuarial
gains and losses that exceed the higher of 10 of the obligation or 10 of the fair value of plan assets corridor
approach are recognised in the income statement over the employees expected average remaining service lives

past service costs if any are recognised on a straightline basis over the average vesting period of the amended
pension or early retirement benefits certain past service costs may be recognised immediately if the benefits vest
immediately

gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised at the date of the
curtailment or settlement

pension costs for defined contribution plans are expensed in the income statement when incurred or due

other provisions
provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event it is probable that an
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation provisions are measured at the present value of managements best
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date the discount rate
used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the liability the gross up of the provision following the discounting of the provision is recorded in the
profit and loss statement as interest expense

provisions are recorded for employee benefit obligations restructuring onerous contracts and other obligations

the provision for employee benefit obligations includes longservice leave or sabbatical leave jubilee or other long
service benefits longterm disability benefits and if they are not payable wholly within twelve months after the end
of the period profit sharing bonuses and deferred compensation the expected costs of these benefits are
recognised over the period of employment actuarial gains and losses and changes in actuarial assumptions are
charged or credited to income in the period such gain or loss occurs related service costs are recognised
immediately

the provision recorded for restructuring largely relates to termination benefits termination benefits are payable
when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary
redundancy in exchange for these benefits express recognises termination benefits when the company has
committed to terminate the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without
possibility of withdrawal or provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary
redundancy benefits falling due more than 12 months after balance sheet date are discounted to their present
value

provisions for onerous contracts are recorded when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation under the
contract exceed the economic benefits expected to arise from that contract taking into account impairment of
fixed assets first the provision for other obligations relates to legal and contractual obligations and received
claims

trade accounts payable
trade accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method

income taxes
the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax tax is recognised in the income statement
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income

the amount of income tax included in the income statement is determined in accordance with the rules established
by the taxation authorities based on which income taxes are payable or recoverable

deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities and the tax base of assets and liabilities are calculated using the substantively enacted tax rates expected
to apply when they are realised or settled deferred tax assets are recognised if it is probable that they will be
realised deferred tax assets and liabilities where a legally enforceable right to offset exists and within the same tax
group are presented net in the balance sheet

revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration of received amounts or receivable amounts

amounts received in advance are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are rendered to customers or goods
are delivered

net sales

sharebased payments
express has equitysettled sharebased compensation plans sharebased payment transactions are transactions in
which express receives benefits from its employees in consideration for tnt nvs equity instruments the fair
value of the sharebased transactions is recognised as an expense part of the employee costs and a corresponding
increase in equity over the vesting period the fair value of sharebased payments under the companys
performance share plan is calculated using the monte carlo model the equity instruments granted do not vest
until the employee completes a specified period of service

has complied with the conditions associated with the grant grants that compensate express for expenses incurred
are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same period in which the expenses are
recognised grants that compensate express for the cost of an asset are deducted from the historical value of the
asset and recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset

operating leases
leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating
leases payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the
income statement on a straightline basis over the period of the lease

combined statement of cash flows

translated at average exchange rates exchange rate differences affecting cash items are shown separately in the
statement of cash flows receipts and payments with respect to taxation on profits are included in the cash flow
from operating activities interest payments are included in cash flows from operating activities while interest
receipts are included in cash flows from investing activities the cost of acquisition of subsidiaries associates and
investments insofar as it was paid for in cash is included in cash flows from investing activities acquisitions of
subsidiaries are presented net of cash balances acquired cash flows from derivatives are recognised in the
statement of cash flows in the same category as those of the hedged item

segment reporting
operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decisionmakers codm who are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of
the operating segments the codm have been identified as the board of management of tnt nv which makes
strategic decisions the board of management receives operational and financial information on a monthly basis for
express and other networks as these were two of the segments of the tnt group due to the demerger of the
express business the segment information in the 2010 combined financial statements focuses on the operating
segments of the express business that will be the reportable segments going forward as a consequence the 2010
segment information discloses details relating to the operating segments of the express business these are europe
 mea aspac americas and other networks for comparison purposes the 2009 segment information has
been revised accordingly

critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying
express accounting policies
the preparation of the financial statements of express requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of express financial statements estimates and judgements are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances

express makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future the resulting accounting estimates will by
definition seldom equal the related actual results the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are
discussed below

business combinations
express accounts for all its business combinations applying the acquisition method unless it is a combination of
entities under common control the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised and measured on
the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition to determine fair values of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed express must make estimates and use valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available
any excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired represents
goodwill

for purposes of preparation of the combined financial statements internal reorganisations or transfer of businesses
between express companies were accounted for at predecessor carrying amounts these transactions did not give
rise to goodwill

impairment of assets
in determining impairments of intangible assets including goodwill tangible fixed assets and financial fixed assets
management must make significant judgements and estimates to determine whether the fair value of the cash flows
generated by those assets is less than their carrying value determining cash flows requires the use of judgements
and estimates that have been included in the strategic plans and longrange forecasts of express the data
necessary for executing the impairment tests are based on management estimates of future cash flows which
require estimating revenue growth rates and profit margins for applied sensitivities on intangible assets see note
1

depreciation and amortisation of tangible and intangible fixed assets
tangible and intangible fixed assets except for goodwill are depreciated or amortised at historical cost using a
straightline method based on the estimated useful life taking into account any residual value the assets residual
value and useful life are based on express best estimates and reviewed and adjusted if required at each balance
sheet date

impairment of receivables
the risk of uncollectability of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with and the
past due status of doubtful debtors while large accounts are individually assessed based on factors that include
ability to pay bankruptcy and payment history in addition debtors in certain countries are subject to a higher
collectability risk which is taken into account when assessing the overall risk of uncollectability should the
outcome differ from the assumptions and estimates revisions to the estimated valuation allowances would be
required

restructuring
restructuring charges mainly result from restructuring operations including combinations andor relocations of
operations changes in express strategic direction or managerial responses to declining demand increasing costs
or other market factors restructuring provisions reflect many estimates including those pertaining to separation
costs reduction of excess facilities contract settlements and tangible asset impairments actual experience has
been and may continue to be different from these estimates

income taxes
the company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions significant judgement is required in determining
the worldwide provision and liability for income taxes there are many transactions and calculations where the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business express recognises liabilities for tax


                                                                                                                         47

issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due based on its best interpretation of the relevant
tax laws and rules where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially
recorded such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such
determination is made

express recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the
deferred tax asset to be recovered this is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the
company operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable in the event that actual results
differ from these estimates in future periods and depending on the tax strategies that the company may be able to
implement changes to the recognition of deferred tax assets could be required which could impact express
financial position and net profit

accounting for assets classified as held for sale
accounting for assets classified as held for sale requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates such as
the assumptions used in the fair value calculations as well as the estimated costs to sell

contingent liabilities
legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending against the company in various jurisdictions due to the
uncertainty inherent in such matters it is often difficult to predict the final outcome the cases and claims against
the company often raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues that are subject to many uncertainties and
complexities including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular case and claim the
jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law in the normal course of business express consults with legal
counsel and certain other experts on matters related to litigations

express accrues a liability when it is determined that an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated in the event an adverse outcome is possible or an estimate is not determinable the
matter is disclosed

changes in accounting policies and disclosures
a new and amended standards adopted by express

the following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year
beginning 1 january 2010 and have been adopted by express

 ifrs 3 revised business combinations and consequential amendments to ias 27 consolidated and separate
  financial statements ias 28 investments in associates and ias 31 interests in joint ventures are effective
  prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
  annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 july 2009 ifrs 3 revised continues to apply the acquisition
  method to business combinations significant changes have been incorporated including the remeasurement
  through the income statement of contingent payments associated with the purchase of the business expensing
  of all acquisitionrelated costs and the choice on an acquisitionbyacquisition basis to measure the non
  controlling interest in the acquiree at fair vale or at the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the
  acquirers net assets express will apply ifrs 3 revised prospectively to all business combinations as from 1
  january 2010 prior acquisitions will not be affected by this revised ifrs statement the impact of ifrs 3
  revised on the 2010 financial position profit and loss statement and cash flow is limited due to the absence of
  significant acquisitions in 2010

 ias 27 revised requires the effects of all transactions with noncontrolling interests to be recorded in equity if
  there is no change in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses the
  standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured
  to fair value and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss ias 27 revised has had no impact on the current
  period as no transactions whereby an interest in an entity is retained after the loss of control of that entity and
  there have been no transactions with noncontrolling interests

 ias 36 amendment impairment of assets effective 1 january 2010 the amendment clarifies that the largest
  cashgenerating unit or group of units to which goodwill should be allocated for the purposes of impairment
  testing is an operating segment as defined by paragraph 5 of ifrs 8 operating segments that is before the
  aggregation of segments with similar economic characteristics this amendment has no significant impact on
  goodwill impairment testing as the largest cash generating unit for impairment testing was already lower or
  equal to the operating segment structure

 ifric 18 transfers of assets from customers effective for transfer of assets received on or after 1 july 2009
  this interpretation clarifies the requirements of ifrs for agreements in which an entity receives from a
  customer an item of property plant and equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the
  customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services such
  as a supply of electricity gas or water

 ifric 9 reassessment of embedded derivatives and ias 39 financial instruments recognition and
  measurement effective 1 july 2009 this amendment to ifric 9 requires an entity to assess whether an
  embedded derivative should be separated from a host contract when the entity reclassifies a hybrid financial
  asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category

 ifric 16 hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation effective 1 july 2009 this amendment states that
  in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation qualifying hedging instruments may be held by any entity
  or entities within express including the foreign operation itself as long as the designation documentation and
  effectiveness requirements of ias 39 that relate to a net investment hedge are satisfied

 ifric 17 distribution of noncash assets to owners effective on or after 1 july 2009 and ifrs 5
  amendment noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations the interpretation was published
  in november 2008 this interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity
  distributes noncash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends ifrs 5 has also
  been amended to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when they are available for
  distribution in their present condition and the distribution is highly probable the amendment clarifies that ifrs
  5 specifies the disclosures required in respect of noncurrent assets or disposal groups classified as held for
  sale or discontinued operations

   this ifric 17 and ifrs 5 amendment have no impact on the presentation of assets and liabilities in the
   combined statement of the financial position of express as at 31 december 2010

c new standards amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1
january 2010 and not early adopted by express

 ias 24 revised related party disclosures issued in november 2009 ias 24 revised is mandatory for
  periods beginning on or after 1 january 2011 and clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party the
  group will apply the revised standard from 1 january 2011 when the revised standard is applied the group
  and the parent will need to disclose any transactions between its subsidiaries and its associates
 ifric 19 extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments effective 1 july 2010 the interpretation
  clarifies the accounting by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the
  entity issuing equity instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability debt
  or equity swap the group will apply the interpretation from 1 january 2011 it is not expected to have any
  impact on the group or companys financial statements
 amendments to ifric 14 prepayments of a minimum funding requirement the amendments correct an
  unintended consequence of ifric 14 ias 19  the limit on a defined benefit asset minimum funding
  requirements and their interaction without the amendments entities are not permitted to recognise as an
  asset some voluntary prepayments for minimum funding contributions this was not intended when ifric 14
  was issued and the amendments correct this the group will apply these amendments for the financial
  reporting period commencing on 1 january 2011 the amendment will not result in a material impact on the
  group or companys financial statements

goodwill
goodwill including that generated from the acquisition of tnt and gd express worldwide is allocated to express
cash generating units cgus and tested for impairment the cgus correspond to operations in a region and
the nature of the services that are provided being northern europe southern europe  mea aspac north
america south america and other networks

in 2010 the additions to goodwill of 13 million are the result of the finalisation of the purchase price allocation of
the 2009 acquisitions of expresso ara√ßatuba 5 million and lit cargo 8 million exchange rate differences
resulted in an increase of goodwill by 44 million 2009 37 for acquisitions in brazil chile and china due to the
strengthening of the relating currencies compared to the euro

in 2009 the increase of goodwill amounted to 54 million arising from acquisitions of expresso ara√ßatuba 37
million and lit cargo 17 million this resulted also in an increase of the other intangibles of 36 million due to
first time consolidation of these entities

the recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and fair value less cost to sell fair value less cost to sell
represents the best estimate of the amount express would receive if it sold the cgu the fair value was estimated
on basis of the present value of future cash flows taken into account cost to sell

for mature markets the estimated future net cash flows are based on a fiveyear forecast and business plan for
emerging markets where no steady state has been achieved to date a tenyear forecast 2009 seven years has
been applied to estimate the future net cash flows management concluded that it is more reasonable to assume
that a steady state is realised in ten years instead of seven years in the emerging markets where express has a

presence prior to 2009 express used a tenyear forecast period however in 2009 the strategic planning time
frame was reduced to seven years the applied growth rate does not exceed the longterm average growth rate of
the related operations and markets the cash flow projections based on financial budgets have been approved by
management

express determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for market
development the weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry
reports the discount rates used in the cgus valuations vary between 10 to 14 pretax posttax 8 to 10
to reflect specific risks relating to the relevant cgus

key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values of all cgus are the following
 maturity of the underlying market market share and volume development in order to determine the revenue
   mix and growth rate
 level of capital expenditure in network related assets which may affect the further roll out of the network
 level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development taken into account the nature of
   the underlying costs and potential economies of scale and
 discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency and inflation
   related risks

management has carried out an impairment test and concluded that the recoverable amount of the individual
cgus is higher than the carrying amount due to current market circumstances and relating uncertainty a
sensitivity analysis has been applied for all cgus this sensitivity analysis included the individual impact of the
following items which are considered to be the most critical when determining the recoverable value
 increase of the discount factor by 1 and 2
 increase of capital expenditure of 5 per year and
 decrease of operating income of 5 per year

the sensitivity analyses showed that there is limited headroom present for the cgu south america which covers
the goodwill of the acquisitions in brazil being expresso ara√ßatuba 52 million and mercurio 170 million and in
chile being lit cargo 29 million for a total amount of 251 million brazils 2010 results have been negatively
impacted by integrationrelated costs and oneoff adjustments of 20 million in addition the actual 2010
performance was below forecast consequently management intensively reviewed the strategic business forecasts
resulting in a reduced forecast for brazil for the period 20112020 the improvement of the profitability and the
successful integration of mercurio and expresso ara√ßatuba is a priority reengineering and further automation of
operations within depots is a key area of attention management is also implementing initiatives to further
strengthen administrative processes and systems

as at 31 december and based on the latest actual forecast with a forecast period of 10 years the goodwill of the
cgu south america is fully recoverable with the recoverable value exceeding the carrying amount by around 120
million the key parameter in this sensitivity analyses is the applied discount factor and the development of the
operating income if the discount factor would increase with 1 the headroom would be around 40 million
2 20 when operating income would reduce with 5 year on year the headroom would be around 90
million the results from the sensitivity analysis for the cgu south america therefore showed a headroom which
could vary between 20 million to 90 million

the headroom would have been negative for an amount of 50 million if as in 2009 a seven year forecast would
have been applied this would have resulted in a goodwill impairment

total goodwill balance at 31 december 2010 amounted to 1703 million 2009 1646 of which express has
allocated 658 million 2009 658 to northern europe 574 million to southern europe  mea 2009 574
162 million to apsac 2009 148 251 million to south america 2009 208 0 million to north america
2009 0 and 58 million to other networks 2009 58

software and other intangible assets
at 31 december 2010 the software balance of 127 million 2009 131 included internally generated software
with a book value of 103 million 2009 109 the addition in software of 11 million is related to selfproduced
software of 3 million and 8 million of purchased software the reclassification of 29 million to selfproduced
software is due to finalised it projects

at 31 december 2010 other intangible assets of 62 million 2009 76 related to customer relationships of 28
million 2009 53 and software under construction of 34 million 2009 23 the reduction of 23 million in
other intangibles is due to adjustments to the fair values of brand name of 6 million and customer relationships of
17 million this is the result of the finalisation of the purchase price allocation of expresso ara√ßatuba and lit
cargo

the estimated amortisation expenses for software and other intangibles for the subsequent five years are 2011
47 million 2012 43 million 2013 32 million 2014 19 million 2015 14 million and thereafter 34
million besides software development express does not conduct significant research and development and
therefore does not incur research and development costs

in 2009 the impairment charge of 10 million related mainly to nonrecoverable customer relationship intangible

defined benefit plans in italy
in italy in accordance with italian law after the completion of employment employers have to pay to employees a
lump sum trattamento di fine rapporto tfr indemnity equivalent to the total annually revalued benefits
allocated to the years of service starting from 1 january 2007 a special tfr fund has been established this fund
managed by the national social security institute is financed by a contribution equal to the tfr allowance accrued
by the employee in the private sector all employers in the private sector having at least 50 employees are
required to contribute to this fund the tfr liability for express therefore consists of the unfunded benefits
accrued by the employees up to 31 december 2006 and of the obligation reflecting the annual revaluation of these
accrued benefits

at 31 december 2010 the defined benefit obligation of the express plans described above covers approximately
92 of the express group obligation for postemployment benefits and the relating plan assets cover approximately
94 of the express group plan assets

the beginning of each financial year actual circumstances may vary from these assumptions giving rise to a different
pension liability at yearend the difference between the projected pension liability based on the assumptions and
the actual pension liability at yearend are reflected in the balance sheet as part of the actuarial gains and losses if
the cumulative actuarial gains and losses exceed the corridor the excess will be amortized over the employees

in accordance with ias 1934a tnt nv as the sponsoring employer for the two dutch pension funds

benefit that offsets the defined benefit pension expense the relevant group companies also those within express
recognize in their financial statements the costs equal to the contribution payable for the period the operating
income of express therefore includes the contributions paid as defined contribution costs

express pension expense is affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations and the expected
longterm rate of return on plan assets management reviews these and other assumptions every year
measurement date for express postemployment benefits is 31 december changes in assumptions may occur as a
result of economic and market conditions if actual results differ from those assumed this will generate actuarial
gains or losses these are amortized over the employees expected average remaining service lives if they exceed
the corridor

the discount rate is based on the longterm yield on high quality corporate bonds management considers various
factors to determine the expected return on plan assets the expected return is based on the current longterm
rates of return on bonds and applies to these rates a suitable risk premium for the different asset components the
premium is based on the plans asset mix historical market returns and current market expectation

assumptions regarding future mortality are based on advice published statistics and experience per country the
majority of the defined benefit obligation relates to participants in europe in the netherlands the average life
expectancy of men after retiring at the age of 65 is 195 years 2009 182 the equivalent expectancy for women
is 216 years 2009 211

compliance with the dutch corporate governance code the key management may not sell their matching shares
before the earlier of five years from the date of grant or the end of the employment although any sale of shares for
the purpose of using the proceeds to pay for the tax relating to the grant of these shares is exempted

case they are paid 100 of their bonus in cash and can convert 25 as a grant of tnt shares with an associated
matching right in 2010 73123 2009 45879 2008 63290 and 2007 50913 if at least 50 of the shares

   preceding financial year by the share price on the euronext amsterdam on the date the grant is made 2010
   2291share
 the rights on matching shares are granted for zero costs and the number of shares is equal to the number of
   bonus shares
 the matching shares are delivered three years after the delivery of the bonus shares one matching share is
   delivered for each bonus share that has been retained for three years
 for each bonus share that is sold within three years the associated right to one matching share lapses if more
   than 50 of the bonus shares are sold within three years the entire right to matching shares lapses with
   immediate effect
 where a participant leaves the company for certain reasons retirement certain reorganisations disability or

deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities lowered the effective tax rate by 141 2009 364 the
remaining other increase of 47 reflects the net impact of several other positive and negative effects

compared to 2009 the effective tax rate improved significantly partly due to the absence of nondeductible
impairments in 2010 in 2009 a significant part of the recorded impairments was nondeductible which impacted

depreciation amortization impairments and share based payments this is 64 million higher compared to 2009
2009 285

the change in net pension liabilities of 6 million in 2010 2009 3 reflects the total express noncash employer
pension expense for the postemployment defined benefit plans of 7 million 2009 9 and comparable total
express cash contributions to various postemployment defined benefit plans for a total amount of 13 million

interest received the amounts are not netted in the income statement because under ifrs such offset needs in
practice to be irreversibly exercised from time to time

basis while economically the 3 million of interest received 2009 6 is fully set off against the 14 million 2009

primarily related to shortterm aircraft charter contracts and various service maintenance contracts these
contracts for service and maintenance relate primarily to facilities management security cleaning salary
administration and it support contracts

contingent tax liabilities
multinational groups of the size of express are exposed to varying degrees of uncertainty related to tax planning
and regulatory reviews and audits express accounts for its income taxes on the basis of its own internal analyses
supported by external advice express continually monitors its global tax position and whenever uncertainties
arise express assesses the potential consequences and either accrues the liability or discloses a contingent liability
in its financial statements depending on the strength of the companys position and the resulting risk of loss

contingent legal liabilities
ordinary course litigation
the company is involved in several legal proceedings relating to the normal conduct of its business such as claims
for loss of goods delays in delivery trademark infringements subcontracting and employment issues and general
liability the majority of these claims are for amounts below 1 million and are insured andor provided for
express does not expect any liability arising from any of these legal proceedings to have a material effect on its
results of operations liquidity capital resources or financial position the company believes it has provided for all
probable liabilities deriving from the normal course of business

li√®ge court case
in belgium judicial proceedings were launched by residents around li√®ge airport to stop night flights and seek
indemnification from the walloon region li√®ge airport and its operators including tnt on 29 june 2004 the
li√®ge court of appeal rejected the plaintiffs claims on the basis of a substantiated legal reasoning the plaintiffs
lodged an appeal with the belgian supreme court which overturned the 2004 judgement of the li√®ge court of
appeal on 4 december 2009 the matter has been sent to the brussels court of appeal for new submissions and
pleadings following a court of appeal session on 7 october 2010 a calendar of proceedings will be fixed shortly
however a new decision is not expected for at least two years

a similar claim was lodged on 5 may 2009 before the civil court of li√®ge by the town of riemst which is seeking
the closure of li√®ge airport the court rejected the claim on 14 april 2010 an appeal by riemst was introduced
on 14 september 2010 in which the town of riemst requested the court to pronounce a temporary measure that
will forbid the use of the extended runway 417 m of extension the court rejected the request on 12 october
2010 and has fixed a calendar of proceedings tnt has to submit its conclusions before 1 march 2011 the
hearing will take place on 14 february 2012 it is unlikely that the outcome of this proceeding will be different

foreign investigations
the company has received and responded to subpoenas from the united states office of foreign asset control
inquiring about its involvement in exports to countries sanctioned by the united states in addition the company
has received and responded to information requests from competition authorities in various jurisdictions and
cooperated with investigations in this context express does not expect any liability arising from any of those
investigations to have a material effect on its results of operation liquidity capital resources or financial position

29 financial risk management
no corresponding financial statement number

express activities expose the company to a variety of financial risks such as market risks including foreign
currency exchange risk and interest rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk all of these risks arise in the normal
course of business in order to manage the market risks express utilises a variety of financial derivatives

the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding express exposure to the financial risks described
above there are certain limitations and simplifications inherent in the analyses presented primarily due to the
assumption that rates change in a parallel fashion and instantaneously while at the same time for example the
impact of changes in interest on foreign exchange exposures and visa versa is ignored in addition the analyses are
unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts assumed

express uses derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of hedging exposures the company enters into
contracts related to derivative financial instruments for periods commensurate with its underlying exposures and
does not take positions independent of these exposures none of these financial instruments are leveraged or used
for trading purposes or to take speculative positions

financial risk management is carried out by group treasury under policies approved by the board of management
group treasury identifies evaluates and hedges financial risk in close cooperating with operating units the board
of management provides written principles for overall risk management as well as written policies covering specific
areas such as foreign exchange risk interest rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk periodic reporting on financial
risks has been embedded in the overall risk framework and has been provided to the board of management in a
structural way

interest rate risk
part of express borrowings and leases are against floating interest rates these floating interest rates may fluctuate
substantially and could have a material adverse effect on express financial results in any given reporting period
borrowings that are issued at variable rates expose the company to cash flow interest risks borrowings that are
issued at fixed rates expose the company to fair value interest rate risk express financial assets are on average of
such shortterm nature that they bear no significant fair value but do cause cash flow interest rate risks group
policy is to significantly limit the impact of interest fluctuations over a term of seven years as a percentage of
earnings before interest taxes deprecation and amortisation at 31 december 2010 express gross interest
bearing borrowings including finance lease obligations totalled 358 million 2009 434 of which 307 million
2009 359 was at fixed interest rate

although express generally enters into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivatives in order to attempt
to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations these measures may be inadequate or may subject the
company to increased operating or financing costs

at 31 december 2010 if interest rates on borrowings and financial assets had been 1 higher with other variables
held constant the profit before income tax would have been 7 million higher 2009 7 equity would be impacted
by 15 million 2009 14 due to the outstanding interest rate swaps with a nominal value of us239 million as
well as the 7 million 2009 7 impact on profit before income taxes see also note 30

foreign currency exchange risk
express operates on an international basis generating foreign currency exchange risks arising from future
commercial transactions recognised assets and liabilities investments and divestments in foreign currencies other
than the euro express functional and reporting currency express treasury department matches and manages the
intragroup and external financial exposures although the company generally enters into hedging arrangements and
other contracts in order to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations these measures may be inadequate or
may subject the company to increased operating or financing costs

management has set up a policy to require group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against the
functional currency group companies are required to hedge material balance sheet exposures via the use of
foreign exchange derivatives with group treasury whereby a financing company operated by group treasury
trades these foreign exchange derivatives with external banks express currently has no net investment hedges
outstanding significant acquisitions and local debt is usually funded in the currency of the underlying assets

credit risk
credit risk represents the loss that the company would incur if counterparties with whom express enters into
financial transactions are unable to fulfil the terms of the agreements credit risk arises from cash and cash
equivalents derivatives and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as credit exposures relating to
customers the company attempts to minimise its credit risk exposure by only transacting to financial institutions
that meet established credit guidelines and by managing its customers portfolio express continually monitors the
credit standing of financial counterparties and its customers individual risk limits are set on internal and external
ratings in accordance with limits set by the board of management the utilisation of credit limits is regularly
monitored at reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk the top ten customers of
express account for 3 of the outstanding trade receivables as per 31 december 2010

liquidity risk
prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash the availability of funding through an adequate
amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions due to the dynamic nature of
the underlying businesses express attempts to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines
available

express has the following undrawn committed facilities

capital structure management
it is the objective of express when managing the capital structure to safeguard its ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an
optimal capital structure express capital structure will be based on and managed along the following components
i maintain an investment grade credit rating at bbbbaa1 2 an availability of at least 400 million to 500
million of undrawn committed facilities 3 cash pooling systems facilitating optimized cash requirements for the
group and 4 a tax optimal internal and external funding focused at optimizing the cost of capital for the group
within longterm sustainable boundaries

the debts of express include finance leases for two boeing 747 freighters for a total of 179 million certain
clauses in these finance leases can be triggered by the lender upon the demerger of express as is the case for many
smaller mostly uncommitted overdraft and guarantee facilities around the world express will seek agreement with
the providers of these facilities to continue them on a standalone basis in addition express will require committed
bank facilities that it seeks to arrange in anticipation of the demerger among other things to assure the availability
of at least 400 million 500 million of undrawn committed facilities upon demerger

a lowerthantargeted initial credit rating or a subsequent downgrade in the credit rating of express may negatively
affect its ability to obtain funds from financial institutions retain investors and banks and increase its financing costs
by increasing the interest rates of its outstanding debt or the interest rates at which the company is able to
refinance existing debt or incur new debt this could affect its returns for shareholders and benefits for other
stakeholders

the terms and conditions of express material long and shortterm debts as well as its material drawn or
undrawn committed credit facilities do not include any financial covenants there are also no possibilities to
accelerate these material debts and committed facilities in case of a credit rating downgrade the debt and credit
facility instruments vary on a case by case basis and mostly contain customary clauses as are generally observed in
the market such as negative pledge conditions restrictions on the use of the proceeds of the sale of assets or
businesses and in most cases change of control clauses

chapter 6 regulatory environment
due to the importance of transport services to society express is affected by regulation


carbon management and reduction

eu emission trading scheme eu ets
the kyoto protocol established three mechanisms to be used by countries to attain emission reduction through
effective management of carbon emission trading joint implementation and clean development the directive
200387ec established a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the community in order
to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a costeffective and economically efficient manner
recognising that in the long term global emissions of greenhouse gases should be reduced by approximately 70
compared to 1990 levels

eu ets recognises three timebased key phases arranged in order of the polluting nature of industries the first
phase was from 2005 to 2007 covering heavy industry or service providers such as power oil refineries paper
and steel manufacturers the second phase from 2008 to 2012 expands the scope to include the aviation sector
while the third phase from 2013 to 2020 expands the scope to include other industries such as the aluminium
and ammonia production industries therefore as part of the regulatory obligations under the eu ets express
must monitor and report data regularly from 2010 onwards on all its aircraft

a key part of eu ets is the development of a monitoring plan that reports express emissions and tonnekilometre
data and the verification of this by an independent and accredited verifier the monitoring and reporting plans for
express aviation have been accepted by the local authorities the allocation of credits will take place in the second
quarter of 2011 based on our reported data for use in 2012

carbon reduction commitment  energy efficiency scheme crc
in november 2008 the united kingdom became the first country in the world to introduce a climate change act
which is now a uk legallybinding longterm framework for tackling climate change the act sets up a framework
for the united kingdom to achieve its longterm goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to ensure steps
are taken towards adapting to the impact of climate change

the uk government is therefore now bound by law to cut emissions by at least a third by 2020 and by at least
80 by 2050 and to embrace climate change and commit to a low carbon economy to help achieve this a new
mandatory carbon emission trading scheme called the crc has been introduced for large nonenergy intensive
organisations

the crc will apply to organisations that purchase more than 6000 mwh of electricity through halfhourly
metres express falls into this category and will be ranked in a performance league table using three metrics
 absolute metric measuring the relative change in absolute emissions
 growth metric measuring the change in emissions relative to revenue and
 early action metric determining whether organisations have taken voluntary steps to reduce emissions prior to
   the crc

the revenue raised from the sale of allowances was supposed to be recycled back to participants in the crc after
a sixmonth period and the amount of money paid back as an incentive to cut carbon emissions however the
government of the united kingdom as part of its costcutting strategy in 2010 decided not to comply express
will therefore have to pay this levy

express foresees the commitment to a low carbon economy being extended further into europe and other
countries and has included this in express global approach in the development of its longterm co2 efficiency
improvement objective in addition express is responding proactively by developing and implementing country
regional and divisional carbon reduction plans the initiatives to reduce its impacts are being supported through its
capital expenditure and budgetary process




                                                                                                                         95

chapter 6 regulatory environment continued

customs regulation

in 2010 customs legislation was influenced by increased security measures for crossborder traffic although more
pronounced in the eu with the modernised customs code and the draft implementing provisions the issue clearly
has a global effect elevated aviation security measures place additional responsibilities on the shoulders of customs
agencies at national borders and customs processes are being revised

with the introduction of enhanced customs risk assessment techniques applied to advanced data provided by the
carrier at both export and import points there has inevitably been a trend towards the introduction of more
regulated controls leading in turn to potentially negative impacts upon timesensitive services express response
has been to demonstrate continuously high levels of compliance with customs standards through its ongoing
strategy of achieving accreditation in the various authorised economic operator aeo programmes around the
world at the same time express has encouraged a measured approach by regulators through the trade
consultation process in order to ensure that trade facilitation does not become a victim of robust and overt
interference with legitimate trade using its services

mutual recognition by national customs administrations of aeo programmes and the establishment of secure
trade lanes between trading parties represent a key factor for express in its work with the world customs
organisation

technological advancement must be structurally supported by regulations to facilitate customstocustoms and
customstotrade exchange of data intelligence to counter criminal and terrorist activity within the supply chain
with the continued codification of modern customs practices express remains vigilant and engaged at the highest
level in the customs regulatory processes wherever they take place express aims to minimise the negative impact
of the introduction of intelligent riskbased approaches by customs enforcement agencies to the global supply
chain

the industry continues to look critically at the outcome of the eus introduction of the export control system in
2009 the import control system in 2011 and the complementary regulatory changes that allow for customs
management of safety and security standards in the movement of cargo across the borders of the eu with similar
models being considered by countries as diverse as china and russia the lessons learnt by express through the
ongoing consultation process with customs administrations will continue to pay dividends in preparing for new
initiatives in the customs domain and ensuring the integrity of the supply chain for its customers

safety

aviation security
escalating concerns about global terrorism and the current levels of aviation security which are considered to be
inadequate have resulted in governments and airline operators around the world either adopting or contemplating
the adoption of stricter disciplines and additional emergency measures for security in passenger and all cargo
aircraft this will increase operating costs for businesses including those in the transportation industry for
example the eu has recently increased the security requirements for air cargo which has had significant
implications for security and customs clearance processes in addition many aviation regulators around the world
are proposing mandatory use of xray screening equipment enhanced screening methods and investment in
intelligenceled security processes

express may be unable to use commercial linehaul due to increased regulatory pressure on security these
emergency measures prevent certain types of goods from travelling on commercial passenger airlines thereby
restricting the movement of these goods to cargo aircraft causing potential service delays and increased costs

these emergency measures are under review by various governments who are seeking to introduce new security
standards for implementation globally these new standards may directly result in or indirectly cause commercial
passenger airlines banning the carriage of cargo on passenger flights this would drastically limit express capability
to provide current levels of connectivity and service without significant investments

night flights
express operates various types of aircraft throughout europe and between europe and asia as a result express is
required to comply with a wide variety of international and national laws and regulations in some of the markets in
which express operates regulations have been adopted or proposed which impose nighttime takeoff and

chapter 7 corporate responsibility strategy
introduction
the economic climate over the past year has been challenging for express the corporate responsibility cr
strategy has been developed to embrace change as well as find innovative solutions to address restructuring and
enhance corporate responsibility in 2010 the emphasis was placed on the long term and organisational
responsiveness of the cr agenda

corporate responsibility has evolved into being recognised as an intrinsic part of the express business model an
investment that creates competitive advantage and helps express to achieve sustainable growth express
acknowledges the need to transition its corporate responsibility efforts beyond standard risk and reputation
management and to embed the cr strategy into its operations and daytoday management

in recent years express has made considerable progress on co2 efficiency and has set a solid foundation to
consolidate these achievements and to further embed the cr strategy within both the mature and emerging
businesses

express will also continue to publish an integrated annual report including nonfinancial information together with
its financial data the express management board firmly believes that improved cr performance is sustained
through continuous improvement and actions taken in the daytoday management of the core business this
chapter outlines express cr strategy the output of the multistakeholder dialogue and a view on 2011 objectives
more detailed insight into express cr performance is provided in chapter 8 and the assurance report on the cr
section is included in chapter 9

corporate responsibility strategy
the foundation of the express cr strategy comprises five internationallyrecognised management standards
namely workplace safety ohsas 18001 social responsibility sa 8000 personal growth of employees
investors in people environmental management iso 14001 and operational excellence iso 9001 tnt
started these certifications back in 2004 and express remains committed to them express demonstrates this
commitment by making it compulsory for new acquisitions to implement the certifications standards individual
implementation plans have been developed to ensure that newly acquired companies are brought up to the express
standard as soon as possible

express cr strategy focuses on three pillars that express believes have the greatest material impacts
 employees employee engagement human rights and health and safety
 environment carbon efficiency and air quality and
 other stakeholders customer satisfaction subcontractor and supplier performance

the three pillars of focus are complemented by a fourth pillar of voluntary contributions to society through
express partnership with the united nations world food programme wfp this is covered by the repositioned
moving the world mtw strategy that is now based on sharing knowledge and skills emergency response
advocacy and engagement and building partnerships

providing a safe and healthy environment for employees and others that may be affected by its operations is vital to
the success of express express ambition is therefore to meet and exceed where applicable all obligations in the
health and safety area

express also recognises the fact that climate change and other environmental issues are shaping the expectations of
key stakeholders and aims to focus on sustaining its position as a global cr leader in the industry express has
therefore committed to ambitious targets such as a 40 improvement of the co2 efficiency index by 2020 by
continuously challenging the business and by investing in clean technologies express continues to address
customers expectations and deliver innovative and more sustainable solutions




                                                                                                                       98

section b corporate responsibility
chapter 7 corporate responsibility strategy continued


customer focus and satisfaction are at the heart of express activities express will also encourage its suppliers and
subcontractors to adopt the same approach as express with respect to corporate responsibility one particular
area of attention relates to subcontractor health and safety performance

while it is important to set targets against the cr strategy pillars a critical success factor is to identify and
implement the actions that will enable express to meet the targets express has therefore identified the following
actions for the implementation of its cr strategy which it will diligently pursue
 ensure that the corporate programmes address challenging social and environmental issues while striving to
    improve business performance
 optimise results through simultaneously focusing on economic social and environmental performance and
    governance each area will have clearly defined initiatives to target different stakeholder groups with
    performance reported by the appropriate medium
 develop excellent leaders to ensure that the mission vision values and business principles of express reflect a
    cr culture reinforced by all levels of its management structure with an aim to influence the sector in which it
    operates
 engage in stakeholder dialogues to identify key issues and where discrepancies or issues arise with regard to
    the current cr strategy and policies engage in discussions on possible solutions and mitigating actions express
    continues to develop and implement its cr principles into procurement and operational processes and
    procedures to improve the supply chains subcontractors social environmental and service performance
 integrate cr initiatives and approaches into the business to ensure that policies and practices are effectively
    reflecting express mission and ambition
 continue to commit knowledge skills and resources to support the world food programme in fighting hunger
    worldwide and food insecurity the twoway and flexible approach will maximise the synergy and have a
    positive impact on the partnership on a local regional and global level

stakeholder dialogue

the express management board is committed to putting its ambitious cr strategy into practice and to achieve
express cr mission which is to share responsibility for the world in which it operates this mission is reflected in
the collaboration with key stakeholders and other sector members express also continues to integrate its cr
strategy and initiatives into its business to ensure that its policies and practices effectively reflect its mission and
ambition

stakeholder dialogue
to better understand stakeholder perspectives perceptions and concerns regarding risks and responsibilities
resulting from the express operations a multistakeholder dialogue is organised annually by a crossfunctional team
to engage with all stakeholder groups the stakeholder dialogue supports express in critically reviewing its strategy
to ensure that the cr policies and practices effectively reflect express mission and ambition

express has identified the following key stakeholder groups which reflect the groups that have the most significant
impact on express business
 employees
 customers
 subcontractors
 suppliers
 investors including the social responsibility investor community and
 civil society

in order to identify its stakeholders express investigated during 2008 its impact on key stakeholders by using
survey findings and management interview feedback to understand where express has the greatest impact on
society and the environment express has listened to and taken on board their opinions as to the way forward the
results of these investigations confirm that where customers employees and regulations shape the operational
environment that facilitates or limits express potential success express operations have the greatest direct impact
on its employees the environment and selected other stakeholders

due to the success of the european focused multistakeholder dialogue and survey in 2009 the scope was
expanded in 2010 to include stakeholders in asia and the middle east as well as the global employee stakeholder
group to provide a wellbalanced representation of all stakeholders the stakeholder survey was sent to 1200


                                                                                                                           99

such as familiarity with cr communication and opinions of express cr strategy and performance

an analysis of the survey results highlighted the following key issues
 familiarity with the cr reports could improve significantly while internal and external communication on cr
   could also increase
 express is widely regarded as a sustainable organisation with an ambitious cr strategy
 the top four focus areas are carbon efficiency of operations health and safety satisfied customers and positively
   engaged employees
 european stakeholders are more positive about the cr strategy compared with those in the asia and middle
   east regions
 in asia and the middle east human rights is an important issue while europe by comparison is more focused
   on the carbon efficiency of its operations
 specific interest was expressed in the importance of cr performance as part of selection criteria for
   subcontractors as subcontractors have a major impact on the total cr performance

based on the outcomes of the online survey the following three subjects were selected for further discussion
during the multistakeholder dialogue
 the scope of cr issues that should be reported
 the importance of subcontractors cr performance and
 the relevance of voluntary contributions to society

multistakeholder dialogue results
on 14 december 2010 a multistakeholder dialogue was organised at tnts head office in the netherlands
tnt welcomed all stakeholder groups employees customers subcontractors investors suppliers and members
of civil society of which a total of 21 external stakeholders attended the dialogue to discuss the three selected
subjects see above and to deliberate on stakeholders concerns and opinions with respect to cr

the main outcomes of the discussions were as follows
 in relation to the scope of cr issues that should be reported  the content of cr reporting by express is
   considered to be both extensive and distinctive however stakeholders recommended that a more tailored
   reporting could improve clarity for different stakeholder groups stakeholders further advised express to
   promote the use of webbased media in particular social media to increase familiarity with cr performance in
   addition stakeholders acknowledged the significance of transparent reporting specifically on cr challenges in
   conclusion stakeholders indicated cr reporting is well on track though current developments in this area
   would dictate an even further integration of cr information into reporting
 in relation to the importance of subcontractors cr performance  a large part of the carbon footprint of
   express is constituted by subcontractors emissions to influence subcontractors cr performance
   stakeholders recommended that express consult more frequently with subcontractors to discuss and improve
   their cr performance moreover standard cr performance indicators could be integrated into contractual
   standard terms and conditions nevertheless stakeholders understood the difficulty of implementing standard
   conditions as subcontractors differ considerably for example in expertise and cultural background thus to
   truly make a difference express should act as a responsible business throughout the supply chain
 in relation to the relevance of voluntary contributions to society  the voluntary contributions to society
   discussion focused on tnts moving the world mtw programme and its added value to express
   stakeholders believed that mtw could further improve its communication and objectives stakeholders also
   indicated that mtw should not be presented as a philanthropic part of express but as an integral component of
   employee engagement and express products and services

the express management board acknowledges the above outcomes and takes them into account when reviewing
its cr strategy and related actions the outcomes of the 2010 multistakeholder dialogue and survey provide a
general overview of opinions key risks and significant focus areas which may vary between the different
stakeholder groups

while there is a small decrease in the percentage of vacancies filled internally in 2010 the actual number of
vacancies for express selected increased significantly compared with 2009

learning and development
express strives to provide its employees with the necessary resources training and recognition to maximise their
own potential and individual contribution to the business it is also important that employees appreciate how they
contribute to express being a good corporate citizen and environmentally responsible operator

within express total overall training per fte in 2010 was 180 hours compared with 167 hours in 2009 this
modest increase was due to the go academy coaching and lean improvement programmes that were rolled
out during 2010

in express there are a number of other programmes aimed at developing its employees a learning centre pilot
for the central and eastern europe region was created in january 2010 the aim of the learning centre is to
deliver high quality training to all employees within the region based on local business needs the pilot will be
evaluated mid2011 with a shared service approach that works well in phases of economic downturn the
learning centre makes joint use of all resources within the region

voice  global engagement survey ges
express continues to focus on improving engagement of all employees voice was the vehicle used in 2010 to
measure express success in increasing employee pride and motivation in 2009 it was decided to postpone the
ges until 2010 therefore no reported 2009 results are available to allow for the development and piloting of the
new voice survey the employee engagement survey result within express was 69 in 2010 76 in 2008

when analysing the results and taking into account the organisational and economic climate two key areas of
improvement have been identified
 continuing focus on employee recognition and reward and
 improving efficiency and collaboration between teams and departments

action plans on these improvement areas have been developed with employees and progress is discussed on a
regular basis the defined action plans are
 to implement strategies to link reward and performance and share existing best practice recognition
   programmes within the business
 to promote ongoing use of the lean improvement methodology to optimise process efficiency and
 to enhance communication processes to promote teamwork and inform and involve employees about business
   priorities initiatives and developments

further improvement in the engagement programme is being formulated on a positive note the results also show
that express employees have clarity and understanding of the goals of the organisation and that they are committed
to providing excellent customer service

human rights
human rights refer to the basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled express has further aligned
itself with the framework developed by professor john ruggie of the business and human rights initiative by
updating the tnt business principles with a clearer statement on human rights this states that tnt is committed
to developing and promoting a culture where internationally recognised human rights contained within the universal
declaration of human rights proclaimed in a resolution of the united nations general assembly on 10 december 1948
are not infringed


                                                                                                                        107

the tnt business principles outline express commitment to human rights worldwide in four broad headings the
company the employees the business and the relationship with the world this is supported by the establishment
of a crossfunctional working group that strategically focuses on engaging in partnerships extending knowledge on
human rights and creating a connection with express business activities clearer roles and responsibilities are
being developed and policies and procedures are being updated to reflect express commitments

sa 8000 certification
sa 8000 sets standards to ensure transparent and acceptable working conditions with respect for human rights
to comply with the united nations universal declaration of human rights the international labour organisation
ilo conventions and oecd guidelines express aims to certify all its entities in nonoecd countries to the sa
8000 standard express is confident that this approach not only provides a framework to support compliance with
the laws and regulations in the countries in which it operates by preventing the use of child labour and forced
labour but also improves health and safety promotes freedom of association prevents discrimination implements
performance management processes and sets fair and adequate compensation and working hours

as part of this programme express also encourages all its suppliers and subcontractors to support the tnt
business principles and their commitment to social accountability

a total of 10 nonblameworthy road traffic fatal accidents occurred in 2010 which resulted in 10 thirdparty
fatalities compared with 2009 the rise in nonblameworthy road traffic fatal accidents is mainly caused by more
accidents in hoau due to business growth the majority of investigations conducted after the fatal accidents
identified unsafe behaviour of third parties as a contributing factor continued focus is therefore on journey and
driver management which is linked to express driver training programmes to ensure that express drivers enhance
their defensive driver skills

for subcontractor road traffic fatal accident information express relies on the subcontractors to report fatal
accidents involving their drivers and third parties see also paragraph other stakeholders in 2010 express
subcontractors reported 23 road traffic fatal accidents which resulted in eight subcontractor fatalities and 19
thirdparty fatalities in 2009 19 subcontractor road traffic fatal accidents were reported which resulted in 10
subcontractor fatalities and 11 thirdparty fatalities

serious accidents
express believes that monitoring and reporting serious accidents provides insights into accident patterns before
accidents become fatal serious accidents are divided into workplace and road traffic accidents though both
indicators remained at the same level as in 2009 express will continue its efforts in minimising the amount of
serious accidents worldwide

carbon management

ambitious co2 management creates opportunities
express acknowledges its influence on climate change and the improvement of its co2 efficiency is therefore an
important focal point of express environment pillar moreover the transition to a low carbon economy is
inevitable and gaining momentum this reality leads to new demands on express from various stakeholders
including governments customers investors and employees with stricter regulations and higher expectations

customers are actively reducing co2 in their supply chain which implies that co2 increasingly influences their
purchasing decisions transport suppliers that operate carbon efficiently are expected to gain market share key
stakeholders of express are increasingly focused on climate change risk management by managing co2
performance express is focused to meet key stakeholders expectations employees understand the need for co2
reduction and are keen to achieve the ambitious co2 management plans of express

managing co2 has become more important and is required if express is to stay ahead of tightening regulations in
the future and reduce dependency on increasingly expensive fossil fuels carbon efficiency clearly goes beyond
ensuring the license to operate it is increasingly becoming a differentiator a key success factor for express that
creates opportunities for the organisation such benefits have already proved successful by the provision of
preferred access for electric vehicles to inner city areas

co2 strategy
express co2 strategy is part of the planet me programme planet me is express framework for improving the
co2 efficiency of its global operations

besides technological solutions to improve performance of its operations express is also focusing on managing its
co2 emissions by encouraging behavioural change engaging with employees is a key method to make the co2

strategies effective two distinct groups need to be targeted management to create role models and build
credibility and drivers to sensitise them for co2 reduction ensure acceptability and provide them with advice
and technical solutions express has successfully targeted these two groups with dedicated initiatives

managing co2 emissions of subcontractors phase ii represents a particular challenge as express influence on
subcontractors is limited and dependent on local regulations therefore express works on proving innovative
solutions in owned operations first phase i
in 2010 a co2 strategy impact cost model was developed to estimate the cash flow impact of tnts 2020
commitment to improve co2 efficiency these insights are important to guide further strategy development

customers increasingly request express to provide them with transparency on the co2 footprint caused by the
transportation of their consignments with system co2 express has developed dedicated services to respond to
this requirement

express has defined strategies aligned with its core operational activities to improve co2 efficiency
 air transport
 road transport and
 buildings

air transport
express continues to optimise its operations by improving the fuel efficiency of its air fleet through continuous fleet
renewal and the implementation of various operational measures furthermore express is collaborating with
governments to accelerate improvements in air traffic management optimising operations and improving air traffic
management will deliver tangible reductions in emissions however in order to drastically reduce co2 emissions
groundbreaking aviation technologies or alternative fuels are needed airplanes will still fly on liquid fuels for
several decades but express believes aviation biofuels are a sustainable solution for the mid term and will actively
contribute to influence the sector and create a market for these fuels

road transport
substantial gains in fuel efficiency in road transport will be delivered by deploying the highest environmental
standard vehicles and the use of intelligent board computers in addition to several smaller measures to achieve
drastic reductions in co2 emissions a switch from fossil fuels to alternative fuels is required for pickup and
delivery operations electric vehicles are seen as the most promising solution and have been introduced into fleet
operations in several countries for linehaul operations focus will be on the use of sustainable biofuels

buildings
express believes that incorporating energy efficiency measures in the design of new buildings in addition to a
number of other minor measures leads to concrete improvements in co2 efficiency express is also exploring the
deployment of onsite generation of renewable electricity such as photovoltaic energy to live up to the energy
demand of buildings

co2 target and performance
the provision of accurate and timely co2 data is a key requirement for effectively managing co2 performance
express has successfully implemented a monitoring and reporting system that provides operating units with easy
access to accurate information on cr performance including co2 metrics

in 2010 express published its target to improve the co2 efficiency index co2 target by 40 by 2020 compared
to the 2007 baseline year the co2 index combines the operational performance in express core operational
activities air transport road transport and building operations into one indexed metric this target is very
ambitious but also realistic as it is based on actual reduction potential during 2011 the target will be reviewed to
ensure that it is still ambitious and reflects the actions that were set in 2010

the co2 target is only credible when it is linked to concrete actions the co2 target therefore comprises various
measures in the core operational activities of express some of these measures can be regarded as businessas
usual with measures that are businessdriven while others require deployment of innovative solutions
nonetheless the target can only be realised with dedicated efforts in fuel and energy efficiency that have a positive
impact on co2 performance
a structured co2 management process was introduced in 2010 to translate the 2020 co2 target into tangible
action plans at operational level carbon reduction action plans were developed and agreed at country level these

developments in 2010

driver behaviour
express employs and subcontracts more than 10000 drivers to deliver documents and parcels in communities all
over the world express global driver training is focused on raising driver awareness regarding road safety fuel
efficiency providing continuous feedback on their impact on co2 reduction and imparting the best possible skills
on the road to limit their impacts on these areas

express is always looking for crosssector initiatives to increase the value of its projects in the area of
environmental management express feels that searching for a common solution adds more value to its
stakeholders than competitiveness for the first time ever transport sector competitors express and dhl jointly
organised and participated in a driving competition called the drivers challenge this unique event saw pickup
and delivery pud drivers from both multinationals competing for the title of best driving team the event was
inspired by tnts annual drive me challenge with the objective to challenge drivers on their level of fuel
efficiency road safety customer excellence and speed of their completion express plans to encourage more
industry players to participate in similar driving challenges in the future in order to jointly work on sectorwide
environmental solutions

electric vehicles
switching from conventional diesel or gasoline fuels to more co2 efficient transport fuels can dramatically reduce
co2 emissions for pickup and delivery operations in urban areas express identified electric vehicles as one of the
most effective ways to minimise the carbon impact express operates 51 electric delivery trucks in the united
kingdom and also introduced electric vehicles in other countries including china and the netherlands in paris 12
cargo bikes are being used to minimise polluting inner city areas more pilots are underway and further rollout is
planned for 2011

customer reporting
express customers are increasingly asking for a better understanding of the companys activities in all areas of cr
and specifically the co2 footprint caused by the transportation of their consignments in 2011 express strives to
introduce a reliable measurement system based on guidance methodologies and conversion factors made available
by internationally acknowledged organisations such as the intergovernmental panel on climate change the
international energy agency and the greenhouse gas protocol the express method follows the principles of the
consignmentlevel carbon reporting guidelines published by the world economic forum these guidelines are a

major step forward in achieving alignment in reporting co2 emissions to customers in the future it will become
important to further develop the current guidelines into a more specific standard for customer reporting express
fully supports these standardisation efforts

express comprehensive model for estimating co2 emissions for major customers is called system co2 system
co2 is a customer information reporting system which is able to provide insight into the co2 footprint of
shipments already delivered co2 report system co2 is also able to predict the co2 footprint of potential new
businesses in connection with tenders and requests for quotations co2 quote the system can also show the
impact of planned changes in order to optimise the supply chain these changes can relate to services flows
consignments or weights co2 scenario

express will actively engage with customers to share expertise learn best practices and further define the service
offering in the area of co2 reduction

challenges faced in improving environmental performance

increased dependence on subcontractors versus managing co2 emissions
express co2 footprint consists for a significant part of subcontracted emissions 57 express is keen to improve
the co2 efficiency of subcontractors as it feels responsible for the complete footprint of the company including its
subcontracted activities the express business model is highly dependent on subcontractors and this is likely to
increase in the future it is therefore essential to manage the performance of subcontractors to achieve express
ambition to reduce co2 emissions

the cr strategy is being executed in two phases phase i is focused on cr performance improvement on owned
operations while phase ii is focused on securing accurate and reliable data for its subcontracted operations
express is exploring various options from voluntary schemes to contractual agreements as part of phase ii of the
cr strategy one of the actions taken by express to manage subcontracted emissions is to join forces with other
transportation companies and several industry leaders to launch an independent crosssector european initiative
this is aimed at reducing the environmental impact of road freight transport similar to the smart way programme
from the environmental protection agency in the united states the goal of the initiative is to improve and
evaluate the environmental performance of transportation companies by developing and establishing a standardised
system for measuring and monitoring emissions

the smart way programme creates value for subcontractors as it helps them to limit their fuel consumption and
increase their competitive advantage in the future this programme may provide opportunities for financing
environmentally friendly technologies and vehicles the aim is to implement a common monitoring and measuring
system that will be managed and governed by an independent body in europe

competition versus cooperation
the abovementioned initiative exemplifies the importance of cooperation express sees great value in working
with other transporters and logistics companies as well as its stakeholders such as commercial enterprises
towards a common solution for improving environmental performance cooperation is important to achieve global
sustainability goals however competition between companies on market share and sensitive business information
may slow down the sectors performance

longterm versus shortterm vision
in the current economic climate and amid the difficulties the company is facing in achieving its shortterm
objectives decisions that influence a longterm target such as managing the co2 efficiency are subject to debate
express continues to discuss these investment issues with internal and external stakeholders with an objective to
focus on the long term

co2 efficiency versus absolute co2 emissions
with its target to improve co2 efficiency express recognises that the absolute worldwide emissions must also be
reduced reducing absolute emissions is a difficult target to manage and has proved difficult to align with express
growth strategy improving co2 efficiency does not automatically lead to a reduction in absolute co2 emissions
business growth will result in more absolute co2 emissions as long as the increase in growth is outperforming the
co2 efficiency improvement therefore the relative co2 target should be at such an ambitious level that it will
impact the absolute co2 emissions as well

co2 footprint
the co2 footprint according to the greenhouse gas protocol can be reported in three categories to make a
comparison in the sector possible
 scope 1 covers all direct emissions generated by sources that are owned or controlled by the company such
   as operational vehicles aviation and heating
 scope 2 includes all emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the company and
 scope 3 refers to indirect emissions that are consequences of the companys activities but occur from sources
   not owned or controlled by the company

the absolute co2 footprint is shown in the greenhouse gas protocol table above it is based on a larger scope
than the co2 efficiency index scope additional categories for the greenhouse gas protocol are other
operational vehicles motorcycles forklifts airfeeders and shunters other aviation charter and passenger flights
company cars business travel by air and subcontractors these additional categories result in relatively low
absolute co2 emission with the exception of subcontractors

co2 footprint own operations and subcontractors
in 2010 51 of the total co2 emission own and subcontractors was related to road transport 46 was related
to air transport and 3 to buildings express is reliant on subcontractors in its business activities capturing the
data related to their activities is one of express biggest challenges in environmental reporting the subcontracted
co2 emission is calculated based on secondary indicators such as kilometres driven and costs because of the
unavailability of primary data fuel consumption of subcontracted activities in 2010 57 of express co2

the share of subcontracted activities in 2010 based on co2 emissions is 78 in road transport and 39 in air
transport both road and air transport co2 emissions relatively increased by 3 for own operations compared
with 2009 for air transport there is a significant increase of own absolute co2 emissions this is mainly caused by
the increase in longhaul flights

the objective of the company car policy is to improve the co2 efficiency of company cars this is supported by
selection criteria when choosing a new car fuel efficient company cars are promoted and a oneoff financial
incentive is provided when selecting a highly efficient company car in 2010 109 employees drove a company car
with a hybrid engine compared with 86 in 2009 increase of 27 the total number of company cars increased by
1 to 4438

express partly offsets co2 emissions of company cars and business travel by air for compensation of the 2010
co2 emissions 19 ktonnes of co2 will be offset for company cars in the netherlands and 36 ktonnes of co2 will
be offset for business travel by air booked with the preferred travel agency

air transport
a major part of the improvements in the co2 efficiency index are due to improved efficiencies in air transport 44
index points improvement improvements are derived from optimisation efforts like airport closures fleet resizing
and renewal and improved capacity utilisation

the improvement in network flights is largely driven by higher aircraft utilisation supported by high growth of
volumes in the air network

while the operations in the longhaul flights nearly doubled in terms of absolute co2 emissions and freight tonne
kilometres the co2 per freight tonne kilometre increased slightly the longhaul fleet in 2010 included a boeing
767 freighter which operated less efficient per freight tonne kilometre compared to the boeing 747 freighters
the underlying trend is positive driven by higher load factors and operational efficiency improvements in 2011
the introduction of three higher fuel efficient boeing 777 freighters will further improve the co2 efficiency of
longhaul aviation

at the end of 2010 express operated a fleet of 50 aircraft which can be separated into five operational categories
 european air network ean
 domestic
 longhaul intercontinental
 charter not included in the co2 efficiency index and
 passenger not included in the co2 efficiency index

all express own aircraft meet the international civil aviation organisation icao nox emission standard
caep6

as of 2012 aviation is included in the eu emission trading scheme eu ets the eu ets includes all flights
arriving at or departing from any eu airport and only covers co2 emissions express complies with eu ets and
monitors and reports data annually this data must be verified and sent to the competent authority by the end of
march starting in 2011

road transport
co2 efficiencies in road transport deteriorated which had a negative impact on the co2 efficiency index 16 index
points deterioration the efficiency indicator co2 per kilometre does not reflect all improvement efforts such as
better network optimisation and changes in capacity load factors express recognises that the efficiency indicator
needs to be improved to reflect network efficiencies properly

express uses small trucks and vans mainly for pickup and delivery operations and large trucks mainly for linehaul
operations the co2 efficiency of small trucks deteriorated slightly the number of small trucks and vans
increased from 6054 in 2009 to 7026 in 2010 more than 2 of this fleet is powered by alternative fuels

the number of large trucks mainly linehaul vehicles increased from 3865 in 2009 to 4408 in 2010 more than
1 of this fleet is powered by alternative fuels the co2 efficiencies of large trucks deteriorated mainly because
france and australia were brought into the reporting scope during 2010 which had a negative impact on the co2
efficiency index in road transport

buildings
the 26 index points improvement on buildings can be attributed to the implementation of carbon management
plans at country level and continued focus on energy management surveys lighting and control upgrades electrical
equipment replacement planned maintenance and sustainable electricity usage

in the future express intends to concentrate on continuously improving its energy efficiency during 2010 the new
tnt centre was under construction and employees will move into the new building in march 2011 this new head
office challenges the highest aspirations for sustainable development and will be completely co2 neutral the

express is fully committed to striking an appropriate balance between economic growth social development and
the environmental impact of its operations it continues to invest in reducing the noise impact of its operations and
fleet the express delivery schedule requires the operation of aircraft at nonstandard times particularly night
flights between 11 pm and 6 am express supports the international framework of a balanced approach to aircraft
noise management and is working with local and national authorities to promote this approach at eu airports

directive 200230ec known as the airport noise management directive was adopted in 2003 and establishes
rules and procedures with regard to introducing noiserelated operating restrictions at eu airports the directive
requires member states to follow the balanced approach to aircraft noise management of the international civil
aviation organisation member states should first identify the noise problem and then analyse the various
measures using four principles namely
 reduction of noise at source ie quieter aircraft
 land use planning and management around airports
 operating procedures and
 operating restrictions

express total received 11 noise complaints in 2010 compared with 25 in 2009 of these a significant proportion
is attributed to noise at depots in 2010 the united kingdom reported nine noiserelated complaints from local
neighbourhood communities to resolve the issue local management involved all the relevant parties

environmental incidents
within express total 20 onsite environmental incidents compared with 14 in 2009 and six offsite
environmental incidents compared with one in 2009 were reported in 2010 the majority of the environmental
incidents were caused by minor fuel leakages or spillages all of which were dealt with appropriately to prevent

customer satisfaction
express aims to exceed customer expectations analysis shows that satisfied and more than satisfied customers
are more loyal than the lower ranked customer groups therefore express aims to increase the percentage of
more than satisfied customers from within the group of at least satisfied customers understanding the mindset
of less than satisfied customers and using their feedback helps express to develop improvement strategies with
the goal of improving customer retention

express conducts an annual worldwide customer satisfaction survey in 2010 it received over 30300 completed
surveys from customers across all customer segments customer satisfaction meeting customer expectations
decreased from 936 in 2009 to 922 in 2010 however consistent with 2009 40 of customers rated
express services as exceeding expectations the overall decrease was seen across all customer classifications
certain key attributes fell more than others such as speed of answer and ease of contact yet both still score
above 90 in terms of meeting expectations a key part of the continuous improvement approach in 2011 is the
implementation of the lean improvement methodology within the countries to ensure that the stated view of the
customers drives improvement initiatives

subcontractors and suppliers
express acknowledges the significant ecological and social impact it has on its supply chain and suppliers local
communities as such express is committed to raising its social and ecological standards as well as those of
subcontractors and suppliers express also acknowledges that its overall footprint is larger than that resulting solely
from its own operations as transport subcontractors cause up to 57 of express total co2 footprint this is a
recognised challenge in improving express environmental and social performance

a distinction is made between subcontractors and suppliers subcontractors relate to providers of transport and
logistic services suppliers are providers of services and materials and other matters excluding transport and
logistic services

subcontractors
express works with its subcontractors in a proactive and innovative manner to deliver products and services and
encourages them to conduct their services in an environmentally friendly and socially responsible way

express expects all its subcontractors to be socially responsible and to act in accordance with all prevailing local
and international legislation as well as the tnt business principles express is committed to managing its
operations in a way that complies with all relevant sustainability legislation and standards

in 2010 express conducted a survey into subcontracted operations to help to improve the reliability of reported
cr information express invested in seeking new ways to work with its suppliers and subcontractors to improve
the reliability of reported cr information however due to the complexity of the subject express intends to
invest additional time in developing procedures for its subcontracted operations to reduce its subcontractors
social and environmental footprint

express believes that developing collaborative efforts within its industry is an effective way to leverage the work of
each individual company or organisation to raise supply chain standards the courier and mail sectors should work
together in setting consistent standards and support their subcontractors in implementing these standards more
persistently

for subcontractor road traffic fatal accident information express relies on subcontractors to report fatal accidents
involving their drivers and third parties due to legal obligations and the requirements of local authorities express
is unable to distinguish between blameworthy and nonblameworthy road traffic fatal accidents the majority of the
subcontractor fatal accidents in 2010 occurred in india brazil and china 14 out of 23 focused support has been
provided to india brazil and china as these countries present very specific road safety challenges continued focus
on implementing sustainable improvements and standards should produce positive results in the long term

suppliers
express has a large number of suppliers located around the world by actively engaging with these suppliers
express raises awareness of its corporate values express identifies and manages the impacts of the supply chain by
assessing the sustainability risks of suppliers and sharing best practices with them on mitigating these risks in 2011
express will further invest in seeking new ways to work with its suppliers to improve innovation and reliability of
reported cr information

voluntary contributions to society

express has been an active partner of the united nations world food programme wfp the worlds largest
humanitarian aid agency since 2002 by committing its knowledge skills and resources express supports wfp in
fighting hunger worldwide

hunger is the greatest global threat to health as it claims more lives each year than aids malaria and tuberculosis
combined approximately one billion people in the world are undernourished most of them women and children
a third of all child deaths in the developing world are linked to undernutrition in 2010 the wfp provided food aid
to over 90 million people in more than 70 countries

moving the world
express partners with the wfp in a programme known as moving the world mtw both parties benefit from this
partnership wfp benefits from the knowledge skills resources and donations provided by express and express
benefits from increased employee engagement and employee and management development additionally the
programme reinforces the express brand and value proposition

the partnership moving forward
at the end of 2009 express and wfp committed to take the partnership to new levels over the years wfps
mission has developed from food aid to food assistance reflected in the wfp strategic plan 2008  2011 which
required the partnership to progress to the next phase

evaluating the partnership after the first five years express concluded that the partnership and the mtw
programme have a strong connection to promoting express company values instilling pride in express employees
and expanding the express brand however the programme showed limited correlation with the goals of express
the result has been the development of a more strategic approach focused on sharing skills which is closer to
express objectives a flexible twoway approach will maximise synergies and have a positive impact on the depth
of the partnership on a local regional and global level mtws mission is to support wfp in achieving their strategic
objectives in more ways than simply donating cash

in 2010 total expenditure of mtw was over 4 million expenditure increased for contributions to learning and
development and decreased for general management and office operations compared with 2009 these changes
are the result of a transition period in 2009 due to structural changes in management which led to an increase in
the support of wfp operations a number of projects balady bread and client mapping projects ran for the entire
year

moving the world programme pillars
to reflect the new strategy the programme pillars have changed to
 sharing knowledge and skills
 emergency response
 advocacy and engagement and

sharing knowledge and skills
express is always looking for new ways to work towards a more sustainable future through its involvement in
various projects express shares its knowledge and business skills to support improvement in several areas

balady bread
the global account management business solution team the gam team completed a project within the
framework of the wfp partnership to develop a solution for the supply chain of subsidised balady or sourdough
bread in egypt express presented the government of egypt with a roadmap for a new balady bread system that
provides good quality bread in the right quantities to the right locations at significantly lower costs

in egypt every day 220 million loaves of subsidised bread are sold the bread is purchased daily by 56 million
egyptians the supply chain of balady bread is plagued with unnecessary high administrative costs wastage
leakages low bread quality and bad planning

the government of egypt and wfp asked the gam business solutions department to develop a solution for the
balady bread supply chain the project was split into several subprojects led by gam experts wfp staff and
assisted by national and international experts the gam team spent approximately 1700 hours to develop the
solution the optimised supply chain they designed is estimated to result in annual cost savings of 900 million for
the government of egypt

this project was a onceinalifetime opportunity to test and expand the express supply chain management skills
while at the same time improving the quality of life for millions of people

client mapping and interaction
wfp provides services to third parties through partnerships with either the united nations or various ngos it is
wfps objective to be the service provider of choice for the humanitarian community to be able to achieve that
objective a project has been defined that will support wfp in improving their service level express sponsored this
project by offering a fulltime project manager for six months in addition to support for a research agency this
project named client mapping and interaction mapped out wfps clients their needs and the method that wfp
should use to interact with them

this project was a good opportunity to translate express customer experience development skills to a
humanitarian context

global experience programme 2010
an important component of sharing knowledge and skills is investing in future generations the next generation
requires experience to make responsible choices as they will shape the future in order to offer students a unique
experience in sustainable decisionmaking express selected eight students after an intensive selection procedure
the students have been invited for a sixmonth humanitarian internship at fleet forum north star alliance and
wfp after an extensive preparation at wfp headquarters in rome in september 2010 the students left for the
gambia india nicaragua and tanzania this is the last global experience programme group as the programme will
be terminated due to the organisational changes at tnt

emergency response
express provides wfp with operational support by contributing skilled people who assist in humanitarian
emergencies within 48 hours express responds to requests from wfp to provide support in aviation
warehousing transportation reporting and communications for up to four to six weeks after the disaster a pool
of dedicated and speciallytrained employees has been formed as part of the emergency response commitment
since 2005 230 employees have been involved in 20 emergency response activities

2010 was an eventful year with express involved in major emergencies in haiti and pakistan adding up to more
than 14000 hours of support the support activities ranged from staff fleet and transport management to airside
support and customs clearance a total of two airlifts with a capacity totalling 230 metric tonnes of food items
were sponsored to go to haiti and pakistan the costs of these two airlifts were approximately 055 million

five employees were deployed in the haiti relief operations after the earthquake hurricane thomas and the
cholera outbreak

advocacy and engagement
as a result of the new strategy a shift from fundraising to advocacy and engagement has materialised raising
awareness of hunger engaging employees in the programme and conducting discussions regarding express support
to wfp triggers new support activities for the wfp these range from inkind support sharing knowledge and
skills in specialist projects to local advocacy events and fundraising

to engage more employees the twinning programme connecting wfp countries and express countries to
support the food for education programme by raising funds has been expanded it now includes inkind support to
the wfp twinning country offering more choice to employees on methods to support wfp and ensuring a
connection with the express business specialist projects using express knowledge and skills and emergency
response have been added and regional connections have been launched the first regional connection established
is between express france and wfp west africa fleet forum and north star alliance are also involved with the
twinning programme both offer a strong connection with express through road and fleet safety fleet management
and the reduction of the environmental impact of transportations and improvement of truck driver health

besides global projects numerous local initiatives have been initiated to raise awareness and financial support for
wfp in 2010 express employees raised 079 million for wfp

walk the world seeks to raise awareness of global hunger and to collect money for the wfp food for education
programme in 2010 130000 people walked in 157 locations in 58 countries raising enough funds to provide a
year of meals for 14600 school children

building partnerships
as an industry leader in cr express intends to establish and expand partnerships to support achievement of the
millennium development goals mdgs express plays an active role in involving other private sector companies
to join these partnerships to make them more sustainable and to encourage other private sector companies to play
a role in developing low and middleincome countries

fleet forum
fleet forum is a joint initiative of wfp the international federation of the red cross and red crescent societies
world vision international univicity care international and express

fleet forums mission is to focus on the role of road transport in low and middleincome countries as road
transport is a crucial enabler towards the achievement of the millennium development goals fleet forum aims to
make road transport safer and more efficient and concentrates on reducing the environmental impact of transport
in low and middleincome countries that are on the verge of transitioning into emerging markets

for express participating in fleet forum is important as it links directly to its core activities and often pertains to
countries where express has growing operations for example in india the country with the highest number of
road accidents fleet forum started a road safety project in 2010 at various locations in india fleet forum
trained management and staff of aid and development organisations such as the world health organisation and
unicef on how to change their behaviour to reduce the risk of being involved in a traffic accident in total fleet
forum trained more than 800 people through road safety awareness sessions and management workshops

fleet forum also supported these ngos as well as local express vendors with the implementation of a fleet safety
management structure the fleet safety management system developed by fleet forum with the support of large
commercial fleet operators such as express and shell aims to embed fleet safety within the culture of the
organisation

north star alliance
north star alliance the publicprivate partnership established by express and wfp in 2006 started off as a
practical industry response to an urgent health problem and has matured into a balanced approach that meets
industry public health and individual needs north star works at the crossroads of disease and mobility to ensure
that highlymobile populations especially long distance truck drivers and related communities have access to basic
health services through a network of health clinics called roadside wellness centres rwcs

corporate responsibility reporting criteria
the corporate responsibility cr data are prepared in accordance with the reporting criteria and guidelines of the
a application level of the global reporting initiative gri g3 and the gri logistics and transportation sector
supplement as far as relevant to express see annex 1 express is a signatory of the un global compact and
therefore reports on the 10 principles therein a bridge between the gri g3 indicators and the principles of the
un global compact is made in the gri g3 index in annex 1 in addition the 2003 aa1000 framework is used
for identification of stakeholders and integration of the stakeholder process in the reporting process definitions
used for key performance indicators kpis are defined in annex 3 kpis are selected on the basis of interactive
stakeholder dialogue and the issues relevant to express operations

cr data is gathered using a questionnaire all figures are based accordingly on the data provided by the reporting
entities in express innight and head office ho through the cr reporting and monitoring tool conversion
factors are taken from internationallyacknowledged organisations such as the intergovernmental panel on climate
change the international energy agency and the greenhouse gas protocol

corporate responsibility reporting scope
in accordance with tnts group policy on cr reporting all companies acquired in any given year are required to
report cr data as from the following year express entities that are divested full or partial sale whereby express
no longer retains a direct or indirect controlling interest are excluded from the cr reporting scope for the entire
year in which the divestment took place

where express selected is stated in this report it means express excluding huayuhengye logistics company
limited hoau lit cargo and expresso ara√ßatuba these entities are singled out because they are not in scope
for external assurance however these entities are included in the express total cr data for 2010 lit cargo in
chile and expresso ara√ßatuba in brazil were acquired in 2009 and so no data was available in 2009 with the
exception of fatal accidents

to enable readers to benchmark the 2010 cr data with the 2009 cr data the 2009 reported figures have been
restated india and brazil are now included in the 2009 express selected figures whereas these entities were
excluded last year from the 2009 express selected figures due to the restated 2009 scope the external
assurance provider is not able to provide reasonable assurance on the 2009 data in 2010 mail china was
transferred from mail to express and therefore the fullyear cr figures are included in the express selected figures
for both the reported 2009 and 2010 figures

figures are presented in a relative way using percentages and ratios to make it possible for readers to monitor
and measure progress yearonyear unless the reporting criteria require absolute figures to be disclosed figures
related to absolute co2 emissions are all extrapolated to reflect express unless stated otherwise extrapolation is
done on the basis of fte coverage or m2 co2 efficiency indicators are also presented relative to the baseline year
of 2007 to show progress made towards longterm objectives for co2 efficiency improvements express defines
coverage as the number of fulltime equivalents ftes working in entities that report data divided by the total
number of ftes the data clarification table in annex 2 shows the coverage per indicator express has taken all
reasonable steps to ensure that the cr information in this supplementary report is accurate

corporate responsibility assurance
external cr assurance process
express via tnt nv has engaged pricewaterhousecoopers accountants nv pwc to provide reasonable
assurance on certain cr metrics and limited assurance on all other cr metrics this assurance work is performed
in accordance with the assurance standard 3410n assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports as
drawn up by the professional body of dutch accountants royal nba

as part of the external assurance engagement pwc also makes use of the capacity of the internal audit department
of express pwc reviews the findings of all internal audit reports and meets regularly with the management of the
internal audit department to discuss any findings furthermore for selected entities pwc and the internal audit
department perform their assurance procedures jointly

express policy is to include acquired companies in the assurance scope three years after the year of acquisition
this policy is intended to ensure that these entities can develop their processes to report cr data to the high
standards required by express and to give them time to become sufficiently aligned with express operational and
other systems thanks to this approach india and brazil are now included in the 2010 assurance scope and the
following entities are excluded from the assurance scope in 2010

express objective is to obtain reasonable assurance on all key performance indicators in 2010 the assurance
scope was extended to include the health and safety indicators on serious accidents and lost time accidents the
co2 efficiency index itself is also included in the 2010 assurance scope

pwc provided reasonable assurance on the following indicators
 the number of employees and fulltime equivalents employed
 the percentage of express workforce at certified sites
 the number of workplace fatal accidents and road traffic fatal accidents excluding subcontractor fatal
  accidents
 the number of serious accidents
 the number of lost time accidents and the ratio of lost time accidents per 100 ftes
 the absolute co2 footprint of owned operations scope 1 and 2
 co2 efficiency index
 co2 efficiency of buildings
 co2 efficiency of fleet split into small trucks large trucks european air network flights including domestic
  flights and longhaul flights and
 the percentage of sustainable electricity

all data and graphs related to these indicators have been audited and are marked with a triangle  reasonable
assurance is obtained through audit work while other elements of the report have been reviewed review work
provides only limited assurance because exhaustive gathering of evidence is not required

internal control on cr reporting
an internal control framework has been designed for the cr reporting processes for the capture and reporting of
reliable cr data in 2010 the framework was implemented at head office level implementation of identified
internal controls at country level was initiated in 2010 and will be completed in 2011 an implemented internal
control framework will not only increase the reliability of cr data but will also enable pwc in its audits to rely
more on internal controls and reduce purely dataoriented audit activities

assurance report

to the board of management of tnt nv


report on the corporate responsibility chapters

engagement and responsibilities
as explained in chapter 9 corporate responsibility reporting and assurance we have been engaged by the board of
management of tnt nv tnt to examine the content of chapters 7 8 and 9 and the annexes in this
supplementary report hereafter referred to as cr chapters in which tnt renders account of the performance
of its express division related to corporate responsibility cr in 2010

our examination consisted of the following combination of audit and review procedures
 audit of all data and graphs related to the following key performance indicators
         the number of employees and full time equivalents employed
         the percentage of express workforce at certified sites
         the number of workplace fatal accidents and road traffic fatal accidents excluding subcontractor fatal
          accidents
         the number of serious accidents
         the number of lost time accidents and the ratio of lost time accidents per 100 fte
         the absolute co2 footprint of owned operations scope 1 and 2
         co2 efficiency index
         co2 efficiency of buildings
         co2 efficiency of fleet split into small trucks large trucks european air network flights including
          domestic flights and longhaul flights and
         the percentage of sustainable electricity
 review of all the other elements of the cr chapters not excluded from our assurance scope

the board of management of tnt is responsible for the preparation of the cr chapters we are responsible for
providing an assurance report on the cr chapters

reporting criteria
tnt developed its reporting criteria on the basis of the g3 guidelines of the global reporting initiative gri as
explained in chapter 9 corporate responsibility reporting and assurance these reporting criteria contain certain
inherent limitations which may influence the reliability of the information

the cr chapters do not cover the information for all entities of the express division as the cr chapters only
include data from express entities that are fullyowned or majorityowned and from those joint ventures where
express has a controlling interest with respect to cr detailed information on the reporting scope is given in
chapter 9 we consider the reporting criteria to be relevant and appropriate for our examination

for several indicators the cr chapters are not yet based on full coverage as intended by tnt per its reporting
criteria by including a data clarification table annex 2 the coverage of the cr chapters is clarified showing for
each indicator the number of ftes working in entities that report on that indicator as a percentage of total ftes
we believe that this limitation with regard to the completeness of the cr chapters and the reasons for it are
acceptable

scope and work performed
we planned and performed our work in accordance with dutch law including standard 3410n assurance
engagements relating to sustainability reports

audit procedures focus on obtaining reasonable assurance substantiated by sufficient and appropriate supporting
audit evidence the audited data are marked with a triangle  review procedures focus on obtaining limited
assurance which does not require exhaustive gathering of evidence therefore providing less assurance than audit
procedures consequently we report our conclusions with respect to the audit and review procedures separately
we believe these combined procedures fulfil a rational objective


                                                                                                                         134

section b corporate responsibility
chapter 9 corporate responsibility reporting and assurance continued


we do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and feasibility of prospective information such as targets
expectations and ambitions included in the cr chapters

audit procedures
with regard to the audited data among other things we have gathered audit evidence as follows
 performing an external environment analysis and obtaining insight into the industry relevant social issues
   relevant laws and regulations and the characteristics of the organisation
 assessing and testing the systems and processes used for data gathering consolidation and validation including
   the methods used for calculating and estimating results
 testing the setup existence and the effectiveness of the relevant internal control measures during the
   reporting period
 reconciling reported data to internal and external source documentation
 examining the existence and validity of certificates issued in respect of the management system standards which
   have been adopted by tnt and
 performing analytical procedures relation checks and detailed checks

review procedures
our most important review procedures were
 assessing the acceptability and consistent application of the reporting policies in relation to the information
   requirements of tnts stakeholders
 reviewing internal and external documentation to determine whether the information in the cr chapters is
   substantiated adequately
 validating and testing the model used for estimating the co2 emissions of subcontractors
 evaluating the overall presentation of the cr chapters in line with tnts reporting criteria and
 assessing the application level according to the g3 guidelines of gri

we believe that the evidence obtained from our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
conclusions

limitations in our examination
for comparative purposes tnt has restated the 2009 figures to include the information for express entities in
india and brazil because these entities were excluded from our assurance scope last year we do not provide
assurance on the 2009 comparative figures

the data from the following entities are excluded from our assurance scope huayu hengye logistics company ltd
hoau lit cargo and expresso ara√ßatuba this is adequately disclosed in chapter 9 we have accepted this
limitation in our scope because providing assurance on data from these acquired entities would not provide a
rational objective at this stage as express is still in the progress of integrating these entities into its business

conclusion

based on our audit procedures
in our opinion all data and graphs marked with a triangle as mentioned under engagement and responsibilities
are in all material respects presented reliably and adequately in accordance with tnts reporting criteria

based on our review procedures
with respect to the other elements of the cr chapters not excluded from our assurance scope nothing has come
to our attention that would cause us to conclude that the cr chapters in all material respects do not provides a
reliable and adequate presentation of the cr policy of tnt or of the cr related performance of its express
division during the reporting year in accordance with tnts reporting criteria

section b corporate responsibility




chapter10 risks
risk environment and response 20102011
the express business strategy and the supporting financial and corporate responsibility strategies are not without
risk all strategies automatically attract a certain level of execution risk and strong change management capabilities
are needed to manage these risks the board of management believes that these strategies contain manageable
execution risks as they are based on tnt express core strengths

in reviewing the business context and competitive position of its business express has concluded that the
economic outlook for 2011 is still uncertain and it continues to take a cautious view on shortterm economic
developments

express financial standing as per 31 december 2010 is solid and is based on a balanced and longterm secured
funding position in 2011 it will continue to focus on sustaining its good financial standing by among other things
strict business performance and cash flow management which will include continuous optimisation of working
capital and capital expenditures

specific key risks  short to mid term
the risks described in this chapter cover the risks pertaining only to the express businesses

understanding strategic operational compliance and financial risks is a vital element of express management
decisionmaking processes express risk management and control programme is not an end in itself but a process
to support management no matter how comprehensive a risk management and control system may be it cannot
be assumed to be exhaustive nor can it provide certainty that it will prevent negative developments in the business
and business environment from occurring or that its mitigating actions will be fully effective it is important to note
that new as yet unknown risks could be identified however any of the following known specific key risks could
have a material adverse effect on express financial position results of operations liquidity and the actual outcome
of matters referred to in the forwardlooking statements contained in this supplementary report for a full
description of tnt risk management internal control integrity and compliance framework and to view the board
of managements compliance statement see chapter 10 of the 2010 annual report of tnt nv

specific key risks in 2011

the board of management has reviewed express risk profile and confirms that the following specific key risks
pertinent to the express business require focused and decisive management attention in the short to mid term
either due to the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment increased political involvement andor
the execution of the short to mid term strategy

specific key risks 2011
sudden changes in customer preferences or shipping patterns due to eg macroeconomic changes could create the
need to further rationalise express operations and might negatively impact results such changes could lead to a
significant increase or decrease in volumes weight per consignment shifts between premium and economy
products and pressure on yield
although express has a significant proportion of its operational costs outsourced a risk still exists of sharp volume
fluctuations and shifts in customer preferences as a result of macroeconomic developments in particular the shift
in international volumes from premium nextday express to economy express products significantly impacts
operations and changes the profit profile where the premium product represents a relatively large share of
international consignments at a low 7 kg weight per consignment representing the majority of international
revenues economy products represent only a limited part of total consignments at 70 kg per consignment a sharp
premium or total volume decrease would only provide limited shortterm opportunities to cost adaptation in the
mostly fixed air network express continues however to reduce structural and variable costs in order to protect



                                                                                                                          136

section c risks
chapter 10 risks
margin and profit levels depending on the size and predictability of the fluctuations the profitability of express
would be significantly influenced if express is unable to keep up with the speed of onset of this risk

failure to prevent a terrorist attack andor increased antiterrorism requirements could impose substantial
additional security costs on express and could significantly impact express reputation
escalating concerns about global terrorism and perceived insufficient levels of aviation security which could result
in a successful terrorist attack have caused governments and airline operators around the world either to adopt or
contemplate adopting stricter disciplines that will increase operating costs for businesses including those in the
transportation industry for example in recent years the eu has increased aviation security regulations and
airports around the world have and continue to impose mandatory use of xray screening equipment and
enhanced screening methods it is not possible to fully determine the effect that these new rules or changed
policies will have on express cost structure or its operating results however it is reasonable to expect that these
enhanced rules and regulations or other future security requirements for air cargo carriers could impose material
costs that will have a direct impact on express

express may be unable to use commercial airlines as part of its linehaul needs due to increased regulatory pressure
on security
as a result of aviation security incidents in 2010 such as those reported in yemen and greece accompanied by
escalating concerns about global terrorism many governments have implemented additional emergency measures
for security on passenger aircraft and all cargo aircraft particularly cargo sent to the united states on non
passenger flights these emergency measures prevent certain types of goods from travelling on commercial
passenger airlines this restricts the movement of these goods to purely allcargo aircraft causing potential service
delays and increased costs

the above emergency measures are under review by various governments who hope to introduce new security
standards for implementation globally these new standards may directly or indirectly result in commercial
passenger airlines banning the carriage of cargo on passenger flights this would drastically limit express ability to
provide current levels of connectivity and service without significant investments

it is not possible to determine the extent of the development of the additional security measures or the impact
they would have on service revenue and cost even though the possibility of a complete ban is considered to be
low it is reasonable to expect that these enhanced security measures may result in partial bans by some airlines or
countries that may increase security costs and impact operations and service quality

the anticipated demerger of express from tnt nv is a complex process involving a significant number of
stakeholders and certain residual cross liabilities between the demerged legal entities will continue to exist
as part of the demerger process creditors may object and stakeholders may decide not to approve the demerger
failure of tnt nv to successfully complete the demerger within a reasonable time frame may cause distraction
to management retention issues and could give rise to a risk that tnt nv is not able to implement its stated
strategy in a timely way if the demerger is successfully completed certain residual liabilities such as those related
to the dutch pension scheme will remain for both express and tnt nv mail for those legal liabilities related to
the other entity that existed at the time of the demerger up to the value of the assets allocated to the entity at the
time of the demerger these residual cross liabilities based on dutch demerger legislation are secondary in nature
such that these liabilities arise when the other entity fails to settle these liabilities when they become due the
express business therefore has a residual risk for claims prior to the demerger date that are related to tnt nv

additional specific and inherent key risks

in addition to the specific key risks requiring focus and attention in 2011 the board of management has identified
other risks that require ongoing monitoring and management these additional risks are described below and have
been classified by the risk categories as defined by coso  erm and the categories also recommended by the
monitoring committee of the dutch corporate governance code the risks are further classified into specific
risks and inherent risks facing express specific risks are risks that the board of management believes could
negatively impact its short to mid term objectives while inherent risks are those risks that are constantly present
in the business environment but which are considered sufficiently material to require disclosure and management
the sequence in which these risks are presented in no way reflects any order of importance chance or materiality
the board of management believes that this approach remains a comprehensive and prudent method of disclosure




                                                                                                                           137

chapter 10 risks

strategic risks
specific strategic risks
the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may involve significant challenges including costs and could
adversely affect express revenues costs and profitability
express has entered into and will from time to time continue to enter into acquisitions express will strengthen its
business through limited acquisitions where appropriate with a focus on emerging markets emerging markets by
their nature contain higher levels of market and execution risk and expose express to uncertainty arising from the
stability of its emerging platforms

acquisition plans in express are supported by multiyear cash flow and profit projections identifying value creation
opportunities based on sustainable profitable growth the plans are carefully developed using the best possible
analysis and judgement the acquisition plans are discussed where appropriate with the supervisory board in
detail prior to approval these plans however are inherently uncertain in addition to market risks and
uncertainties that may have been overlooked or incorrectly forecast the plans contain risks at key stages in the
acquisition process which may not be mitigated to the full extent possible mitigation of acquisition risks in
emerging markets is particularly difficult due to the greater uncertainties of these markets uncertainties in the
acquisition process start with the risk that the optimum target might not be selected are followed by the risk that
the deal execution might minimise express exposure at the best price and end with the risk that the execution of
the integration might not achieve an optimal result

the integration of acquired businesses creates a requirement for change in both the acquired businesses and the
tnt organisation which leads to uncertainty the integration of the companies express has acquired normally
results in a significant challenge and changerelated costs this is particularly true in the context of an emerging
market where integration challenges are often significantly enhanced by cultural social and infrastructure factors
as well as more volatile markets and unstable governments the uncertainty and cultural differences as well as the
demands on management and resources to achieve the integration of the newlyacquired businesses result in a risk
that the integration of acquisitions is suboptimal in addition the nature of the emerging markets is such that it is
difficult to retain qualified management and staff in key positions this increases the risk that express growth
strategy may be delayed or may not be successfully achieved

if an existing or future integration effort is delayed or is not successful express may incur additional costs and lose
revenue with a resulting adverse effect on profitability the value of the investment in the acquired company may
decrease significantly and may be permanently impaired

express derives a significant portion of its revenues from its international operations and is subject to the risks of
doing business in emerging markets
express has significant international operations and while the geographical diversity of its international operations
helps ensure that it is not overly reliant on a single region or country express is continually exposed to changing
economic political and social developments beyond its control emerging markets are typically more volatile than
mature markets and any downturn in these markets is typically more pronounced than those in the developed
world a downturn in these markets could negatively impact express revenues and adversely affect the business
financial position and operations

changes in market conditions andor relationships with joint venture partners may require express to revise its
strategies which could adversely affect its profitability
changes in market conditions may lead express to revise the strategies in which joint ventures are concluded
revised strategies may lead express to demerge these businesses or terminate these joint ventures the resulting
employment reduction or other significant restructuring costs could impact express profitability

measures taken to reduce costs including employee redundancies may be delayed andor may not achieve the
results intended and could adversely affect express reputation revenues and profitability
the cost saving targets and initiatives are based on assumptions and expectations that may not be valid
restructuring of operations and other costreducing measures may not achieve the results intended and may incur
restructuring and other costs and charges to express in addition restructuring costs are based on expectations
about for example the voluntary leave of employees if those expectations are not valid this may incur additional
restructuring cost all these changes from expectations on savings and restructuring costs will affect express
profitability




                                                                                                                            138

section c risks
chapter 10 risks
the loss of key suppliers particularly in the subcontractor and commercial linehaul sectors due to insolvency or
bankruptcy in a worsening macroeconomic environment or significant further decline in volumes could have a
significant impact on express cash flows and operational capabilities
express business model is dependent upon the extensive use of subcontractors and other key suppliers
bankruptcy of key subcontractors and other suppliers could result in operational disruption and express ability to
offer its full range of delivery solutions

express may decide to exit certain businesses or markets in the future which could result in additional costs
related to closure of operations impairment of goodwill or other contractual liabilities
in the future express may choose to change its strategy and either fully or partially exit certain businesses or
markets due to for example to changes in strategic focus unattractive market conditions aggressive competitor
pricing policies or other protectionist behaviour by governments a full or partial exit could result in additional
costs due to the closure of operations the impairment of goodwill and other contractual liabilities

intensifying competition in the express market may put downward pressure on prices and could have an adverse
effect on express revenues and profitability
express competes with many companies and services on a local regional european and international level
express competitors include the incumbent postal operators of other nations in europe asia australia and the
united states motor carriers express companies logistics service providers freight forwarders air couriers and
others express expects competition to intensify in the future in all its core business areas targeted aggressive
actions by competitors may negatively impact prices express vision 2015 strategy focuses on a differentiated
product and price approach and the quality of services related to price rather than on price discounts
nevertheless increased competition may force down prices for express services and thus cause its revenues and
profitability to decrease

operational risks
specific operational risks
express operations and earnings are subject to risks related to the impact of natural disasters extreme weather
events and climate change regulation
in april 2010 express operations were impacted by the closure of european air space following the volcanic
eruption in iceland during this time express was able to curtail the impact on the business by switching networks
from air to road thus maintaining service across europe the risk of similar future events is impossible to predict
and tnt continues to invest in continuity plans to address these events as and when they arise

in the final weeks of 2010 operations were significantly disrupted by extreme adverse weather conditions that
closed many airports across northern and western europe created significant delays in both air and road
operations and impacted both revenue and earnings in 2010

global concern about climate change could lead to governmental actions andor regulations that require the
company to improve the management of emissions from its air and road fleet as such there is a risk to future
operations and a compliance risk for existing facilities and express fleet if express is not able to demonstrate
adequate emissions management realisation of these risks could have an adverse impact on operational
performance and express financial position

at a national regional and global level climaterelated regulation remains uncertain with various levels of maturity
an amendment in the regulatory environment that affects express stems from the inclusion of the aviation sector
in the eu emission trading system eu ets effective as of january 2011 at present there are no regulations
driven by climate considerations which directly affect express road transport activities however many local
governments are imposing regulations to limit both the volume of vehicular traffic and emissions associated with
inner city distribution a comprehensive analysis of express fleet has revealed that exposure to this risk is limited
due to the high environmental performance of the current fleet the most significant risk identified stems from
express subcontracted operations the express management board is developing corrective actions to mitigate
this risk express is also reassessing its business model for the possible introduction of carbon pricing and continues
to test new technologies that can help continue to make its operations cleaner

rising fuel and energy prices as a result of climate regulation and depletion of resources will also affect express
profitability increases in fuel prices as a direct consequence of climate regulation are expected to be limited in the
foreseeable future they are currently mainly driven by market forces electricity prices may see further increases
as a result of more stringent regulation of power utilities under the eu ets scheme with its cr strategy and
initiatives express aims to continuously improve the carbon efficiency of its operations and to use nonfossil

energy sources wherever feasible in this way express addresses the risk of increased prices for fossil fuel or
energy sources

express depends on a number of infrastructure facilities for which tnt has limited or no comparable backup
facilities in the event of operational disruptions at one or more of these facilities express revenues profitability
and business operations would be affected
a portion of express infrastructure is concentrated in single locations for which there are either limited or no
comparable backup facilities or very expensive backup scenarios in the event of a disruption of operations an
example of this is its air express hub in li√®ge belgium the operation of express facilities is prone to a number of
risks including power failures the breakdown failure or substandard performance of equipment the possibility of
work stoppages or civil unrest natural disasters catastrophic incidents such as aeroplane crashes fires and
explosions and normal hazards associated with operating a complex infrastructure if there were to be a significant
interruption of operations at one or more of express key facilities and operations could not be transferred or
could only be transferred at very high costs to other locations express might not meet the needs of its customers
and business and operating results would be adversely affected

impacts from climate change may affect this infrastructure and could potentially disrupt express services
furthermore express employees living in riskprone areas could potentially be affected by extreme weather
events although express has operations in geographical areas that are more susceptible to the potential
consequences of climate change the direct implications for express operations are expected to be limited in the
short to mid term

incidents resulting from the transport of hazardous materials and confidential consignments or a major incident
involving sorting centres warehousing facilities and air or road fleet may adversely affect express revenues
profitability reputation and share price
express transports hazardous materials for a number of customers in the automotive biomedical and chemical
industries the hazardous consignments include airbags batteries paint blood samples medical substances dry ice
and chemicals express may also transport hazardous or dangerous goods without notification of the nature of the
goods transported express faces a number of risks by transporting these materials such as personal injury or loss
of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage incidents
involving these materials could result from a variety of causes including sabotage terrorism accidents or the
improper packaging or handling of the materials

in addition express transports confidential and sensitive consignments on behalf of some of its customers express
does not always know the confidential and sensitive nature of these consignments and customers may choose to
enter consignments into express network without registering the consignment with the result that they cannot be
tracked and traced

if a significant incident occurred involving the handling of hazardous materials or if confidential consignments were
misplaced or lost express operations could be disrupted and the company could be subject to a wide range of
additional measures or restrictions imposed on it by local or government authorities as well as potentially large civil
and criminal liabilities this could negatively affect express revenues and profitability a significant incident
particularly a wellpublicised incident involving potential or actual harm to members of the public could also
damage express reputation

as an owner and operator of a large air and road fleet express is involved in activities that expose the company to
liability in the case of a major air or road incident not only for employees facilities and thirdparty property but
also for the general public an incident involving express aircraft or vehicles could cause significant loss of life and
property and could adversely affect express revenues profitability reputation and share price

express may not accurately forecast future infrastructure requirements which could result in excess or insufficient
capacity and negatively affect express revenues and profitability
in order to maintain market position and future growth express must make ongoing investments in infrastructure
such as aircraft trucks and depots infrastructure investments are based on forecasts of future capacity
requirements forecasts for future requirements might not be accurate since they are based on a large number of
factors including factors beyond the direct control of management and in particular the changing macroeconomic
conditions and changes in governmental regulation as a consequence there may be a mismatch between
investment and actual requirements if express underestimates its future capacity requirements customer needs
may not be met and express could lose business market share revenues and profits if express overestimates
future needs or if major contracts are cancelled by customers it may experience costly excess capacity and this
could adversely affect profitability

express reputation could be negatively impacted by increased fatalities as a result of road traffic accidents
express operates a transparent policy of reporting all accidents that result in fatal injuries as part of its
comprehensive corporate responsibility programme it is evident that in spite of significant investment in health and
safety driver training and awareness the number of accidents that result in fatalities continues to be an issue
express acquisitions in emerging markets have seen a significant increase in the number of such accidents adverse
weather conditions as well as a general increase in road traffic have also contributed to this going forward
continued focus on embedding and sustaining the express health and safety management system will be enforced by
management but there remains a risk that express reputation could be damaged if an increase in fatal accidents
occurs in both express mature and emerging platforms

inherent operational risks
express faces risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases including pandemic
influenza
another global pandemic of influenza like the pandemic of influenza type ah1n1 declared by the world health
organisation on 11 june 2009 could adversely affect express business these outbreaks of contagious diseases and
other adverse public health developments would have a material adverse effect on express business operations
they could impact express ability to ship consignments or otherwise make deliveries of products originating in
affected countries as well as causing temporary closure of offices or other facilities such closures or shipment
restrictions could severely disrupt express business operations and adversely affect its financial condition and
results of operations since 2006 express has implemented measures to develop written preventive procedures
and contingency plans to mitigate the effects of any future outbreak of pandemic influenza and other epidemics but
the epidemiology of the current virus and the reactions of local national and regional governments are difficult to
gauge which could mean that the current plans do not address all possibilities

strikes work stoppages and work slowdown by express employees and the terms of new collective labour
agreements could negatively affect its revenues and profitability
the success of express business is dependent upon avoiding strikes work stoppages and work slowdown by
express employees industrial action by large trade unions or even relatively small yet key groups of employees
could seriously disrupt express operations industrial action may occur for reasons unrelated to collective labour
agreements with a particular trade union or group of employees for example express employees may refuse to
cross picket lines established by other trade unions of other companies if a strike work stoppage or work
slowdown occurs and express revenues and profitability could be adversely affected

express business may be negatively affected by the terms of collective labour agreements that express concludes
with its employees these terms could include increases in compensation and employee benefits less flexible work
processes and conditions than those of express competitors limitations on future workforce reductions and other
factors that make express workforce less mobile express profitability could suffer if express is not able to
conclude collective labour agreements on satisfactory terms with its employees

a significant privacy breach could adversely affect express business and it may be required to increase spending on
data security
the provision of service to express customers and the operation of its network involve the storage and
transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of
customers employees and others breaches in physical andor logical security could expose express its customers
or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability
for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential customers damage to the express brand and
reputation or disruptions in operations in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing
further data protection measures could be significant

investigations into the transportation sector relating to antitrust regulations including regulations dealing with
price fixing and other anticompetitive behaviour could result in express having to cooperate with governments
andor regulators as part of an industrywide process and if express were found to have acted in breach of these
laws fines and other administrative sanctions could be imposed
recent investigations into price fixing andor anticompetitive behaviour by some companies may result in an
increased focus on the transportation sector by regulators the company may be required from time to time to
cooperate with law enforcement agencies in various jurisdictions as part of a wider industry investigation such
actions could distract management from the daytoday running of the business and could also negatively impact
express reputation by association

legal and regulatory risks
specific legal and regulatory risks
express is exposed to various global and local legal and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse effect on
the results of operations and on express revenues and profitability
express operates around the globe and provides a worldwide service with facilities in many countries as a result
the company is confronted with complex legal and regulatory requirements in many jurisdictions usually of a
protectionist nature these include tariffs trade barriers limitations on foreign ownership of assets and share
capital and requirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments in many of the
jurisdictions in which express operates in particular emerging markets such as china india brazil russia and the
middle east aspects of the developing legal system including express inability to enforce contracts the absence of
an independent and experienced judiciary and similar factors such as the necessity to use nominee constructs
create an uncertain environment for investment and business activity these risks and complexities will increase in
the pursuit of the strategic objectives to expand operations to new markets express overall success as a global
business depends in part on its ability to succeed in different economic social political and legal conditions
express may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in the locations
where express business is conducted failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on business operations
and on express revenues and profitability

express is in the business of transporting goods that are subject to specific restrictions and regulations
express provides transportation services to many different industry sectors and countries some of which may be
subject to specific export controls customs regulations disclosures and denied parties regulations in addition
express is occasionally required to provide information requested by government organisations that are
investigating carriage of certain restricted or regulated consignments to and from certain denied or restricted
parties the complex systems it and controls applied by express may be insufficient to ensure all consignments
comply with applicable regulations in all jurisdictions this can lead to investigations and operational measures that
can impact operations and could adversely affect revenues and profitability in case of any violations of applicable
rules of regulations express may be subject to fines and other administrative sanctions as well as contractual
liabilities

inherent legal and regulatory risks
unfavourable decisions by competition authorities concerning joint ventures acquisitions or divestments could
restrict express growth strategic progress profitability and ability to compete in the market for express services
as part of its strategy express occasionally seeks alliances with or acquires shares in companies or seeks to divest
part of its business any approval of a joint venture an acquisition or divestment of shares or a business by
competition authorities may contain certain restrictions or conditions with respect to the intended transaction

expess may be unable to implement a transaction as contemplated to be in compliance with any restrictions or
conditions imposed by the directorate general of competition of the european commission or national
competition authorities these restrictions or conditions may negatively affect express revenues and profitability
if express is unable to implement a foreseen transaction under the restrictions or conditions applicable or if the
intended transaction is prohibited the company may be unable to develop alternative approaches this would have
an adverse effect on express ability to execute its strategy or focus on the companys core business

compliance with regulations and the securing of effective flight slot times may result in significant changes to the
companys operations and could limit express flexibility in operating its business and negatively affect costs and
profitability
express is subject to a wide variety of complex and stringent aviation transportation environment employment
and other laws and regulations in the netherlands the eu and the other jurisdictions where it operates existing
regulations are subject to constant revision and new regulations are constantly being adopted the interpretation
and enforcement of such laws and regulations vary and could limit express ability to provide its services in certain
markets it is uncertain whether existing laws and regulations or future regulatory judicial and legislative changes
will have a material adverse effect on express whether national or international regulators competition authorities
or third parties will raise material issues with regard to compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and
regulations or whether other regulatory activities will have a material adverse effect on express business revenues
and profitability

express operates various types of aircraft throughout europe and between europe and asia as a result express is
required to comply with a wide variety of international and national laws and regulations in some of the markets in
which express operates regulations have been adopted or proposed which impose nighttime takeoff and
landing restrictions aircraft capacity limitations and similar measures in order to address the concerns of local
communities express relies on nighttime operations at its air express hub in li√®ge belgium for a substantial part

of its international express business a curtailment of nighttime takeoffs and landings at any of express key
facilities such as li√®ge would likely harm business

in addition as the provider of timesensitive delivery services express needs to secure adequate and effective flight
slot times from airport coordination or other local authorities in all the countries and airports express operates
into and out of the timing or limited availability of these slots could have an impact on the efficient operations of
the express timesensitive air and road networks and could result in penalties for failing to meet the companys on
time delivery service commitments or increased costs in the event that express is obliged to purchase slots from
third parties to maintain its service levels

some governments have imposed stringent new security measures on air carriers that could result in additional
operating costs express failure to comply with these measures or the costs of complying with existing or future
government regulation could negatively affect revenues and profitability in addition existing or future regulation
on transport of goods may negatively affect express ability to perform services to meet customer needs or may
increase the costs of providing these services

the legal concept of limited liability for loss of or damage to goods carried by express is increasingly being
challenged and this may result in increased exposure to claims
express transports goods under the conditions of the international conventions regarding the carriage of goods by
air the warsaw convention and by road the convention on the contract for the international carriage of
goods by road these conventions contain provisions that limit express liability in the event that express loses
or damages shipments belonging to its customers in the past this principle was generally accepted as normal
business practice but in recent years courts and regulators in an increasing number of jurisdictions are more
sympathetic to allegations of gross negligence or lack of due care thereby setting aside the principles of limited
liability this trend exposes express to more and increased loss and damage claims express has covered this
additional exposure in its insurance arrangements however if this trend continues it could definitely result in
significantly higher insurance costs and thus in increased financial exposure and so adversely affect express
profitability

determination that subcontractors are to be considered express employees could affect express current business
model causing operating expenses to rise and net income to suffer
in various jurisdictions express uses subcontractors to perform aspects of its operations such as picking up and
delivering parcels as is common practice in the transportation industry in certain jurisdictions the authorities
have brought criminal andor civil actions alleging that subcontractors or their employees engaged by express are
to be regarded as express own unregistered employees if these allegations were upheld by a court the company
would incur in addition to criminal sanctions costs such as social security contributions wage taxes and overtime
payments in respect of such employees subcontractors could also bring civil actions seeking the reclassification of
subcontractor relationships in employment contracts if these actions were successful operating expenses would
rise and net income would suffer

employee and even subcontractor and supplier misconduct could result in financial losses the loss of clients and
fines or other sanctions imposed by the national and local governments and other regulators of the countries in
which express does business
express has implemented a robust integrity programme intended to protect it against risks relating to fraud and
other improper activities however notwithstanding its integrity programme the company may be unable in all
cases to prevent its employees from engaging in misconduct fraud or other improper activities that could
adversely affect express business and reputation misconduct could include the failure to comply with applicable
laws or the tnt business principles a breach of confidentiality or breach of contract with clients as a result of
employee misconduct express could incur fines and penalties imposed by governments in the countries in which it
does business furthermore express customers could file claims andor terminate the contract for breach thereof
any such fines penalties or claims could depending on their magnitude lead to adjustments to the financial
statements and result in liabilities that could reduce profitability in addition negative publicity in relation to
employee misconduct could negatively affect express reputation harm its ability to recruit employees and
managers and reduce revenues

similar risks apply with regard to misconduct by express subcontractors and suppliers in recent years courts
and regulators have increasingly held companies liable for acts of their independent subcontractors and suppliers
in view of this trend express has among other things communicated the tnt business principles to its
subcontractors and suppliers and is providing training to help ensure compliance however notwithstanding such
communication and training activities express may nevertheless experience potential liabilities in connection with
its subcontractors and suppliers activities under certain circumstances if those subcontractors and suppliers

financial risks
specific financial risks
express ordinary shares have not been previously listed and are subject to market fluctuations
the price of express ordinary shares may be volatile in the initial period because the supply of and demand for
express ordinary shares need to stabilise the share price may also be materially affected by a number of factors
including factors relating to the 299 shareholding by tnt nv mail and factors specific to express its
competitors and the express services industry

a downgrade in credit rating of express may increase financing costs and harm its ability to finance operations and
acquisitions which could negatively affect revenues and profitability
a downgrade in express credit rating may increase its financing costs and harm its ability to finance its operations
and acquisitions which could negatively affect revenues and profitability developments and trends in the global
economy can have a material adverse effect on the financial condition andor results of operations and cash flows
which may in turn result in a downgrade in credit ratings such deterioration may for example be impacted by
developments and trends in the global economy due to the demerger express needs to apply for its own
independent credit ratings express is currently in the process of applying for such separate credit ratings which
are expected to be completed before the contemplated demerger date

express is exposed to currency and interest rate fluctuations that could have an adverse effect on its financial
condition and results as well as on the comparability of express financial statements
parts of express total revenues and operating expenses as well as assets and liabilities are denominated in
currencies other than the euro the main sensitivities on revenues can be derived from geographical segmentation
as provided in the additional notes to the financial statements

in 2010 for example around 46 of revenues and around 38 of asset book value were held in countries outside
the euro zone as express expands its international operations it can be expected that an even greater portion of
its revenues costs assets and liabilities will be denominated in noneuro currencies the exchange rates between
these currencies and the euro may fluctuate substantially as a result currency fluctuations could have a material
adverse effect on express results and financial condition in any given reporting period and may affect the
comparability of express financial statements from period to period

the board of management has adopted and approved a policy that requires all express companies to manage their
foreign exchange risk against the functional currency express companies are required to hedge material balance
sheet exposures via the use of foreign exchange derivatives with the treasury department whereby a financing
company operated by the treasury department as inhouse bank trades these foreign exchange derivatives back
toback with external banks

currency exposures can be evaluated at revenue earnings and balance sheet level

at present no net investment hedges are outstanding however significant acquisitions and local debt are usually
funded in the currency of the underlying assets these form a natural hedge against foreign currency cash flow and
earnings risks

part of express borrowings and financial assets incur floating interest rates these floating interest rates may
fluctuate substantially and could have a material adverse effect on express results and financial condition in any
given reporting period

it is company policy to limit the maximum interest cost exposure over a sevenyear period as a specific percentage
of ebitda with a statistical 95 level of confidence

although express generally enters into hedging arrangements and other contracts in order to attempt to reduce its
exposure to currency and interest fluctuations these measures may be inadequate or may subject express to
increased operating or financing costs

a decline in the value of the euro could reduce the value of any indirect investment in express and any dividends
received
since its introduction on 1 january 1999 the value of the euro relative to the us dollar has fluctuated widely
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro will affect the dollar equivalent of the euro
price of the future express eurodenominated shares express nonlisted american depositary receipts adrs
and the us dollar value of any cash dividends if the value of the euro relative to the dollar declines the market
price of future express adrs is likely to be adversely affected any decline in the value of the euro would also
adversely affect the us dollar amounts received by shareholders on the conversion of any cash dividends paid in
euros on express future adrs

in more general terms if an investor has a functional currency other than the euro their investment expressed in
their own functional currency is similarly exposed to a decline of the euro against that other currency

changes in markets useful lives of assets and express business plans have resulted and may in the future result in
substantial impairments of the carrying value of assets thereby reducing net income
regular review of the carrying value of assets including intangible tangible and financial fixed assets may in the
future require express to recognise additional impairment charges among other things events in the markets
where express conducts its businesses including current trading macroeconomic developments significant
declines in stock prices market capitalisations and credit ratings of market participants as well as express ongoing
review and refinement of its business plans are elements included in these regular reviews in addition express
recognises increased depreciation and amortisation charges if it is determined that the useful lives of express fixed
assets are shorter than originally expected

inherent financial risks
the multinational nature of express business could expose the company to uncertainty in effective tax planning
and regulatory reviews and audits
multinational companies of express size are exposed to varying degrees of uncertainty related to tax planning and
regulatory reviews and audits express accounts for its income and other taxes on the basis of its own internal
analyses supported by external advice express continually monitors its global tax position and whenever
uncertainties arise assesses the potential consequences and either accrues the liability or discloses a contingent
liability in its financial statements depending on the strength of the companys position and the resulting risk of
loss

with regard to the key risks as mentioned and other risks express insurance policy is based on the conservative
approach of retaining frequency losses selfinsured and transferring catastrophe exposures to the insurance
market
as frequency losses such as cargo and vehicle claims are of an operational and customer service nature express
believes that selfinsurance is the best method to motivate operational units to address the underlying causes of
these losses express total selfinsured frequency claims are structured via an inhouse captive insurance company
and capped on an annual basis via reinsurance in 2010 express total annual retention cap on these losses was
55 million

express catastrophe exposures are insured in the traditional insurance markets these include aviation property
and business interruption general liability fraud and director and officers liability insurance express has a strict
policy to transfer risks only to insurers with a rating of a or higher and this is monitored on an ongoing basis

attention is being given to adjusting express insurance protection to address the everchanging legal and
regulatory environment in which it operates and all insurance policies are therefore tailormade to express unique
requirements current insurance arrangements also need to support strategic developments and the changing risk
profile of express
