in generating electricity from natural gas from the earlier level of 38 to 55
today as a result we now need onethird less natural gas to produce the
same amount of electricity


why did ogk2 choose siemens as its partner for this project 
denis bashuk  we first started thinking about repowering the turbine unit
around 2004 there were various technical possibilities and several companies
submitted interesting offers for turnkey solutions one argument in favor of
siemens was that its gas turbines fit in perfectly with our modernization
concept a high degree of operational reliability was also important to us and
 we were impressed with siemens very good references in this respect in
 previous years siemens had built more than a hundred similar turbines
 which were consistently praised by their operators


you trust us so much that ogk2 has commissioned
siemens to service unit 6 until 2025
denis bashuk  yes thats in line with our philosophy we prefer it when the
original manufacturer takes responsibility for maintaining and servicing its
systems our contract with siemens is for twelve years and were confident
that we wont have any problems with service and maintenance during this
time


what impact is the upgrade of unit 6 having on the
environment 
denis bashuk  a very positive one since the power plant now utilizes natural
gas much more efficiently than before weve substantially lowered our emis
sions of carbon dioxide and nitric oxide whats more we no longer need to
burn heavy oil as well in order to generate electricity unfortunately that used
to be the case particularly during peak load times in the autumn and winter in
the winter of 20122013 just a few months after the upgrade was completed
we were able to dispense with the use of heavy oil for the first time ever


as the general manager of a major power plant operator
in russia how do you see the sustainable energy mix of
the future 
denis bashuk  to achieve a sustainable energy mix in the european part of our
country we need to keep improving our efficiency in burning fossil fuels the
best way to do that is to convert our older steam power plants into advanced
combined cycle power plants weve only recently begun to use this technol
ogy in russia new and upgraded combined cycle power plants are also my
preferred solution for meeting the growing demand for electricity in russia
while minimizing the consumption of primary energy


what is ogk2 planning in this regard 
denis bashuk  were truly impressed with the results of siemens upgrade of
 unit 6 at kirishi at the moment ogk2 is building two new units at the
 cherepovets and serov power plants using combined cycle turbines from
  siemens for both projects and the construction of a third unit is in the
planning phase




                                                                                    19

same operation costs less than us4000 we can provide the operation at        200000
that price because labor costs in india are lower and because we work much
more productively than our colleagues in the west in india heart surgeons
perform an average of more than 600 operations a year  in some cases up
to six times the number performed by their counterparts in other countries
our advanced medical technology solutions from siemens and our optimized
it infrastructure are further key factors


what are the challenges facing healthcare in india
dr naresh trehan our situation  like so many others in india  is paradoxical
         1h
on the one hand we have outstanding hospitals that attract large numbers
of patients from abroad india has taken a leading position here and im
naturally very pleased about that but on the other hand even though our

those in rural areas
      1   based on the installed base of siemens imaging products and their typical utilization
          weve also taken into account the number of invitro tests worldwide divided by the

dr naresh trehan i have a high regard for the quality of the companys medical
pressures
systems and its services its unbeatable were 100 certain that siemens
products wont let us down i also have a high regard for the companys char
acter when siemens wants to sell us something they send one person but
when its a question of providing services they send us four and i appreciate
that very much in addition the company gives us opportunities to cooperate
in joint research projects in order to develop technologies that meet our
requirements  also in terms of cost

healthcare isnt that a contradiction                                             from all across india and outside
                                                                                    the country
dr naresh trehan in the us a coronary artery bypass operation costs about
us40000 in europe the figure is around us25000 at medanta the
same operation costs less than us4000 we can provide the operation at
that price because labor costs in india are lower and because we work much
more productively than our colleagues in the west in india heart surgeons
perform an average of more than 600 operations a year  in some cases up
to six times the number performed by their counterparts in other countries
our advanced medical technology solutions from siemens and our optimized
it infrastructure are further key factors


what are the challenges facing healthcare in india
dr naresh trehan our situation  like so many others in india  is paradoxical
on the one hand we have outstanding hospitals that attract large numbers
of patients from abroad india has taken a leading position here and im
naturally very pleased about that but on the other hand even though our
 services cost only about a tenth or a twentieth of what they do in the west
 theyre still not affordable for the majority of indias people  particularly
 those in rural areas


what are you doing to master this challenge
dr naresh trehan at medanta weve made worldclass medical treatment
affordable for more people and weve launched the healthy and educated
village program to foster healthcare and medical expertise outside the cities
 were training personnel to provide medical treatment and education in villages
 and we operate a mobile clinic to serve rural areas siemens has provided us
 with cancer diagnostic equipment we use it to examine people in rural areas
 free of charge and refer them when necessary to local hospitals in my opin
 ion access to medical services in india has improved considerably in the last
 five years im confident that within the next ten years well be providing up
 to 50 more patients with access to highquality healthcare


why did you decide to partner with siemens
dr naresh trehan i have a high regard for the quality of the companys medical
systems and its services its unbeatable were 100 certain that siemens
products wont let us down i also have a high regard for the companys char
acter when siemens wants to sell us something they send one person but
when its a question of providing services they send us four and i appreciate
that very much in addition the company gives us opportunities to cooperate
in joint research projects in order to develop technologies that meet our
requirements  also in terms of cost

     dr namrata gaur is full of enthusiasm for                        job my father was a doctor and i saw how
     her challenging profession although she                          his patients respected him for his compas
     continually faces new challenges one of                          sion and commitment from him i learned
     her major concerns is the growing number                          that nothing is more rewarding than help
     of cardiovascular patients the incidence of                     ing people relieving their pain and en

     and our patients are getting younger all                          popular doctor needs a lot of strength

     for treating cardiovascular disease in the                        i also convey the idea that we need to do
     years ahead despite growing prosperity                          more to promote the health of women
     there are still huge social disparities in the                    and children in india thats why shes so

professor denkena  the problems are usually at the interfaces  from product
design simulation and planning to the operation or programming of the
machine tools to the actual production siemens maps endtoend process
chains for its products and in my opinion thats a key prerequisite for success


one of your current research projects focuses on the
production and implantation of patientspecific prosthetics
whats your vision 
professor denkena  our vision is to implement production processes directly on
site  that is we want to precisely manufacture components under sterile
conditions as close as possible to the operating room  when for example an
implant has to be replaced or a tumor removed you only see what the situa
tion really is when an operation is underway siemens is on the right track

     end to end what are the obstacles here

professor denkena  the problems are usually at the interfaces  from product
design
 4      simulation and planning to the operation or programming of the
machine tools to the actual production siemens maps endtoend process
chains for its products and in my opinion thats a key prerequisite for success


one of your current research projects focuses on the
production and implantation of patientspecific prosthetics
whats your vision 
professor denkena  our vision is to implement production processes directly on

to identify the best options for the rest of the process under the
professor denkena  unfortunately these things always take longer than they
given conditions and the impact their implementation would have
should thats been our experience anyway regulatory approval always plays
on the development and production steps taken so far
a big role in the healthcare field so i wouldnt be surprised if it took at least
ten years i hope it wont take that long but its difficult to make predictions
such flexible optimized manufacturing processes will slash time
in any event im convinced that siemens has made a very important advance
tomarket for example by speeding up the construction of produc
since the process youve developed may provide many patients with better
tion facilities theyll also make it possible to manufacture product
prosthetics and thus enhance their quality of life
variants and even single customized products easily and at low
cost the siemens solution described in this report  which demon
strates the advantages of lean customized production in the area
of surgical prosthetics  is one good example of how this approach
will work another is our electronics factory in amberg germany
where our engineers simulate and optimize production processes 
including the control of entire factories  and adapt them to current
conditions when developing new products and while production is
already underway

what role do you think the individualized mass production                              roughly 70 researchers focus on
                                                                                       production processes mechatronic

professor denkena  our whole society is aging whats more many people want
                                                                                      by a siemens sinumerik system
to remain mobile and active as they grow older thats why implants can               produces an implant
enhance the quality of life by lasting longer and fitting better if you can get
the costbenefit ratio right siemens approach has excellent market potential


but that means the process chain has to be automated
from end to end what are the obstacles here 
professor denkena  the problems are usually at the interfaces  from product
design simulation and planning to the operation or programming of the
machine tools to the actual production siemens maps endtoend process
chains for its products and in my opinion thats a key prerequisite for success


one of your current research projects focuses on the
production and implantation of patientspecific prosthetics
 whats your vision 
professor denkena  our vision is to implement production processes directly on
site  that is we want to precisely manufacture components under sterile
conditions as close as possible to the operating room  when for example an
implant has to be replaced or a tumor removed you only see what the situa
tion really is when an operation is underway siemens is on the right track 
but our ultimate goal is to manufacture components very quickly right where
theyre needed


how long do you think it will be before that happens 
professor denkena  unfortunately these things always take longer than they
should thats been our experience anyway regulatory approval always plays
a big role in the healthcare field so i wouldnt be surprised if it took at least
ten years i hope it wont take that long but its difficult to make predictions
in any event im convinced that siemens has made a very important advance
since the process youve developed may provide many patients with better
prosthetics and thus enhance their quality of life

                                              mayor häupl what makes vienna so livable
                                              dr michael häupl  vienna is a mixture of grand classical traditions and high
                                              tech innovations the city stands for lifestyle and culture on the one hand
                                              and for business and science on the other the viennese are very hardwork
                                              ing but they also know how to enjoy life maybe thats what makes us a little
                                              different from other europeans we work to live we dont live to work


                                              according to a recent international study vienna is the
                                              smartest major city in the world
                                              dr michael häupl  when i took office nearly 20 years ago i saw it as my mission
                                             to turn vienna into a city of science knowledge research innovation and
                                             technology i consider our ranking as the smartest major city to be the fruit
                                             of our ongoing efforts to create intelligent solutions for our residents in various
72                                        76 areas  energy public transportation and road traffic management

in vienna 39 of all travel is via public transportation
well above the average of 28 for the rest of europes cities
whats your formula for success
dr michael häupl we listen carefully to the wishes of our citys residents and
they want public transportation that not only runs frequently and on schedule
but is also attractive and comfortable thats long been part of who we are in
vienna whats more we take the long view with our pricing policies we sold
an additional 100000 annual passes simply by lowering the daily price to 1


this report opens with a question more quality of life
or more economic growth is it possible to have both
dr michael häupl we see it happening here in vienna where 48 of austrias
tax revenue is generated a flourishing economy is the basis for our success
in the end you can only have a high quality of life if theres a very healthy
economic foundation


the siemens green city index gave vienna high marks
for sustainability but saw room for improvement in co2
emissions what is vienna doing to protect the climate
dr michael häupl our record isnt so bad vienna a major metropolis has              1          2
lower co2 emissions per capita than all the austrian states  but even thats
too high for us thats why weve defined emission limits for all new and reno
vated buildings and why were pushing alternative energy sources i have high
hopes for even smarter technologies that will enhance traffic management            1  dr michael häupl has been the

what contribution would you like to see siemens make to
the future of vienna
dr michael häupl siemens has had a profound influence on vienna ever since
the late 19th century and remains without a doubt the flagship of industry in our
city i hope we can continue our joint projects in the areas of transportation and
energy as well as partnerships with universities in the field of healthcare                                                  77
things are going well but from my perspective we could pick up the pace in
some areas

making infrastructures more intelligent
