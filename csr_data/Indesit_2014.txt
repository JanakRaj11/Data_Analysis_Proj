                 sustainability report 2013  to our stakeholders




to our stakeholders
                 2013 was another difficult year for the economy and the home appliance industry but for indesit it
                 was also characterized by positive elements such as the recovery of profitability in italy and solid
                 performance in the uk

                 the persistent contraction in demand in europe accompanied by the unexpected weakness of the
                 russian market and the strong appreciation of the euro against the other main continental european
                 currencies significantly affected the groups profitability

                 in this context we had to revise our plans yet again in order to defend the groups margins with
                 further measures to contain costs and selective adjustments to prices at the same time careful
                 financial management has enabled us to keep the indebtedness under control

                 another event that characterized the year for indesit company was the agreement reached with
                 government and the trade unions in december over the reorganization of the groups operations
                 in italy it provides for adequate use of social shock absorbers and extraordinary investments of euro
                 83 million to reorganize and upgrade our production capability in terms of both performance and
                 competitiveness

                 research work in the field of innovative home management technologies continued under the
                 homelab consortium which in january 2014 presented homelab open world a project aiming at
                 concrete sharing of information between products of various kinds from different home appliance
                 manufacturers and which will generate substantial benefits in terms of consumption levels usability
                 smart grid management diagnostics etc

                 the groups patents registered worldwide reached 1200 investments in research  development
                 amounted to euro 21 million we made a further improvement of over 4 in the quality of our
                 products we reduced energy consumption per unit manufactured by another 2 and consumption
                 of water by 15 and we continued to improve safety with 18 sites recording zero accidents and
                 reductions in our industrial sites of 39 in the frequency index and 40 in the seriousness index

                 in 2013 too we used the supplier selfassessment system in the fields of ethics the environment and
                 safety which involves not only compliance with organizational process and technical requisites and
                 workplace environmental and safety regulations but also the observance of ethical principles in line
                 with indesit companys social responsibility policies

                 2013 was also important for our social projects in support of communities in many countries where the
                 group operates and especially for the further consolidation in italy and poland of the jonathan project
                 which indesit has been supporting uninterruptedly for 15 years now the objective of this project
                 which uses innovative methods is to help young people with social and judicial problems reintegrate
                 into the community

                 2014 looks like yet another difficult year and we are well aware that we will have to deal with various
                 uncertainties we continue to look to the future with optimism however i am confident the measures
                 we took in 2013 are creating the conditions for furthering our plans to improve the groups margins
                 and growth

management         indesit company is also aware that its business and therefore its economic and financial performance
of environmental   performance are correlated to the risks and opportunities created by sustainability issues
impacts            firstly the need to reduce energy consumption is constantly stimulating the group to invest in
                   research and development for the production of increasingly ecofriendly household appliances and
                   the adoption of production systems respecting the ecosystem

                   secondly new legislation and the indesits own sensibility over environmental issues have led the
                   company to refine its environmental performance monitoring systems

                   in particular work continued on the implementation of the blink system to come into line with
                   the requirements of eu directive 201227 on energy efficiency installation of intelligent systems for
                   measuring energy consumption for the purposes of checking utilization profiles and monitoring
                   the data needed for analysis in preparation for the energy audits that will be obligatory from 2015
                   onwards the blink system is based on automatic metering in all factories linked to a central it
                   system to monitor environmental performance with respect to specific objectives used in incentive
                   programmes under which the environmental performance of certain company profiles is assessed

                   the data thus collected is also discussed in business reviews as is the state of progress on projects to
                   reduce consumption levels and environmental impacts




                                                                                                                                             9

economic background
                  the appliances market in 2013 lost around 15 in western europe and gained 08 in eastern europe
                  compared to 2012 these changes affected indesit groups economic and financial performance total
                  revenues were down by around 77 on 2012 mainly due to lower sales volumes and exchange rate
                  trends it should be noted that shrinking demand and the trend in exchange rates in the key markets
                  where the group operates made it necessary to cushion the negative impact on profitability by
                  adopting selective pricing policies which penalized sales volumes in the western europe area sales
                  of major domestic appliance mda finished products were down by around 106 on 2012 this
                  was mainly due to the reduction in sales volumes and the depreciation of the gb pound further the
                  contraction in home deliveries led to a drop in sales of the relative services in eastern europe sales
                  of mda finished products in 2013 were down 66 on 2012 due to the drastic effect of lower sales
                  volumes particularly significant on the russian market and depreciation of the ruble and turkish lira
                  in the noneuropean countries international area revenues from mda finished products were up 5
                  on 2012 these positive impacts were in part offset by the unfavourable trend in exchange rates

                       indesit company participates in a european research project  jade  promoted and coordinated by
                       regione marche to develop a technological district in support of active autonomy for the elderly as
                       life expectancy rises the population gets older and social costs rise making it necessary to safeguard
                       health and quality of life above all through active prevention of chronic illnesses this can be done
                       by developing webbased domotic technologies that enable the elderly to live in their own homes
                       in safety thanks to teleassistance and telemedicine which not only safeguard health but reduce the
                       need for hospitalization and relative costs
                       in particular jade is aiming to develop a common research agenda and a joint action plan with kent
                       county uk helsinki finland grenoble france and istanbul turkey to help define european policies
                       in support of promising technological applications for an intelligent environment with a primary
                       focus on the needs of the elderly in this context indesits focus is dual on one hand it will join a
                       network of the most innovative and competitive platforms in europe and on the other it will promote
                       a new role for networked home appliances that can interact with users and monitor their daily activities
                       to detect any anomalous behaviour indicative of anxiety or danger

     hicmo
     one of the first results of jade was hicmo hic manebimus optime  well be very well here a
     project launched in the 1st quarter of 2013 as a collaborative effort between regione marche indesit
     company other local companies and università politecnica delle marche its main objective is to
     design and develop a platform of products and services that will facilitate through the use of new
     technologies and telemedicine in particular a rational review of the distribution of social and health
     resources for the elderly a population characterized by chronicity fragility and disability hicmo aims
     to propose innovative models to help modernize the health system and its consolidated welfare
     practices not only in hospitals but also at home by pursuing the objective of improved efficiency and
     lower costs hicmo will operate in various scenarios in modern wired and intelligent homes it will
     be able to operate synergically by integrating the base cell the smart home at different levels of
     aggregation smart building smart city smart grid in the case of existing homes it will be able to
     create a domotics system to guarantee domestic appliance functioning the fridge as one of the smart
     objects in todays homes can act as a vitality sensor help the user if programmed interaction doesnt
     occur eg remote control of failure to take medicine and enable temperature monitoring of specific
     spaces for keeping medicines


     food
     the food project aims to preserve and increase the independence of people who still have a sufficient
     level of autonomy the solution is based on the integration of sensors and intelligent home appliances
     and webbased services and applications for information and communication in various social fields
     data supplied by sensors placed on people and in the environment and cooperation between artificial
     and human intelligence on the network will help to develop a service supporting the independence
     of people with difficulties peoples quality of life will also improve thanks to the intensification of
     interaction with the outside world afforded by the internet
     in 2012 indesits cooking business unit worked on the project to guarantee integration of the
     communication systems developed for the new luce electronic oven the system will transform the
     oven into a smart appliance capable together with other sensors of being more useful in the home
     with webbased services and applications giving access to communication and information in various
     social environments for ovens for example it will be possible to download recipes and cooking
     cycles share information with other users of the same system and get information on using the oven
     and controlling its consumption trials are run to gather information on use of the system and its
     performance to assess its actual efficacy
     2013 saw the completion of installation of sensors and monitoring and remote control systems in the
     netherlands romania and italy totalling 25 installations

                      comunanza site
                      a project to reduce and rationalize consumption of energy natural gas and water was implemented
                      this involved replacing the windows in the office block and installing insulation to improve the
                      buildings thermal isolation low consumption lamps were installed in work stations and along
                      the internal roads and a sectioning of the compressed air distribution network was made these
                      investments together with exhaustive monitoring and rationalization of consumption made it
                      possible to appreciably reduce consumption of energy per unit produced compared to 2012

                      fabriano and lipetsk sites
                      projects were implemented to improve waste management and waste sorting with special containers
                      and collection points in all areas info material on improving paper and cardboard management was
                      produced and distributed to employees and specific audits were run to raise awareness of such issues
                      in both production areas and offices these activities has led to a significant reduction in waste

                      ca maiano site
                      the ca maiano spare parts warehouse continued the green policy it adopted in 2012 with the
                      introduction of solutions such as car sharing and waste sorting and the use of recycled paper in
                      offices the main initiatives in 2013 included digital transmission of transport documents promotion
                      of warehouse waste sorting wooden pallets  plastic and polyethylene  paper and cardboard and
                      replacement of the boiler with a new natural gas boiler all these measures helped indesit save energy
                      and reduce its carbon footprint




                      the downward trend in consumption of energy and generation of waste in production facilities
                      continued in 2013 for the purpose of correct comparison with performance figures for prior years it
                      should be noted that the reporting boundary changed with respect to 2012 data for 2013 reflect the

                 ecodom collection in 2013

                 ecodom thanks to the collection of over 70000 tonnes of waste in italy thanks to the responsible disposal of it made it possible to


                 
                 produce the following quantities of secondary raw materials
                   over 43000 tonnes of iron


                  
                   about 2000 tonnes of copper
                   about 1700 tonnes of aluminium
                   about 7000 tonnes of plastic
                 use of raw materials from waste disposal delivered an electricity saving of over 73 million kwh compared to the energy needed to obtain
                 the same quantities of virgin materials and avoided around 760000 tonnes of co2 emissions for electricity the figure is equivalent to
                 the yearly needs of a town of about 60000 inhabitants while co2 avoided is equivalent to the absorption capacity for one year of a 400
                 km forest
