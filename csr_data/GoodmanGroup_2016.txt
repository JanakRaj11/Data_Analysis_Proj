shortterm incentive
financial targets
financial targets include operating eps return on assets net tangible assets per security and gearing across the
consolidated entity
however sti awards to executives are dependent on goodman achieving an operating eps target the board considers that
operating eps measures the direct contribution of executives to the financial performance of goodman strong performance
in operating eps generally correlates with stronger returns to securityholders and subject to market factors and conditions
security price increases
the operating profit target is set at the start of the financial year with reference to appropriate returns for goodmans business
segments having regard to the stage of the property cycle general economic conditions and growing the business in a
prudent manner
nonfinancial targets
nonfinancial targets include execution of strategic initiatives which position goodman for future sustainable growth
implementation of business process improvement initiatives and appropriate compliance and risk management controls
in addition to the above the performance of executives against behavioural expectations outlined within goodmans corporate
values has been considered in the determination of remuneration outcomes the board considers that executives should
demonstrate high standards of personal behaviour that are consistent with these values and therefore places emphasis upon
these characteristics
discretionary nature of award
the board recognises that expertise within goodman can lead to exceptional individual and divisional performance within a
specific financial year and accordingly retains discretion on the determination and payment of sti awards for executives even
where goodmans financial metrics may not have been met or other adverse circumstances occur conversely awards of sti
may be withheld notwithstanding that targets may have been met

longterm incentive
the ltip was last approved by securityholders in 2015 there have been no alterations or modifications to prior year awards
under the ltip
performance hurdles
the ltip incorporates both an operating eps and a relative tsr hurdle
the operating eps hurdle which applies to 75 of each award requires that the actual operating eps over a three year period
meets the cumulative target set by the board the target for each financial year is the same as that used for the purpose of the
sti and is set at the start of each financial year
in determining operating eps the share based payments expense is excluded from operating profit as the performance rights
are generally settled through the issue of new securities and those performance rights which as at the start of the financial
year have achieved the required performance hurdles but have not yet vested are included in the weighted average number of
securities reflecting the future dilution impact on securityholders for fy16 the 17812 million weighted average securities
used in calculating operating eps includes securities that have vested during the year plus 109 million securities which have
achieved the required performance hurdles and will vest in september 2016 and september 2017
the method for calculating the operating eps has been applied consistently throughout the period in which the ltip has been
in place and the methodology is used for setting the target and financial performance forecast at the commencement of each
financial year
the relative tsr hurdle which applies to 25 of each award is based on the relative tsr of goodman against that of other
spasx 100 entities over a three year period
vesting
the operating eps performance hurdle will be satisfied in full when the cumulative operating eps over three consecutive
financial years meets or exceeds the target set by the board if the cumulative target is not met then there is nil vesting against
this hurdle the board believes that it would currently be inconsistent with securityholders expectations for there to be partial
satisfaction of the hurdle where the target operating eps had not been met
the relative tsr performance hurdle operates over a range of outcomes such that where goodmans performance is
 from the 1st to 50th percentile there is no vesting
 from the 51st percentile ie aboveaverage performance there is 50 vesting with an additional 2 vesting for each
  additional percentile rank to the 76th percentile and
 from the 76th percentile and above there is 100 vesting
partial vesting against this hurdle only commences once aboveaverage returns are achieved the board considers the
spasx 100 index is the most appropriate comparator group given that
 goodman is ranked by market capitalisation within the top 100 asx listed entities
 goodman competes for investment capital against the top 100 asx listed entities and
 the comparator group is sufficiently broad to include a sample of businesses with geographic diversity and business
   complexity
vesting of all performance rights is contingent on executives remaining employed by goodman at the relevant vesting dates
at the end of years three four and five as a result in order to derive the full benefits of an award an executive must remain
employed over a five year vesting period
hedging of unvested performance rights
the boards policy set out in the securities trading policy is that executives may not enter into any arrangement to limit their
exposure to risk in relation to unvested performance rights options or securities issued under an employee incentive plan
in accordance with their terms of employment executives are required to comply with goodmans policies

 financial years this includes the base pay and cash bonus sti that relate to each financial year plus the value of the
 performance rights lti that vested during the financial year this value of performance rights is determined by multiplying the
 number of securities that vested by the market price of the securities at the date of vesting this is different from the statutory

 over the five year period the level of sti has generally been at the upper end of the bonus range in line with the operational
 achievements however in fy16 the group chief executive officer has not received any sti but instead will receive all his
 incentive based remuneration in the form of at risk lti with the relevant award of performance rights to be made in fy17
 in respect of the vested lti 52 million 2015 46 million of performance rights vested during fy16 based on the midmarket
 price of a goodman security of 596 at the vesting date on 1 september 2015 the increase in the cash value of the lti is due
 to both an increase in the number of performance rights awarded and the increase in the goodman security price reflecting the
 consistently strong performance over the past five years
 shortterm incentive awards to executives
 sti awards are made to executives based on their performance and contribution to the business during the financial year
 including the achievement of agreed performance targets and strategic initiatives that relate to both financial and non
 financial criteria for their business units other parts of the business and goodman as a whole specialisation exists within the
 management structure however overall success is heavily dependent upon the input from other regions and the group function
 goodmans integrated business model means that achievements are often a product of collective effort
 for fy16 the committee considered that the performance of the executives in relation to various strategic initiatives
 represented an overall performance that achieved the agreed performance targets and sti awards for the executives are
 towards the upper end of the cash bonus range

subject to meeting the employment conditions and will be delivered to executives in three tranches on an annual basis

grants the operating eps hurdles have been met or exceeded to date and relative tsr hurdles are on track to be partially

notes in relation to the table analysis of performance rights over goodman securities
1 the fair value is determined at grant date and calculated using a combination of the standard black scholes model with a
   continuous dividenddistribution yield and a monte carlo model which simulated total returns for each of the spasx 100
   entities and discounted the future value of any potential future vesting performance rights to arrive at a present value
2 as performance rights have an exercise price of nil goodman securities are automatically issued to employees when the
   performance rights vest accordingly the percentage of performance rights that vested during the financial year equals the
   percentage of securities issued during the financial year
3 the value of performance rights vested is calculated using the closing price on the asx of 596 on 1 september 2015 the day
   the performance rights vested
4 as goodman securities are automatically issued to employees when the performance rights vest the expiry date is deemed to
   be the vesting date

basic profit per security is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the securityholders by the weighted average
number of securities outstanding during the year diluted profit per security is determined by adjusting the profit or loss
attributable to the securityholders and weighted average number of securities outstanding for all dilutive potential securities
which comprise performance rights issued under the ltip and securities contingently issuable on conversion of hybrid securities
under australian accounting standards the issued units of git and the cdis over the shares of glhk are presented as non

5 income tax
income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity
in which case it is recognised in equity
current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the financial year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect
of previous financial years
deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes the following temporary differences are not accounted for
 goodwill
 the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and
 differences relating to investments in controlled entities to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future
the amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of
assets and liabilities deferred tax assets or liabilities in respect of investment properties held at fair value are calculated on
the presumption that the carrying amount of the investment property will be recovered through sale a deferred tax asset is
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised
deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised
additional income taxes that arise from dividendsdistributions are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related
dividendsdistributions
git
under current australian income tax legislation git is not liable for income tax including capital gains tax provided that
securityholders are presently entitled to the distributable income of git as calculated for trust law purposes tax allowances
for building and plant and equipment depreciation are distributed to securityholders in the form of tax deferred components
of distributions any taxable capital gains are distributed

 values of the developments in the feasibility studies are based
 on assumptions to determine capitalisation rates letting up
 periods and incentives that are consistent with those observed
 in the relevant market adjusted for a profit and risk factor this
 profit and risk factor will vary depending on the nature location
 and size of the development but is generally in a market range
 of 10 to 15
 this practice of determining fair value by reference to the
 development feasibility is generally also applied for goodmans
 investments in managed partnerships however certain
 partnerships do obtain independent valuations for investment
 properties under development each financial year

other information regarding directly held investment properties
the fair value measurement approach for directly held investment properties has been categorised as a level 3 fair value
based on the inputs to the valuation method used see notes 1g and 6c the majority of goodmans directly held investment
properties are in australia and the valuation technique used in measuring the fair value as well as the values assumed for the
significant unobservable inputs are summarised in the table below
valuation technique                significant unobservable input                                                 2016              2015
income capitalisation              range of net market rents per square metre per annum                  40 to 300       42 to 300

the estimated fair value would increase if net market rents were higher andor if capitalisation rates were lower the estimated fair
value would decrease if the net market rents were lower andor if the capitalisation rates were higher

f investments accounted for using the equity method
investments accounted for using the equity method comprise associates and jvs which are collectively referred to as managed
partnerships
associates
an associate is an entity in which the consolidated entity exercises significant influence but not control over its financial and
operating policies in the consolidated financial statements investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method
investments in associates are carried at the lower of the equity accounted amount and recoverable amount under this method
the consolidated entitys share of postacquisition gains or losses of associates is recognised in the consolidated income
statement and its share of postacquisition movements in reserves is recognised in consolidated reserves cumulative post
acquisition movements in both profit or loss and reserves are adjusted against the cost of the investment
jvs
a jv is an arrangement in which the consolidated entity has joint control whereby the consolidated entity has rights to the net
assets of the arrangement rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities in the consolidated financial statements
investments in jvs are accounted for using the equity method investments in jvs are carried at the lower of the equity accounted
amount and recoverable amount the consolidated entitys share of the jvs net profit or loss is recognised in the consolidated
income statement from the date joint control commences to the date joint control ceases movements in reserves are recognised
directly in the consolidated reserves
transactions eliminated on consolidation
unrealised gains resulting from transactions with associates and jvs including those relating to contributions of nonmonetary
assets on establishment are eliminated to the extent of the consolidated entitys interest unrealised gains relating to associates
and jvs are eliminated against the carrying amount of the investment unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as
unrealised gains unless they evidence an impairment of an asset

 for united kingdom  logistics the forecasts assume that over the next five years the division will increase its aum from
 100 million to approximately 815 million as gukp draws down committed equity from its investors to fund the expected
 development activity for the purpose of the forecasts capitalisation rates are expected to be stable over the period

 c credit risk
 credit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties failed to perform as contracted
 the maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets excluding investments of the consolidated entity which have been
 recognised on the statement of financial position is the carrying amount
 the consolidated entity has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of all potential customers and is not materially exposed
 to any one customer the consolidated entity evaluates all customers perceived credit risk and may require the lodgement of
 rental bonds or bank guarantees as appropriate to reduce credit risk in addition all rents are payable monthly in advance
 the consolidated entity minimises credit risk by dealing with major financial institutions in relation to cash and shortterm
 borrowings concentration of credit risk exists from time to time on receivables for the proceeds of disposals of investment
 properties the credit risk is minimised as legal title is only transferred upon receipt of proceeds for the sale of those assets and
 typically goodman will have either received a cash deposit or be the beneficiary of a bank guarantee for 10 to 20 of the total
 proceeds
 from time to time the consolidated entity also makes loans to managed partnerships typically to fund development projects
 in making its investment decisions the consolidated entity will undertake a detailed assessment of the development feasibility
 and credit risks associated with the relevant counterparties
 the credit risks associated with financial instruments are managed by
  transacting with multiple derivatives counterparties that have a longterm investment credit rating and
  utilising international swaps and derivatives association isda agreements with derivative counterparties in order to limit
   exposure to credit risk through netting of amounts receivable and amounts payable to individual counterparties refer below
 master netting or similar agreements
 the consolidated entity enters into derivative transactions under isda master netting off agreements under these agreements
 where certain credit events occur such as a default all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated and a single
 net termination value is payable in full and final settlement
 as the consolidated entity does not have any current legally enforceable right to offset the fair values associated with derivative
 financial instruments have been presented gross in the statement of financial position however if a credit event occurred the
 isda master netting off agreement would allow a1241 million 2015 a1445 million of financial assets and financial liabilities
 in relation to the consolidated entitys derivative financial instruments to be offset

b share based payments
share based payment transactions
the fair value of performance rights over securities at the grant date is expensed with a corresponding increase in the employee
compensation reserve the share based payments expense is calculated over the period to the vesting date and is adjusted to
reflect the actual number of performance rights for which the related service and nonmarket vesting conditions are expected
to be met the accumulated share based payments expense of performance rights which have vested or lapsed is transferred
from the employee compensation reserve to accumulated lossesretained earnings the fair values of performance rights are
measured at grant date using a combination of black scholes pricing models and monte carlo simulations
at 30 june 2016 the consolidated entity had two share based payment schemes the ltip and the gtep in addition a specific
longterm incentive plan exists for goodmans employees in new zealand details of these schemes are set out below

or in certain jurisdictions to receive an amount in cash equal to the value of the securities subject to the vesting conditions

the fair value of services received in return for performance rights granted under the ltip is measured by reference to the fair
value of the performance rights granted the estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured as follows
 operating eps tranche these rights have been valued as a granted call option using the standard black scholes model with
  a continuous dividenddistribution yield and
 relative tsr tranche these rights have been valued using a monte carlo model which simulated total returns for each of the
  asx 100 stocks and discounted the future value of any potential future vesting performance rights to arrive at a present value
  the model uses statistical analysis to forecast total returns based on expected parameters of variance and covariance
at 30 june 2016 a liability of 160 million 2015 116 million was recognised in relation to cash settled performance rights
gtep
under the gtep a number of australian based employees are also offered up to 1000 annually of restricted securities
the intention of the gtep is to broaden employee alignment with securityholders under tax legislation employees with
adjusted taxable income of less than 180000 per annum are not subject to income tax when these restricted securities
are granted this tax exemption requires that there be no forfeiture conditions and that participating employees be restricted
from dealing with the securities for three years
goodmans new zealand long term incentive plan
under goodmans new zealand long term incentive plan employees receive approximately half of their lti in the form of
performance rights over gmt units that vest subject to meeting performance hurdles based on the achievement of distributable
earnings targets by gmt and the relative total unitholder return from holding gmt units compared to other nzx property vehicles
on vesting delivery of units in gmt will be made from units held by the consolidated entity or acquired on market

other information regarding directly held investment properties
the fair value measurement approach for directly held investment properties has been categorised as a level 3 fair value based
on the inputs to the valuation technique used see notes 1h and 5c the majority of the consolidated entitys directly held
investment properties are in australia and the valuation technique used in measuring the fair value as well as the values assumed
for the significant unobservable inputs are summarised in the table below
valuation technique                significant unobservable input                                                 2016              2015
income capitalisation              range of net market rents per square metre per annum                  40 to 300       42 to 300

the estimated fair value would increase if net market rents were higher andor if capitalisation rates were lower the estimated fair
value would decrease if the net market rents were lower andor if the capitalisation rates were higher

consolidated entity as partnerships

operating policies in the consolidated financial statements investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method
investments in associates are carried at the lower of the equity accounted amount and recoverable amount under this method
the consolidated entitys share of postacquisition gains or losses of associates is recognised in the consolidated income
statement and its share of postacquisition movements in reserves is recognised in consolidated reserves cumulative post
acquisition movements in both profit or loss and reserves are adjusted against the cost of the investment
jvs
a jv is an arrangement in which the consolidated entity has joint control whereby the consolidated entity has rights to the net
assets of the arrangement rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities in the consolidated financial statements
investments in jvs are accounted for using the equity method investments in jvs are carried at the lower of the equity accounted
amount and recoverable amount the consolidated entitys share of the jvs net profit or loss is recognised in the consolidated
income statement from the date joint control commences to the date joint control ceases movements in reserves are recognised
directly in the consolidated reserves
transactions eliminated on consolidation
unrealised gains resulting from transactions with associates and jvs including those relating to contributions of nonmonetary
assets on establishment are eliminated to the extent of the consolidated entitys interest unrealised gains relating to associates
and jvs are eliminated against the carrying amount of the investment unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as
unrealised gains unless they evidence an impairment of an asset

6 receivables
receivables comprise loans to related parties and trade and other receivables and are recognised on the date that they are
originated initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition receivables are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any impairment losses
the consolidated entity derecognises a receivable when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the receivable expire or it
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the receivable in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and
rewards of the receivable are transferred
impairment
the carrying amounts of receivables is assessed at each balance date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment
if such indication exists the receivable is written down to the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the
original effective interest rate the impairment is recognised in profit or loss in the reporting period in which it occurs
calculation of recoverable amount
the recoverable amount of the consolidated entitys receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of
estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate ie the effective interest rate computed at initial
recognition of these financial assets receivables with a short duration are not discounted
impairment of receivables is not recognised until objective evidence is available that a loss event has occurred significant

sensitivity analysis
throughout the financial year if the australian dollar had been 5 2015 5 stronger against all other currencies with all
other variables held constant the profit attributable to unitholders excluding derivative mark to market and unrealised foreign
exchange movements would have decreased by a186 million 2015 a45 million decrease if the australian dollar had been
5 2015 5 weaker against all other currencies with all other variables held constant the profit attributable to unitholders
excluding derivative mark to market and unrealised foreign exchange movements would have increased by a186 million
2015 a45 million increase
interest rate risk
the consolidated entitys interest rate risk arises from variable rate borrowings and also fixed rate to floating rate ccirs that
hedge the currency risk associated with the usd denominated notes and jpy denominated private placement the consolidated
entity adopts a policy of ensuring that between 60 and 100 of its current year exposure to changes in interest rates on
borrowings is on a fixed rate basis the consolidated entity enters into interest rate swaps irs to manage cash flow risks
associated with the interest rates on borrowings that are floating the irs contracts are for 90 day intervals and involve quarterly
payments or receipts of the net amount of interest

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
hkfrss requires management to make judgements estimates
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and
reported amounts of assets liabilities income and expenses
the estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which
form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources actual results may differ from these estimates
the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on
an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the
revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision
and future periods if the revision affects both current and
future periods

4 income tax expense
income tax for the period comprises current tax and movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities current tax and movements
in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to items recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity in which case the relevant amounts of tax are recognised in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity respectively
current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at
the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from deductible and taxable temporary differences respectively being the differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases deferred tax assets also
arise from unused tax losses and unused tax credits apart from differences which arise on initial recognition of assets and liabilities
all deferred tax liabilities and all deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised are recognised
the amount of deferred tax recognised is measured based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying
amount of the assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date deferred tax assets
and liabilities are not discounted

 at the grant date is recognised as a share based payment expense in the results of the consolidated entity with a corresponding
 increase in equity the share based payment expense is calculated over the period to the vesting date and is adjusted to reflect
 the actual number of rights or options for which the related service and nonmarket vesting conditions are expected to be met

 scholes pricing models

 the ltip which provides for the issue of performance rights was first approved at the 2009 annual general meeting of goodman
 group and subsequently at the 2012 annual general meeting each performance right issued under the ltip entitles an employee
 to acquire a goodman group stapled security for nil consideration subject to the vesting conditions having been satisfied the
 ltip also provides for the issue of options though this has not been utilised to date if options were to be issued each option
 would entitle an employee to acquire a goodman group stapled security on payment of the exercise price for the option subject
 to the vesting conditions having been satisfied
 under the terms of the ltip and decisions made by the directors of goodman group in accordance with the plan the issues of
 performance rights on 23 september 2015 and 25 november 2015 to employees and directors respectively were subject to the
 following broad terms

   return tsr in excess of that achieved by 50 of listed entities in the spasx 100 index and the exercise of 75 of the total
   performance rights will be conditional on goodman group achieving an operating earnings per share eps outcome at least at
   the target level notified to the market over a three year testing period which ends on 30 june 2018 and continued employment

   exceeds the 51st percentile in tsr there are proportionate increases in vesting of performance rights up to 100 at the 76th
   percentile under the grants made pursuant to the rules and disclosed to the market

1 in prior periods unrealised gains or losses on investment properties were transferred from retained earnings to the asset revaluation reserve from 1 july
   2015 the consolidated entity has amended its practice such that these unrealised gains or losses are maintained in retained earnings and any relevant
   amounts included in the asset revaluation reserve at 1 july 2015 have been transferred back to retained earnings

   amount in the common control reserve reflects the difference between the consideration paid and the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the
   acquired entity at the date of acquisition
