         letter from the ceo
         dear stakeholders



         in 2014 we worked hard to build the platform for a new phase in the development of

         our business

         month by month autogrill consolidated its strength in mature markets like europe and

         north america and took important growth opportunities in emerging markets mainly

         by winning new contracts in major airports in fast growing economies like vietnam

         indonesia the united arab emirates and turkey

         these initiatives reflect our groups main focus on the airport channel where we have

         made heavy investments and developed new foodservice concepts that we hope will

         satisfy the needs  which are continually evolving and increasingly sophisticated 

         of all the travellers that visit our points of sale every day

         meanwhile in italy where the market continued to be weak autogrill started to redefine

         its boundary of operations to concentrate resources on the locations with the highest

         potential

         thanks to these measures and the numerous innovations weve introduced as well as

         the knowhow acquired by the group over many years of doing business globally i am

         confident that autogrill can exploit the new opportunities that will arise in the future

         a future we are confident of also in light of falling oil prices which favour increases in

         traffic flows

         with these assumptions we will continue the work done last year with the conviction that

         we can build on the good results delivered in 2014

1 identification of issues

the starting point was the identification of the potentially material aspects eg csr
issues analyzing the sources that could provide a complete analysis of the company
from the outside and multistakeholder discussion and exchange platforms at the
international level


institutional requests and guidelines
 european directive on disclosure of nonfinancial and diversity information
 european modern restaurant association report
 requests from ethical investment funds


sustainability framework
 global reporting initiative guidelines
 uni iso 26000 guidelines
 un global compact
 sustainability accounting standards board


peers

considered examples for autogrill in terms of good sustainability practices




                                                                      2014 sustainability report

                       the issues identified as potentially material for autogrill and upon which all subsequent
                       analyses were performed are

2 general internal analysis by csr

after the identification of the relevant issues classified based on the relevant attribution
to the people product planet and governance areas and in some cases also grouped




                                                                                                       materiality analysis
together under a common umbrella the analysis started giving a score to the various
issues taking into account the group peculiarities
 business segment
 context
 vision mission strategy
 risk analysis


and the criteria that in our opinion define the concept of creating or retaining value 
 impact on sales
 competitiveness  new opportunities
 social license to operate
 consumer perception
 employee engagement
 attraction of talents
 compliance
 reputation


in addition to assigning a score to the different issues the second part of the analysis
focused on determining a rating with reference to
 the perimeter of the issue the boundary within which the impact can become
    visible geographic businessrelated supply chainbased
 the degree of control that the organization has on the management potential or
    actual of that specific issue ie the control of the issue and its ability to influence it
the implemented logic envisages that materiality is increased for any specific issue
when the corresponding perimeter focuses more on the inside of the organization and
at the same time the greater the control real or potential the more the same issue is
considered material
all considerations made in this first phase of the analysis are based as indicated
above on autogrill peculiarities see chapter acompany and strategy and
sustainability



3 specialist internal analysis by the management

after completion of the first general analysis of the issues by csr which for self
explanatory reasons is particularly oriented towards sustainability based on the long
run and aimed at assessing risks  opportunities emerging from the same issues the
other divisions of the organization were also invited to contribute in order to construct a
general view and identify possible corrections for the process and score attributed to
the various issues and also to carry out a specialized vertical analysis on their activities
and responsibilities as experts on the different issues




                                                                          2014 sustainability report

                                 12




                                 4 analysis of external perspective

                                 the issues were also analyzed based on the principle of stakeholder inclusiveness in
                                 order to develop a complete framework reflecting how stakeholders prioritize specific
materiality analysis




                                 issues the following topics were taken into account
                                  international business reports
                                  international general opinion reports
                                  autogrill press kit analysis
                                  consumer requests resulting from the customer satisfaction survey
                                  worker requests resulting from the employee engagement survey
                                  interviews with managers who are in direct contact with the stakeholders to
                                      analyze their perception about the issues based on the groups knowledge of its
                                      stakeholders



                                 5 development of the materiality chart

                                 after completing these analyses and sharing the corresponding outcomes all scores
                                 were summed up for each issue in order to measure the importance of the same issue to
                                 the organization internal analysis and the importance that stakeholders attribute to it
                                 the issues taken into account were then consolidated and mapped on a graph
                                 showing stakeholder expectations on the vertical axis and the importance that the
                                 organization attributes to the items analyzed with a view to business success on the
                                 horizontal axis




                                 comments to the chart
                       g419
                                 the chart reflects the importance of the sustainability issues to autogrill in this specific
                                 period the pressures and trends change over time and for this reason the graph should
                                 not be considered either static or final and should instead be periodically updated
                                 compliance with the law is considered by definition a key and substantial issue for the
                                 entire population of the organization this is why it was not directly reflected in the
                                 materiality analysis but is accounted for as a criterion for the definition of the
                                 importance of the various issues in the same way stakeholder engagement is
                                 considered an element at the basis of the concept of sustainability and is key for the
                                 materiality analysis for this reason it is included as a criterion for the development of
                                 the graph and is not visible in it
                                 as indicated in the graph the key material issues for autogrill refer to its core business
                                 and its offering and those connected with people  in particular its workers  as
                                 autogrill is a service company that currently employs more than 54000 employees

30 years while airport concessions range from 5 to 10 years on average

the autogrill group is exposed to external risks and uncertainties deriving from factors
correlated with the general macroeconomic context or the specific industry in which
the group operates the financial markets the evolution of the regulatory framework
and the risks deriving from the strategic decisions and linked to the management of
operational processes
the objective of the groups risk management function is to ensure that the different
business units making up the group manage risks in a standardized way through the
implementation of a model based on the systematic identification analysis and
assessment of the risk areas that can have an impact on the attainment of the groups
strategic objectives contributing to the assessment of the companys exposure to risks
and the development of the necessary risk mitigation actions aiming at reducing the
level of volatility of the groups preestablished objectives
here below is an analysis of the main risk areas broken down by businessrelated
risks and financial risks for additional details on this specific topic reference should
be made to the 2014 annual report




businessrelated risks

external factors traffic flow and propensity to spend
the group activities depend on traffic flow any factor that may significantly reduce
traffic flow in the countries and channels in which the group operates represents a risk
for the generation of value
among the external factors and as such uncontrollable which can have an impact on
traffic flow and traveler propensity to spend are the general economic scenario and
its trend  in particular consumer confidence inflation unemployment levels and
interest rates  increases in the crude oil price and increases in transportation costs in
general
traffic and average spending can also be affected by other uncontrollable events
including for instance alternative travel options changes in applicable laws and
regulations governing or influencing the performance of the group activities in the
specific operation channel particularly relevant for airports airline strategies and
policies strikes political uncertainty terrorist attacks or threats natural catastrophes
pandemics conflicts and wars




                                                                      2014 sustainability report

                                    reputation
                                    reputation both in relation to customers the landlords and licensors representing the
                                    main stakeholders from this perspective is particularly important for the group and
                                    represents one of the main assessment factors in the process of assignment and
the world of autogrill




                                    renewal of the concessions by landlords
                                    events leading to a reduction or loss of reputation are in particular attributable to the
                                    reduction in the quality perceived of the service rendered  in the first case  resulting in
                                    reduced attractiveness and loss of customers and in the second case to the inability
                                    to fulfill contractual obligations with landlords and licensors jeopardizing the possible
                                    renewal and continuity of the relationship


                                    consumption habits
                                    changes in consumption habits represent a risk if the group does not promptly and
                                    adequately react to changing customer requests with actions targeting the service
                                    model and the offering


                                    inexpensiveness of concession contracts
                                    group operations are mainly ensured through multiyear contracts for the assignment of
                                    commercial services awarded through competitive tenders by the landlords of
                                    concessions for the management of the infrastructures airports highways railway
                                    stations etc concessions are a key asset for the group and their renewal at
                                    competitive conditions or the assignment of new concessions represents a strategic
                                    factor in addition the concession contracts stipulated by the group generally
                                    envisage besides a multiyear duration the obligation for the company to pay an
                                    annual minimum concession fee regardless of the revenues generated as a result of
                                    the contract enforced in the case in which the revenues generated by the concession
                                    are lower than the value budgeted upon its assignment also as a result of reduced
                                    traffic or reduced spending its profitability may be reduced or even become negative
                                    as a consequence of the obligation to pay the minimum fee




                         risk management                    the objective is to manage risks
                                                            in a standardized way

materiality

maximize the value of this vision

and its stakeholders


the chapter includes also some other topics relevant to autogrill even if not strictly
material which the group thought it opportune to include in sustainability report

mystery client is an employee who being responsible for assessing quality visits the
stores incognito pretending to be a normal customer


in italy the areas monitored by mystery clients were in line with those surveyed
through customer satisfaction see page 78 these are therefore more focused on
customer experience following the customeroriented approach that characterizes
autogrills new way of doing business after the visits carried out by an
independent company an assessment form is filled out on the store visited


the results are then promptly communicated to the main offices and store managers for
the purpose of designing improvement actions the mystery clients findings matched
with those of the customer satisfaction surveys are also entered in the mbo system of

              barrier effect with food is guaranteed by the application of a layer of opp oriented
              polypropylene film the reduced weight of the packaging also resulted in a
              reduced impact due to both savings in the use of raw materials and in the
              management of its disposal in addition the use of the material deriving from post

operating under concession agreements in complex and differentiated situations like
the travel channel means first and foremost knowing how to adjust the procedures
developed for environmental protection to the requirements of the different types of
landlords it also means identifying common points of integration around shared
principles like for instance the responsible use of water and energy reducing polluting
emissions using ecosustainable packaging and applying appropriate waste disposal
procedures
the most important factor is engagement getting both collaborators and consumers to
pull in the same direction in fact protecting the environment means first and foremost
consuming less and therefore it is of key importance to raise employee awareness
and foster employee engagement and commitment so that everybody makes a
contribution to sustainability



                            the commitment towards environmental compliance
                            and protection poses great challenges and difficulties


only a cultural transformation can lead people to reduce their energy and water
consumption this requires changing ingrained habits and a reorientation of workers
who use the equipment on a daily basis suppliers who produce it and consumers who
come to autogrill stores and make use of the services in order to disseminate a pro
environment culture autogrill designs ongoing projects targeted to all group employees
to raise their awareness and engagement in terms of environmental protection and
waste reduction the message conveyed to collaborators focuses on the proper use of
kitchen equipment hot plates ovens deepfryers dishwashers etc which in low
traffic time slots may be switched off thus generating significant savings other
initiatives are targeted to consumers like the sale of compostable shoppers or jute
bags themefocused communication campaigns focusing on sustainability issues and
the proposal of waste differentiation
the group aconnect portal includes the afuture section this is a virtual location
containing all the information of the roadmap ranging from its history to the news and
events from all over the world dedicated to the dissemination of the principles of
sustainability last but not least the monthly column go green was developed to
disseminate best practices for the responsible use of paper water and power simple
concrete actions that every worker can apply every day

delivered on site with packaging that must be disposed of the correct approach to
each of these steps represents another fundamental engagement in favor of the
environment operating in airports railway stations and malls also implies compliance
with the waste management policies adopted by the landlord on the highways 
where autogrill though operating under concession is responsible for waste  the
group relies on the municipal services and where these are not available it
establishes collaborations with specialized companies this is the starting point for the
analysis of the various aspects that pertain to differentiated waste collection recovery
and recycling in all the stores where the local conditions allow it autogrill group has
introduced waste differentiation
the group is committed to reducing waste particularly in relation to the
undifferentiated portion by installing waste collection and recycling systems in the
back of its stores on one hand and reducing the volume of waste in order to
decrease the number of waste pickups and the relevant environmental and economic
impact linked to logistics through the installation of compactors and glasscrushing
machines on the other



                                      the group is committed to reducing waste
                                      by installing waste collection and recycling
                                      systems


at the european level austria belgium france italy spain and switzerland a
growing number of stores are committed to differentiating oil plastic and paper and
where possible also recycling plastic materials and glass bottles collected from
consumers
autogrill italia collaborates with the main specialized waste management operators for
the management of the service that collects waste from the stores located on the
highways which are not always covered by local municipal services the agreement
includes the collection of waste in a deferred way meaning that waste is first collected
from the store undifferentiated except for paper and paperboard and then brought to
a selectiontreatment plant where it is separated in particular cooking oil is separated
and collected separately in all stores making use of it and is used to make fuel
moreover in approximately 30 stores on the highway where waste collection is
entrusted by the group to private operators organic waste is collected separately and

                         to this end in 2013 a project was launched in collaboration with wwf italia which
                         envisaged the development of an experimental hub dedicated to food waste the
                         project involved the highway service stations of villoresi est brianza nord and brianza
                         sud located close to the city of milan the project which is part of the wwf one
                         planet food program envisages the development of an integrated supply chain which

                         again in italy the destinazione ambiente project was continued currently involving
                         13 stores along the turinvenice a4 highway the initiative was launched in 2009
                         thanks to a collaboration with conai consorzio nazionale imballaggi italian

                         both the preparation and distribution of food for the purpose of the project not only
                         workers are asked to contribute but also consumers inside and outside the stores
                         to this end different forms of communication and different ad hoc designed devices
                         will be installed to collect different waste types


                         in the stores located at the seattletacoma international airport in the united states
                         thanks to a direct partnership with the airport facility management company hmshost
                         developed a method to reduce the quantity of organic waste and paper brought to the
                         landfill using composting in the back of the store and replacing disposables with
                         recyclable materials in the 5 restaurants managed

all employees were informed on waste management procedures and in addition to
preventing compostable and recyclable waste from being brought to the landfill
including organic waste and paper the store succeeded in registering a monthly
saving on the cost of waste collection and strengthened its collaboration with the
landlord by contributing to the same landlords objective of ecosustainability recycling




                                                                                                     aplanet

containers in atlanta


in 2010 the locations in france began involving customers proactively through the
development  in partnership with the cocacola company  of equipment to
differentiate and collect pet bottles and cans in the store of carrousel du louvre
this equipment was then installed over the years in another 20 locations
moreover the plastic material used for takeaway packaging was eliminated


the decision to use bags produced from recycled or biodegradable material was
made unanimously by autogrill france autogrill austria hmshost and autogrill italia




excess food
the management systems developed and finetuned over the years thanks to
experience and technology enable autogrill group to calculate customer flows to each
store every day of the year with a relatively low error margin these systems allow the
group to


 meet consumer demand minimizing the risk of unavailability of a minimum basic
    offer on one hand and
 reduce scrap and food in excess by more precisely calculating the quantities and
    foods to cook on the other


methods and procedures represent the first step towards reducing scraps including
excess food the rigor that has always characterized autogrill in this field enables
it to produce fewer scraps in the united states hmshost collaborates with food
donation connection developing programs for the donation of food products from
the stores located at airports and on highways


thanks to this project in the united states autogrill manages to collect excess food
and redistribute it to the community in italy autogrill continues its collaboration with
banco alimentare to which it donates excess food

                         at the end of 2011 autogrill launched for the first time an internal challenge in terms of
                         sustainability objectives to be reached within 2015 based on 2012 data
                         in the planet area one of autogrills objectives is energy consumption
                         during the course of 2014 the energy consumption index improved by 5 mwh
                         against 2013
                         as to new stores opened in 2014 the energy consumption index improved by 4
                         mwh against 2013

                         note the perimeter of reference was identified based on the robustness of the currently implemented
                         analysis system which enables an effective flow of data useful for monitoring the objectives included in
                         the roadmap italy belgium france spain and austria




                                                                         2014 sustainability report

           inside the los angeles international airport hmshost implemented energy star certified
           equipment refrigerators grill hot plates etc the innovation of the energy
           management system inside the new international terminal f in atlanta was also of
           interest this refers to an innovative ventilation system used in kitchens through this
           integrated system the fans automatically change based on the temperature in the
aplanet




           discharge flues saving energy this new system distinguishes between the moments in
           which food is being prepared the troughs and peaks with reduced traffic fan speed
           slows down and the air ventilation switches off thus reducing operating costs


           in spain autogrill relaunched the edison project in 2014 the objective of the
           project is the efficient reduction of energy consumption in the stores maintaining
           worker awareness towards environmental issues high an important characteristic
           of this project is operator awareness considered the key to a successful energy
           efficiency policy


           the project envisages training courses for store managers a practical manual for the
           correct use of equipment and information about energy consumption a calendar was
           also developed for each store to help use air conditioning and heating efficiently
           moreover a competition was launched among the stores with the objective of
           increasing employee engagement in the initiative aimed at reducing energy
           consumption
           in the netherlands concerted efforts were made to bring about improvements
           especially with regard to energy efficiency these efforts resulted in the achievement of
           good results in recent years smart energy meters were installed in all stores as well as
           gas meters
           sharing best practices among the countries within the group plays a fundamental role
           in terms of engineering aspects and technical purchases similarly to the management
           of other business aspects human resources product offering and new service
           development


           for instance the use of led technology in new stores is spreading in all the
           countries in which the group operates like the use of the highspeed panini grills
           hot plate developed in collaboration with electrolux this solution combines three
           different technologies in a single piece of equipment contact plate infrared and
           microwave 30 seconds are sufficient to warm up a sandwich instead of the 2
           minutes required using traditional plates and they consume 05 kwh half as much
           as the traditional ones this technology also contributed to improving employee
           safety in the workplace



           in addition after an initial test which proved very successful with consumers open
           refrigerators were replaced with refrigerators equipped with sliding doors in the stores
           in europe this small modification will also yield energy savings
           recovery of gases potentially hazardous to the ozone layer from the refrigerating plants
           is performed in accordance with international standards and under safe conditions for
           human health and the environment in all the stores located in italy all plants containing
           gases potentially hazardous to the ozone layer are registered and managed according
           to specific maintenance standards by companies responsible for store maintenance

any maintenance activity is registered in specific logbooks with an indication of the
plant specifications and activities performed based on the results of the relevant

in relation to the role played by autogrill in facilitating sustainable mobility at the
delaware welcome center hmshost has developed a project dedicated to truck
drivers designed in collaboration with cabaire a company supplying electronic
components for trucks in the parking area of the infrastructure there are now 50
stations supplying electricity for trucks to power air conditioning and heating without
keeping the motor running the delaware welcome center also features stations for
recharging electric vehicles
in italy in 2014 the first twelve supercharger tesla systems were installed in the gas
station of dorno est and dorno ovest on the a7 milanserravalle highway the result
of a collaboration between the palo altobased company autogrill and the milano
serravalle highway company these twelve stations will allow the free recharging of all

                                                and for this reason the group has undertaken several projects in the italian stores

factors to consider first the level of integration in the ecosystem defined through an
analysis of the different stages in the life cycle of the building the materials and the
equipment considering that the majority of the autogrill stores are located in high
traffic areas like airports and railway stations often these issues do not directly affect
autogrill but landlords

             note north america and the pacific region area are not included in the perimeter because workers in this area are classified pursuant to the
                   currently applicable legislation atwill employment and therefore it was not possible to classify them based on the two types of
                   contracts used at the european level this legislation envisages that either party can terminate the employment contract at any time
                   without any liability of either party
