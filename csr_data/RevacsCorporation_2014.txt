  the csr report from scratch without being                                     to me what is important for csr report is
  restricted by the style of the past issues we                              that it is prepared with the hands of as many
  started by asking ourselves who do you want                                people as possible and that it is read by peo
  to read our csr report                                                    ple with various interests interesting information
     at first we thought of general consumers and                             differs reader by reader depending on where
  students as our prospective readers because                                 heor she stands for this reason i would like
  we wanted as many people as possible know                                   the internship students to say directly what

               we perceive a proper operation of waste disposal business as a
               means of contribution to the solution of environmental problem
                  to us who engages in waste treatment it seems that the company itself
               as well as the efforts to properly deal with the waste in compliance with
               the laws and regulations have to do with the environmental issues and that
               such efforts will finally gain stakeholders reassurance and confidence in us

                  considering the nature of waste disposal business we make various approaches so as to have
               local residents or business entities around our facilities understand us such as publicizing of our
               treatment cite with webcamera images to say nothing of installation of deodorizing furnace and
               odor prevention shutters
                  ten years has passed since we obtained iso14001 certification environmental management sys
               tem meanwhile new employees have joined us it is time we explained them such basic matters
               as the reason why the management system is necessary why we are tackling with environmental
               management it is our task that we once again share the common understandings of the meaning
               of the environmental activity and continue downtoearth efforts with it

measures to prevent leakage and spill of the waste
  concrete floor of the shredding facility building is
entirely covered with iron plate to prevent waste from
leaking we have a permanent stock pile of sand
bags ready to stuff up the sewage discharge point
                                                                                                                                      documents

should the leakage be expected in a natural disaster
  when transporting waste of high moisture content
watertight container equipped with rubber gaskets is
used the rubber gaskets are regularly renewed to
prevent leakage from occurring

           odor prevention measures
              in various places we take steps to prevent
           bad smell of wastes in the shredding plant
           four units of activated carbonbased deodoriz
           ers have been installed the yard to hold
           sludge or plant and animal residues is
           equipped with shutters which are normally
           closed except when the waste is brought in or                    deodorizing equipment           deodorizing furnace
           brought out the drying plant has a deodoriz
           ing furnace to incinerate concentrated odor
           and a cleaning equipment to neutralize the
           odor of low concentration with chemicals the
           result of our odor measurement conducted
           based on the revacsnishinomiya environmen

water pollution control measures
  whole the waste water originated in the waste treatment process at the recycling center is
discharged into public sewerage after being treated in our water treatment facility to prevent
the abnormality of discharging water from occurring we have installed ph meter with continu
ous monitoring device and we weekly inspect the water to be discharged from the treatment




                                                                                                                                                  business management
facility we also conduct voluntary inspection of water quality concurrently with the municipal
monthly inspection the result is as follows every item cleared the regulation standard

 major impressions and opinions of the report
   the report sets importance on the opinions of the                                        opinions of employees and their families or
    third party as well it is far from a production of self                                stakeholders the editors might have had a kind of
    satisfaction i like it                                                                 difficulty to have it coexist with the sheer aspects
   i have had a favorable impression of revacs it                                          required of csr and environmental reports we have
    voluntarily tackles csr activities as its environment                                   learned something from the report
    related business operation with a sense of                                             it is readable with substantial content especially you      communication
    responsibility                                                                          have actively disclosed such information as                                        chapter 5
   present issue has become easier to read thanks to                                       complaints and accidents which usually a company
    the internship student mr yoshida s involvement                                     would not like to do i perceived a sort of
    appeal points to the readers are clearly shown if i                                     philosophy of the top executives revacs if i may
    dare say a little courage to select out information                                     add my request the report had rather adopted a
    would further improve the report                                                        larger font for sake of readability
   i enjoyed reading the report its content is warm                                      
    and persuasive as it runs many actual speeches or                                                                    circulation 7 000 copies
