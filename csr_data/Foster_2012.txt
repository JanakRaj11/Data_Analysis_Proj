     ecofriendly products
 vocreduction speaker unit

   adhesives are necessary to manufacture speaker units
 that often contain voc volatile organic compounds which
 are frequently harmful to human health
   we have established a new manufacturing process
 and succeeded in reducing total usage of adhesives and
 controlling voc emissions drastically




 lightweight speaker unit for vehicles

    the foster group succeeded in development of light
 weight speaker units for the electric vehicles that are viewed
 as the next generation of ecofriendly transportation we
 have already designed a lightweight speaker unit that
 weighs only 145 grams for a 16 cm diameter in addition to
 this positive result we succeeded in further reducing the
 weight by 10 percent which also contributes to a reduction
 in co2 emissions
   its frame is made of reinforced polypropylene pp ﬁbers
 we accomplished this production by minimum usage of
 materials while maintaining stability via optimum design
    the foster group uses adhesives that do not contain
 harmful solvents which leads to a reduction of total voc
 for the comfort in passenger cabins of vehicles
   the diaphragm and subcone which are also waterproof
 for vehicle use are made of recyclable paper



 headphones and head set

  the foster group actively feeds back its ecofriendliness
 policy in product and process design we roll out the
 policy of minimization for environmentally hazardous
 substances according to strict european standards energy
 management minimization of waste adoption of compact
 molds and recycling material through factory facilities are
 moving ahead we also produce diaphragms and housings
 made from biochemical materials
