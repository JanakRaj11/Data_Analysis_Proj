 tshirts for 5 swiss francs
such prices really do exist i wonder what the drivers behind such offers are and why consumption of
  the cheapest possible products is so widespread is this what customers really want in other words
is it purely a matter of demand or are such offers made in order to demonstrate that it is always
  possible to go cheaper still can you buy and wear such a tshirt and have a clear conscience
or is it simply that many of us are unaware of the true impact of our buying decisions

if price is all that counts it will be to the detriment of both our planet
  and all the persons involved in making a product the rampant
bargainhunting craze in wealthy and highly developed nations is
   particularly harmful to the poorest people in developing countries 
 once we accept that cotton farmers workers in spinning and knitting mills or dyeing units
   and also seamstresses are entitled to a decent income and have important human rights
 we need to be aware that this is certainly not possible at rockbottom prices

   this is precisely why any activity geared to sustainability is so incredibly important
the biore foundation has invested in the sustainable improvement of living conditions for farmer
 families in india and tanzania since 1997

   what does it take to stem the tide of bargainhunting and to secure future demand for
 our precious organic cotton products with significant added value are best promoted by demand
   from customers and farsightedness on the part of retailers and manufacturers people need
 to relearn to appreciate the true value of organic cotton and socially compatible and ecological
production which ought to be viewed as a meaningful alternative to the throwaway consumption that
   unfortunately does not have to cover the cost it generates for man and the earth to this end
we need to intensify customer information considerably because in the final analysis it is
    the customers who control supply through their demand

it is unreasonable to expect to get products with sustainable
  added value for the same cheap prices we must be willing to pay
more for added value our motto should be better rather than
  more and more i would like to thank everyone who appreciates
precious products with their added value and contributes to promoting
  them no matter how

  the biore foundation is promoting organic agriculture and is collaborating directly with
 smallholder farmers in india and tanzania this means we not only know our farmers but are
 also familiar with the challenges of their livelihoods unfortunate ly we are seeing that indian
  organic cotton farmers have increasingly limited access to nongeneticallymodified seeds more
 than 90  of the cotton seeds available on the local market are genetically modified nevertheless 
    over the past year biore india ltd has successfully opposed this development meanwhile
 our cotton seed research is revealing potential seeds for organic cotton farming

 we regard sustainable agriculture as an organism where constant efforts are needed to
   preserve the fragile balance between the various forces of nature for us this holistic
 approach forms the very basis of any ecologically sustainable and socially integrating development


genuine organic agriculture is yielding fruit
  biore tanzania ltd has completed a successful cotton season so far no genetically
 modified seeds have been introduced into tanzania on the contrary biore tanzania ltd
   has achieved promising results in testing a new cotton seed which shows a high
  potential in terms of productivity staple length and ginning out turn

  our social projects have continued to promote community building and to contribute to
 improved education and health services our animation schools in india were attended by
  953 children from remote farming villages additionally the newly established biore
     school campus is providing further education thus opening up future prospects for children
 meanwhile the construction of 77 water wells and 26 water tanks is guaranteeing
   clean drinking water for 34000 people in tanzania

     i would like to sincerely thank all of you who are supporting us with valuable donations and
  encouraging words the biore foundation is about connecting people and living in active dialogue
 with smallholder farmers it facilitates meetings between consumers and producers of organic
  cotton and acts as a bridge to the textile market thus this annual report has been
 created in the format of a textile design folder  thanks to the generous sponsorship of the
 ksp advertising agency we invite all of you to read the latest news on our
  biore projects and to continuously shape this dialogue

    biore sustainability index
     in tansania a four year survey was conducted with 114 organic farmers the results are
    integrated in a biore sustainability index in the ecological economic and social dimension
  the comprehensive approach enables to monitor the changes on the fields and farms via
  indicators and to promote continuous improvements of the organic farm practices and the yields

 the ecological dimension includes indicators such as soil fertility pest control and crop
   management the economic dimension is analysed based on yield potentials and actually
 generated income the social dimension contains social capital social projects investments
    housing cattle land and food security the biore sustainability index was developed
 in close collaboration with woodhouseledermann geoconsulting



          study shows
      organic cultivation is competitive
         with the gm cultivation
since 2007 a longterm system comparisons study is conducted which is analysing four
different cultivation systems biodynamic agriculture organic conventional and conventional
with genetically modified cotton is being compared in the cottonsoyawheat crop rotation
   this longterm system comparison trial is led by the research institute for organic
agriculture fibl and is implemented at biore association in india wwwsystemscomparisonfiblorg

 now the first publication was released yield and economic performance of organic and
   conventional cottonbased farming systems  results from a field trial in india
 2014 forster et al in this research paper it is analysed that after 4 years of the trial
 the organic cotton is competitive with the gm cultivation in detail it shows that although
   genetically modified cotton has higher yield it also requires higher production costs
specifically during the period 2007  2010 the organic cotton crops were 14 percent lower
on average but at the same time organic farming showed 38 percent lower production
    costs thus the biological production of cotton is as profitable as conventional cotton
  and in addition it protects the environment and the health of farmers organic soya
which is often used in the crop rotation with cotton has produced only 7 percent
  lower yields compared to conventional soya and while input costs in organic soya
cultivation are 66 percent lower profitability is higher

the problems with genetically
             modified organisms
in organic agriculture genetically modified plants are not allowed on the one hand there
     are ethical concerns shall anyone actively interfere in the dna sequence the plan of
each organism and change its characteristics does anyone want to change characteristics an
organism most probably would never achieve in a natural way which is the case in genetically
  modified cotton this cotton is called bt cotton because dna of bacillus thuringensis was
 integrated through these bt genes the plants are enabled to produce proteins which are
  transformed into toxins in the intestine of insects for cotton bollworms these toxins are
 deadly with regard to ethical questions organic regulations clearly state that such genetically
 modified organisms are not allowed

on the other hand the introduction of genetically modified organisms also creates ecological
 problems new organisms are created and released into an intact ecosystem without any
knowledge of longterm consequences specifically possible resistance of pests against
this toxin must be viewed critically furthermore it cannot be ensured that this toxin has
no harmful effects on other insects beneficiaries as well there is also a risk of secondary
pests becoming more dominant many unknown risks are related to the release of genetically
  modified organisms in organic farming pest problems are controlled through preventive
 measures such as crop rotation and intercropping or by natural organic preparations such
  as neem extract

farmer participation
    to prevent arbitrariness
 all persons shall have the freedom to develop and to participate in the development of their
  societies the core of fair trade is an ongoing process of discussion and negotiation to define
 this space for development organic farming supports the individual farmer allowing him
   to develop his farm and livelihood biore farmers are invited to participate in shaping both
 the biore organisations and the biore standard participation of farmers is guaranteed
 by the biore producer representative body moreover farmers elect representatives to
 the board of biore organisations this gives them the opportunity to make their voices heard
 and to promote a form of development in line with their own views and values

 organic farmer mangalsingh bhawar lives in the indian village of holimal in the maheshwar
 area he has been working with biore india since 2008 and was elected farmer representative
   for maheshwar centre in addition he is an elected board member on the managing
 committee of the biore association in the interview he is explaining his role as a farmer
   representative for organic farmers


 which topics do you discuss in producer representative body meetings
    i discuss all possible subjects related to biore farmers this includes seeds and input demand
  feedback from farmers farmers training sessions and the involvement of women purchase
    and quality issues and also payment to farmers and the recovery of input loans i also raise
  biore extension teams concerns such as issues related to border crops and crop rotation




                                                12

have you proposed any suggestions to the biore management
 being prb member and also of managing committee of biore association i have given
several suggestions to involve farmers in training and i am happy that all my suggestions
 were respected i have also given suggestion to biore india management this year that
   we should set up small scale biofertilizer and biopesticide making units i am happy
that biore is planning to set up a small organization with its farmers and employees
together to create something similar to my suggestion



  what has changed since the producer representative body was implemented
since the prb became active we have had regular meetings and our feedback and suggestions
 have been incorporated in management plans the prb is aware of all major business decisions
and farmers feel that matters are transparent the quality of seed has improved tremendously



what is your role as a prb member
i am representative of my village as well as my extension center maheshwar i feel responsible
towards my fellow farmers and company both sometimes i have to act as a bridge between both
  i feel proud member of biore and feel responsible in community for its image and work



what do your fellow farmers think about prb
     my fellow farmers feel happy that prb has really became a tool to present voice of
farmers and a platform where both farmers and management can talk openly on all subjects
  it has created transparency for all



 what do you know about the biore standard
  biore is committed to helping farmers the biore standard assists in this with biore we farmers
 get a purchase guarantee and a premium on our organic cotton biore is concerned to serve our
 people with social projects such as schools mobile hospitals biogas input credit and so on it has
  created a system of farmer representation which is good for the farmers involvement




                                                 13


entrepreneurship is a priority for biore organizations both in our livelihood projects and
 in our farmer communities a regular income provides the basis for selfsustainability and
enables farmers to feed their families producing a high quality product and working
and covering ones basic needs through a selfearned income similarly allow people to live
 in dignity the purchase guarantee offered by biore ensures market access for farmers
and gives them a secure income highlights from biore companies

     biore tanzania ltd
       great team performance
     last season we started with 1644 farmers and a total cotton acreage cultivated of 27869 acres 
   at the start of the season through our stringent internal controls we lost number of farmers
     due to their not fulfilling the standards further we discontinued beginning this season to work
   with the farmers association in maswa district with a total 596 farmers hence the number
   of farmers dropped drastically from the previous season season 20132014 we continued to work
   with our own registered farmers in meatu district

      due to better rains during the season the yield went up to 327 kg per acre total yield
    estimates were 9113 tons of organic seed cotton and we procured 80  of the yield from our
   farmers during purchase of seed cotton the team had a negligible loss of 010  and
    i would like to commend them well done job

   the declared floor price was  cents 4400 per kg at the end of the season the prices averaged
   out at  cents 4800 per kg however our organic farmers earned  cent 5400 including premium

  during the season there were various training programs organized for the farmers as well as
  the staff prior to cultivation trainings were focused on crop rotation sowing in rows and intercropping
   with legumes participatory training programs introduced earlier continued to take place with
  both farmers and field staff alike

   a new variety of seeds identified as ukm08 has been developed by the ukiriguru research centre
  this is believed to produce higher yield and better fibre quality parameters we have requested
  a certain quantity of these ukm08 seeds from the tanzania cotton board so that we can multiply
   them and be selfsufficient with this variety in a couple of years

  community development activities continued with generous support from the biore foundation
    switzerland coop remei ag and other donors for which the community as well as the biore
   tanzania  biore foundation tanzania are ever grateful

biore india ltd rejuvenating
                 and moving ahead
  at the start of 2013  14 biore india underwent major restructuring after the setback of gm
contamination traced inhouse in last years crop management changes were implemented and
mr vivek rawal was made ceo of the company nearly 2000 farmers who were unsure about planting
nongm cotton as opposed to gm cotton were taken out of the project after prolonged discussions with
  the producer representative body new farmers were added to the project and a process of organic
cotton pocket development was initiated 3233 farmers were registered with biore during this season

extension and ics departments are backbone of the organization and there was also major
  change in employee profile in year 2013  14 new team of extensionists was employed after
six months intensive training on organic farming

there was an immense improvement in seed procurement and seed quality proactive agreements
  with reputed seed companies were done to ensure supply of quality non gm seeds for farmers
at the same time non gm cotton seed research was continued to ensure selfsustainability in
seed in long run farmers were involved in decision making on all crucial subjects special
  efforts were made to communicate with farmers the position of biore on gm contamination and
   support from our clients to come out of this problem all these efforts resulted in several positive
  impacts and changes biore india brought gm contamination to nearly 0 within one year
yield of cotton were increased due to good quality seeds

biore india management started several small initiatives to help farmers and create midterm
and longterm business opportunities soya export was started in a big way and nearly 800 tons
of soya was procured from farmers and sold in domestic and international market new links to
promote alternative food crops were developed biore india started its first certified seed production for
non gm cotton organic soya and organic wheat this year special programme of producing organic
short staple cotton was initiated and same was marketed successfully a total of 390 tons of organic
lint was produced in the last season

biore india ltd is marching again on the path of success after setbacks of year
 2012  13 gmo still remains major threat to our organization and also for the whole
region we are fighting with gmo by rejuvenating our project and increased

        water projects in tanzania
       water wells and water tanks are contributing greatly to improved drinking water
         in tanzanian villages in the course of last year nine new water wells were
       constructed since the beginning of the project 77 water wells have provided safe
       drinking water for 24000 people the construction of 6 water tanks highlights
       the benefits of the total of 26 water tanks built at schools where more than
        10000 children and teachers are profiting from them




compensation of 12694 tons of co2
the impact of the biogas and efficient stoves project is visible in the kitchens of farmhouses
where open smoke formation has now been successfully prevented and as a result the health
of the household members is no longer affected our co2 projects are mostly financed by biore
  customers investing in emission reduction projects since 2013 all biore organic cotton
products have been co2neutral because of offsetting through biogas and efficient stoves in
  india and tanzania in total 3238 biogas stoves and 3810 efficient stoves were in
operation last year while biogas stoves have a success rate of more than 90  we faced problems
in the construction of indian stoves the number of wellfunctioning stoves in india dropped
  from 3436 to 2840 whereas 600 stoves are broken bear in mind that a broken stove in india
is more than just a technical defect it is symbolic of a broken family against this cultural
background it was not possible to repair those stoves because the families affected removed them
  the tanzania stove model is using bricks and clay and therefore is easier to repair the
tanzanian stove project has big potential for expansion because of high demand for efficient
stoves in the community and because of the level of co2 compensation per stove 335 t per stove

     human rights organic cotton 
            purpose of the biore foundation
we have realized that organic farming is a solid basis
for a healthy social organism
					patrick hohmann founder of the biore foundation
the biore foundation aims at promoting organic farming especially in cotton growing regions
 and at supporting smallholder farmers through projects facilitating infrastructure development
and capital creation we envision human rights as the basis for sustainable development human
 rights organic cotton rests on an approach that takes in two different aspects on the one
hand we claim freedom for every single human being to develop in a healthy living environment
and on the other hand we have the conviction that our way of life has to ensure that
 generations to come will also be able to lead a healthy life this approach strongly intertwines
ecological balance and integrative social development

 focusing on organic farming our projects promote local infrastructure and agriculture thus
    contributing to the attainment of human rights in different domains such as ecology
  right to ecology education right to education health right to health and livelihood
right to work and development in the long run our projects aim to guarantee the farmers
  livelihood in an intact environment ultimately they are thus intended to secure the
fundamental human right to lead a decent life in dignity for small scale farmers and their
families too it is the independence and autonomy of individual human beings which is
at the centre of this endeavour biore farmers are at the same time entrepreneurs who
through their income from a healthy and biologically diverse agriculture assure the maintenance
  of schools wells and medical care at the same time they also develop additional earnings
from various other projects
