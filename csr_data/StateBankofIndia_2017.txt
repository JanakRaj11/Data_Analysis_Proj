       dear reader

       responsible banking the bank is determined to contribute further to the sustainable future of the country


       over time the notion of sustainability has become associated separately with key concepts such as social responsibility
       environmental management and business sustainability academics industry leaders and experts are in agreement that
       sustainability cannot be achieved through isolated initiatives but through integrated efforts at various levels in todays world the
       concept of integrated sustainability has emerged this concept recognizes the importance of interconnection between social
       environmental and economic paradigms of business


       integrating sustainability into the business can provide several benefits and create sustainable value across the organization for
       instance while it could include revenue growth through early market entry into socioenvironmental business opportunities it could
       also lead to enhanced employment generation it could not only help the organisation mitigate short medium and long term
       regulatory risks but at the same time ensure natural resource conservation and reduction in environmental load this can further
       lead to enhanced efficiency and cost saving for the organisation




                                                                                      continuing with our legacy of

access to quality education is one of the key indices that indicate the extent of development in any country in india providing
quality education to people who cannot afford private schooling has been a challenge due to a growing population and lack of
available resources further a significant dearth of proper infrastructure quality teaching staff and social barriers linked with
educating girls are also important issues that continue to be obstacles to counter these issues the foundation is working
relentlessly to provide education facilities to those who are deprived of it some initiatives towards this objective are



beti padhao kendras girl child education
in 5 states


the objective behind this project is to educate girls in
remote rural areas where there are no formal schools
the project has been implemented in partnership with
an ngo which has helped establish 200 learning
centers under the name beti padhao kendra in
remote rural areas of bihar chhattishgarh madhya
pradesh odisha and uttarakhand around 6000 girls
are enrolled in these kendras


setting up digital classrooms in four states


in many remote rural areas of the country schools
lack the basic technology and infrastructure required
for learning committed to transforming the learning
environment for children in rural areas the
foundation has established digital classrooms in four
states

and the digital classrooms have both improved the
effectiveness in learning and proved to be
instrumental in increasing enrolment of students in
