sustainability targets they tackle the five most material issues for our business are the latest evolution of
sabmillers approach to sustainable development and a key element of our business strategy

these targets include commitments to support small businesses deliver worldclass water efficiency and cut our
total carbon footprint they are imperatives because they are urgent compelling and essential to our future
success and shared because we dont face them alone and will only address them through sharing our local
knowledge and collaborating through innovative partnerships with suppliers customers consumers

the world consumers are responding very differently to branding than in the past years
people are being bombarded so much with all kind of information that they have
adapted to deselect automatically most of the messages out there

the power has shifted from brand owners to the billions of individual consumers
wanting to find meaning in a 24hday connected world

in this context the only effective way for a brand to be noticed and understood is to speak
not about itself but about the people it is addressing about what they need about what
they care

small brands will become great by taking on great causes and big brands will disappear
if they dont because causes and positions are the talk currency of today determining the
leaders of the future

they will be scrutinized more than ever about every ingredient place of production
manufacturing process employee benefit and public statement because people will
need to be sure that the brands they will usepromote are really representing their beliefs

this is why at ursus breweries we reflect deeper on the good causes that our brands must
support and strive to embed them in their dna we believe this is the way to long term
sustainability in the mutual benefit of our business our consumers and the environment
in which we operate

context
in its biennial white book9 the foreign investors council fic indicates
that the increased private consumption in 2014 was mainly driven by
the 18 percent rise of the minimum wage coupled with the interest
rate cuts moreover the economic activity continued its moderate
growth reaching a 26 percent rate the strongest growth was
recorded in the first and third quarters of 2014 another
positive element is the flat 16 percent corporate income tax
and the 5 percent reduction of the employers social
security contribution

on the other hand the beer industry faced significantly
                                                        10
different challenges as the annual report for 2014 
conducted by the brewers of romania emphasize the
beer market contracted significantly due to consumers
low incomes and lack of trust in the state of the economy
the fiscal pressures and the unfavorable weather during
summer it is estimated that the beer consumption
contracted by over 10 compared to 2012 which has led to a
10 million euro decrease of the investment budgets in 2013

data released by the worldbank11 show that 20 percent of
romanians are income poor and about 5 percent of the population
cannot afford to purchase a minim consumption level of products and
services as rural households have a 3time higher risk of becoming poor and
the aging population with low income is increasing the demand has limited
chances to rise significantly by its nature the current business climate in
romania involves risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control one area
that is of concern to fic member companies is the continuing problem of
legislation being passed quickly often at very short notice and with little time for the business community to have
effective input another is that tax inspectors change frequently their law interpretation in practice according to
fic rules can change unpredictably and dramatically also according to the brewers of romania ensuring fiscal
predictability fair fiscal treatment in the category of fermented drinks and applying measures that foster the
development of this sector should certainly become priorities for the romanian authorities

last but not least as one of our shared imperatives relates to smes we need to also include a reference to the fics
analysis which says the following many of the traditional problems facing romanian smes lack of financing
difficulties in taking advantage of technology constrained managerial capabilities low productivity and
regulatory burdens have become more acute in a globalized technologydriven environment

all aspects included in this chapter refer to issues identified as material for voluntary sustainability reporting that
could impact our local sustainability performance

as a result of an extensive and multilayered consultation process that engaged top executives employees
managers union representatives business partners ngos local authorities academia regulators and
independent specialists we have identified 30 sustainability priority issues of which 15 resulted as the most
material to our business the details of the stakeholder engagement process and the materiality matrix are
publicly available and can be consulted in our 20132014 sustainable development report12




                                                   four of them  taxes direct and indirect economic
                                              performance and corporate governance  are covered in this

            i am delighted to see that there is a growing concern among companies operating in
            romania to conduct their business in a sustainable way and especially to strengthen the
            relationship they have with stakeholders i appreciate the commitment of ursus
            breweries to reinforce transparency and enhance communication with stakeholders by
            publishing the second sustainable development report conducted according to g4
            guidelines issued by the global reporting initiative gri thus providing a credible
            source of information and a relevant content for the need of information of all those
            interested in the activity and in the economic social and environmental performances of
            the company

            in the context of nonfinancial reporting standards preparation based on the g4 gri
            guide i believe that the effort of ursus breweries team who conducted this report
            earned its appreciation being an important step in aligning with the best existing
            practices at international level and facilitating the adoption of these standards

            the route from the agony of planning the reporting process to the euphoria of launching
            the report is never simple but the results are accordingly so far in romania those who
            passed through this experience are not many but i hope that this report constitutes an
            encouragement for other companies to adopt ursus breweries example

risks and uncertainties
operational challenges could stem from the regulatory reset in the area of packaging waste recycling this arrives
in a context where romanian market has been confronted with the partial blockage of the packaging waste
recycling system

another challenge that the company is facing consists in ab inbev takeover bid over sabmiller plc ab inbev
made a formal offer to acquire sabmiller on 11 november 2015 and the sabmiller board has stated that it intends
to recommend that shareholders vote to accept the cash offer it will take many months before the shareholder
votes happen as there are many countries in which regulatory approvals are needed first both companies remain
competitors until the transaction closes a potential delay of incompletion of the transaction could result in an
adverse effect on our business and financial results

energy efficiency continues to be of concern in romania says the worldbank17 which identified two additional
challenges of the market securing a reliable and cleaner energy supply and maintaining energy affordability in
terms of energy supply fossil fuels account for 77 percent of the primary supply with the natural gas representing
about 40 percent of all fossil fuels

as far as the climate is concerned the worldbank warns that romania is already experiencing significant impacts
warming included also the frequency of droughts and floods is a risk that is likely to increase in the future

sustainability involves economic development which respects longterm environmental and social wellbeing
and corporate social responsibility csr says the fic18 although there are some positive initiative  such as the
national strategy on social responsibility 20112016 and the national sustainable development strategy 2013
20202030  there is a need for a closer cooperation between authorities and relevant stakeholders for the
successful implementation of the two documents

all aspects included in this chapter refer to issues identified as material for voluntary sustainability reporting that
could impact our local sustainability performance

as a result of an extensive and multilayered consultation process that engaged top executives employees
managers union representatives business partners ngos local authorities academia regulators and
independent specialists we have identified 30 sustainability priority issues of which 15 resulted as the most
material to our business the details of the stakeholder engagement process and the materiality matrix are
publicly available and can be consulted in our 20132014 sustainable development report21

one of the biggest challenges we face is to develop a sustainable business model we work on reducing
environmental impacts in all our sites continually take steps to improve our performance and strive to efficiently
use water to monitor the quality of discharges to optimize waste treatment to lower our emission levels and
improve our energy efficiency in the same time we need to achieve sustainable and competitive economic
development




                    all our employees are informed on our sustainable development initiatives especially
                    our employees working in breweries on reducing utilities such as water and carbon
                    emissions although everything is communicated via email sustainable development
                    reports are precious and useful materials mostly due to their benefit of centralizing
                    information and data

we continue to rely on sam our sustainability assessment matrix for recording analyzing monitoring and
consolidating environmental performance sam is available to all our sites via our intranet enabling our staff to
upload and validate our environmental key performance indicators we apply a common methodology for this
throughout all our businesses which is included in the companys guide to environmental parameters and is
based on internationallyrecognized documents and guidelines used in the our industry

                                  the last major capacity expansion program was completed in 2009 after
                                  which brewery management commenced their utilities improvement
                                  program all optimization initiatives and new technologies implemented
                                  in buzau brewery were designed to minimize negative impact on the
                                  environment and the local communities

                                  two initiatives were identified as being the most relevant and were
                                  implemented accordingly
                                  1 equipment  processes optimisation the main focus areas were
                                  identified as better measurement through improved metering cleaning in
                                  place process optimisation energy recovery system upgrade and
                                  refrigeration plant optimisation
                                  2 new technology implementation to minimize utilities loss
                                  a reverse osmosis plant upgrade to increase overall yield
                                  b service water preheating to increase energy utilisation from the
                                  cogeneration plant




the utilities usage reduction in buzau brewery demonstrates our values and our leadership behaviors in action
its positive impact reflects in important savings and increased efficiency and it is driven by our constant
preoccupation for a resilient and clean world all optimization initiatives and new technologies implemented in
buzau brewery are a result of a strong collaboration between local teams and european subject matter expert task
forces they have a tremendous transferrable learning potential for other sabmiller breweries and malting plants
with similar technology and operational contexts i am confident great things will follow

one of the positive developments of the romanian labour market as identified by the foreign investors council23
is the increased number of active employees by 7 percent about 300000 new employees

according to the brewers of romania the beer sector is certainly a driver of added value and jobs for more than
one sector of the local economy from agriculture transport utilities equipment media and advertising to
packaging or hospitality industry therefore the impacts that the beer industry are facing are also reflected in
these related sectors number of jobs included

in line with the europe 2020 strategy says the worldbank24 romania needs to achieve an employment rate of 70
percent by 2020 however warns fic illegal employment continues to be a significant problem the fiscal
council quoted by the fic estimates that over 15 million people are working on the black market in order to
address this we must address high school dropout and the access to highquality and relevant opportunities
these affect the labor market in general as well as our business in particular as we need wellqualified employees
both in our offices as well as in our breweries

regrettably we need to report that an employee of a subcontractor had an accident and suffered a fatal injury we
continue to improve our health and safety procedures in order to identify specific risks and introduce corrective
measures with periodic controls we will further plan preventive actions in order to eliminate hazards include
additional emergency measures and risk surveillance activities both collective and individual

we have a set of ethical principles  transparency business integrity respect  that are fundamental to us we treat
all people equitably and with respect while providing both employees and contractors with a safe working
environment we reward our employees fairly by providing a range of benefits together with opportunities to
reach their potential and enjoy long fulfilling careers

we also work in partnership with communities improving the quality of life in each of the communities we
operate we contribute resources and encourage our employees to participate in activities that benefit the
communities

we have once again organized our employees participation in the largest countrywide oneday cleanup
initiative lets do it romania which has as major objective the collection of waste dumped in public spaces
mainly in protected areas in september 2014 334 of our employees based in bucharest timisoara brasov buzau
and clujnapoca collected over 1100 bags full of waste

                in a nutshell this is what we try to do in ursus breweries from a human resources
                perspective bringing the right people together putting them in the right teams and make
                sure they benefit of all premises on our behalf to grow a great career this is most
                certainly a challenging process and i admit sometimes a bit difficult as well but we

sustainability is becoming increasingly important more and more companies being assessed against their level of
transparency as well as environmental and social responsibility however as a research of the romanian centre
of european policies crpe29 indicates there is small number of organizations in romania 58 that disclose non
financial information ie environmental and social data of those crpe analyzed 24 companies that are
considered as reporting champions on deciding to disclose nonfinancial information companies quoted two
main reasons a higher transparency of the company 79 percent and a better visibility 38 percent




                   corporate social responsibility csr is about the individual performance of a company
                   when it comes to responsible business conduct and this is why a company should have
                   enough flexibility to innovate design and implement its own csr policies the private
                   sector therefore naturally becomes the most critical partner in implementing csr

                      result of the public consultation the csr strategy of the european commission




ursus breweries is one of the companies that voluntarily reports its nonfinancial performance and has been
engaged in this practice long before the eu directive on nonfinancial reporting to be a topic on the agenda
moreover ursus breweries participated in the study conducted by crpe and is also one of the 10 companies to
also contribute with expertise and information via dedicated interviews for the making of the study moreover
we have been engaged in a consistent promotion of the best practice of reporting itself

ÿ reporting our nonfinancial performance on a yearly basis for the 4th year in a row

ÿ actively embracing the path of participating and pushing the csr agenda through direct involvement in
  business to business projects

ÿ having participated at the first gri g4 training in romania

ÿ actively promoting the gri g4 reporting both via our employees as well as via the direct involvement of the
  presidents company in leaders for sustainable business conference organized by community relations
  association

on one hand there are already 2 key documents a national strategy on promoting social responsibility
promotion 20112016 ncsr as well as a national sustainable development strategy nsd for 201320202030
on the other hand publicly available data on the implementation of the two strategies is limited while
cooperation between authorities business community and other stakeholders would be nevertheless necessary

currently according to fic only listed companies are required to disclose some nonfinancial information
although the number of companies that would be subject to the eu directive 952014 is significantly larger multi
stakeholder dialogue is crucial such as fic emphasizes both in the implementation process and technical inter
ministerial working groups aimed at further developing ncsr and nsd strategies and on specific sustainable
development issues

           the adoption of the directive on mandatory

           parliament is a useful measure in developing
           a transparent business model focused on

                   have changed and they are focusing now on minimising the social and environmental
                   impact of business operations in the very near future we are going to realise that there is
                   more to business success than financial profit alone

                   in light of the overall trend in business towards transparency honesty and
                   accountability i find the objectives of ursus breweries as outlined in their sustainability

there is no simple solution to addressing harmful consumption of alcohol however there are things that could
make a difference such as making sure that information about alcohol is accurate and balanced supporting
enforced laws against drinkdriving underage drinking and helping people that are at risk

making a difference also requires a joint effort on behalf of us and our stakeholders many of these actions are best
designed and implemented at a local level as they reflect our local culture and social concerns we can grow
sustainably only if our work and brands resonate with the values of our consumers

                                    implementing effective strategies it is only by acting together that the
                                    serious issues related to harmful drinking can be addressed and we seek to
