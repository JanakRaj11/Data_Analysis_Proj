4 reasons why recupel shifted
into higher circular gear in 2016

its become a sheer necessity that we as a society take the path of the circular economy recupel noted when
it celebrated its 15th birthday in 2016


the growing mountain of waste and the increasing scarcity of raw materials are of such a nature that the
circular economy and urban mining are no longer optional ceo peter sabbe concluded in 2016 at recupels
15th birthday party  theyve become a necessity the raw materials we extract from electrical and electronic
waste no longer have to be taken from the earth



1   the fastest growing type of waste in the world
     every year electronic waste grows by another 4 to 5 a rate that makes it the fastest growing type of
     waste in the world worldwide in 2016 around 46 million tonnes of electronic waste were generated as
     calculated by the global ewaste monitor of the united nations ie around 63 kg for every inhabitant of
     the planet


2   hazardous substances remain present
     however hazardous substances are often integrated into many devices as testaankoop recalled once
     again in 2016  the pipes of refrigerators contain gases that are highly dangerous washing machines
     sometimes contain toxic pcbs and the screens of old tvs almost always contain heavy metals it is vitally
     important that we not let these substances get away their proper removal and processing before
     recycling ie depollution is thus of enormous value


3   raw material scarcity
     in addition it is also becoming economically ever more important to recover as many elements from
     outdated electronics as possible metals such as cobalt or cadmium for example are primarily found in
     mines in congo and zambia where they are extracted under very dubious circumstances and without any
     concern for the environmental impact metals such as gold silver and copper also are increasingly difficult
     to extract yet can be found  easily accessible  in many electronic devices this scarcity was felt even more
     strongly in 2016 which further increased the importance of electrorecycling

4   the invisible kilos
     according to the most recent figures each and every belgian generates 224 kg of electrical and electronic
     waste on an annual basis in the meantime almost half of this  around 10 kg  is being properly collected
     by the recupel network for reuse or recycling these 102 kg are thus guaranteed not to end up
     somewhere in africa or asia where as testaankoop describes people attempt in a very rudimentary
     way to collect the most valuable electronic components with all the attendant consequences for their own
     health and for the environment it is thus very important to better map out those still invisible kilos in
     order to be able to guarantee that they are properly collected and recycled as well


in brief reasons enough for recupel to shift into higher gear in 2016 and collect more electrical and electronic
equipment than ever before by combining the expansion of the collection network recupel with targeted
campaigns for lamps and small electrical appliances we have once again taught the right habits to a significant
group of belgians says sabbe  you dont just throw electrical and electronic waste away you bring it in to us


     by 2016 urban mining was no longer an option
     it has become a necessity

2 awareness raising

in 2016 belgians became more aware than ever
of the importance of urban mining

with things like an action to raise the awareness of students a new website two largescale media
campaigns a further increase in the number of stores having become collection points and an active
pr component recupel in 2016 was able to make the belgians more aware than ever of the increasing
importance of the proper collection and reprocessing of electrical and electronic waste



to begin with in 2016 work was done on positioning recupel in the area of public relations and public affairs
with the intention of leveraging its name recognition and highlighting the organisations social importance to
accomplish this recupel has joined forces with many other organisations and institutions that have shown
an interest in or are associated with recycling urban mining and the circular economy after all a proper
understanding of the ewaste problematic and the activities of recupel by as many stakeholders as possible is of
great importance for guaranteeing a further positive evolution of recupels activities the concrete result of this
increased attention for media relations has already been a sharp increase in the number of newspaper articles
radio interviews and tv reports devoting attention to recupels important role in electrorecycling in belgium


café recupel
     in order to specifically raise the awareness of the belgian student population in 2016 recupel opened
     café recupel for this action where students get the chance to bring in electrical and electronic waste
     in an easily accessible way we collaborated intensively with recycling shops and the intermunicipal utility
     companies both are mentioned in the communications about each event and are present on site in order
     to check the devices brought in for their reuse potential thus in 2016 six cafés were organised distributed
     across the countrys three regions apart from the collection of old electrical and electronic equipment
     this initiative also generated a good deal of media attention

recupels new website
   in addition recupels new website was launched in 2016 this has been further elaborated as the
   basic platform for recupels contact with consumers and companies in coming years moreover our
   own channels will be receiving a more important role in external communication in 2016 the digital
   communication efforts were already recognised with a digital marketing award in the nonprofit category
   like most organisations recupel is digitising more and more aspects of its operation this ensures greater
   efficiency but also requires a certain vigilance in this context in 2016 recupel decided to have an ethical
   hacking conducted on its it systems a test that was successfully concluded


   finally it appears from the 2016 collection figures that the media campaigns focusing on small electrical
   and electronic devices and lamps were also well worth the effort the use your head and lamp ladies
   campaigns had a measurable effect that was significantly reinforced by the combination with the expansion
   of the recyclepoints  recognisable collection points at visible locations in store chains and retail when we
   look at the tonnage almost 10 more small electrical and electronic devices were collected and 5 more
   lamps than the preceding year in 2016 the quantity of collected equipment went up 20 and over 21
   respectively


   collection points and campaigns lifted the quantity
   of collected small electrical and electronic devices by 20

3 collection results

in 2016 32 million discarded devices
found their way to reuse or recycling

in 2016 recupel collected more electrical and electronic equipment than ever before thus staying at the
head of the electrorecycling pack in europe in 2016 102 kg per inhabitant was collected or a total of
more than 32 million devices to which a cord is attached or which run on batteries these are increases
of respectively 053 kg and 52 million devices compared to 2015


as expected in 2016 recupel collected fewer cathoderay screens  reflecting the simple fact that there are
fewer and fewer old tvs and monitors 92 in circulation  but in all other categories more equipment was
collected than in 2015


big white and cooling and freezing appliances showed an unmistakeable increase but it was above all the
collection of lamps and small electrical and electronic devices that was a success  the quantity of collected
pieces of the latter rose by 214 and 201 respectively the category other among which small electrical
and electronic devices is the most rapidly rising type of electrical and electronic waste recupel expects that
this trend will continue in the coming years and we will therefore continue to focus on the collection of small
electrical and electronic equipment




           evolution of electrical and electronic equipment collected by recupel per fraction 20032016

sinds de oprichting van recupel 15 jaar geleden werden overigens al 221417278 toestellen ingezameld samen
goed voor meer dan 13 miljoen ton zo werd naar aanleiding van het jubileum in 2016 berekend cijfers die de
32 miljoen toestellen van 2016 nog extra glans geven


out of market  put on market




                             put on market pom vs out of market via recupel oom


in the meantime in belgium 41 of the volume of electrical and electronic devices that are put on market pom
find their way out of market oom via the recupel system this makes our country amongst the most efficient in
the world by 2019 however all member states of the european union are obliged to collect 65 of the volume
of electrical and electronic devices that are put on the market for reuse or recycling


naturally recupel will therefore continue to promote collection says recupel ceo peter sabbe  but together
with the other social players we also want to better map out the ewaste flows in the coming years for some of
the 59 of electrical and electronic devices that for the moment are not taken out of market via recupel today
we have a pretty good idea of what happens with it  it is for example reported in individual plans that it is mixed
with scrap waste or leaves belgium via legal and illegal export however we have no idea where that remaining
30 ends up

a study conducted in 2014 in collaboration with the united nations university showed that in belgium each year
224 kg of electrical and electronic waste was generated per inhabitant over 10 kg of this was officially collected
and registered 51 kg was documented but nothing is known about the remaining 68 kilos  it thus remains
a top priority in the coming years as well to get a better view of this together with government authorities the
distribution sector producers and recyclers peter sabbe concludes


moreover the fact that there is still so much room for growth in the area of the collection of old electrical and
electronic equipment was highlighted in 2016 in numerous messages that circulated in the social media thanks
to recupel from an average flemish family has 77 electronic appliances at home ranging from the refrigerator
and the clothes iron to a small digital weather station or a sanding machine in het nieuwsblad to recupel
estimates that another million unused laptops are lying around gathering dust in belgian homes and one in
five coffee machines stand unused in the kitchen cabinet on twitter


     41 of the volume of electrical and electronic equipment that is put
     on the market is collected via recupel for reuse or recycling

4 collection network

the number of recylepoints
passed the threshold of 2000 in 2016

in 2016 the recycling parks remained the collection channel with the largest volume but it was above
all the recyclepoints mainly in stores that gained in importance  fortunately not at the expense of the
other collection channels the chain also passed an independent test with flying colours in 2016


in 2016 recupel could once again guarantee that a properly collected electrical or electronic device would
reach the proper destination via the chain the chains functioning was independently tested by the consumer
organisation testaankoop and the results of that study proved as expected a success for recupel an excerpt


     we brought a washing machine into the container park in vorst reported carine deschamps and paul nies in test
     aankoop in october 2016 and scarcely six days later it was already processed into metal and plastic after having made a
     trip of scarcely 50 kilometres to belgian electric electronic recycling in willebroek efficient two of the four refrigerators
     were also quickly disassembled  one after five days another after six days at that moment they had travelled just over
     100 kilometres the one refrigerator was brought directly from the container park in vorst to recydel in liège while the
     other was brought in at tournai was then stored for several days in a warehouse in mouscroun in order to then be
     processed by cornet sambre in mons

     1 october 2016 p 2224


recupel is very pleased about the fact that the success of the
recyclepoints did not come at the expense of other collection
channels because this shows that recyclepoints not only
increase the collection comfort for consumers but also that
these consumers are beginning to adopt interesting new discard
habits even if in 2016 the recycling parks remained the collection
channel with the largest overall volume moreover the comfort of
consumers and companies is also increased through the search
function on the website which was updated in 2016 where you can
now very easily find the nearest collection point

in 2016 the number of recyclepoints passed the threshold of 2000 with 2004 active recyclepoints throughout
belgium which are also being used ever more intensively a study showed that 40 of consumers find the
recyclepoints to be a good supplement to the recycling park the expansion of the recyclepoint network led
to an increase in the number of pickups per month and recent figures demonstrate that the recyclepoints
caused the quantity of collected small electrical and electronic devices to increase by several thousand tonnes in
2016 compared to the previous year one mustnt forget that the recyclepoints were only introduced in 2014
by the end of 2015 there were already more than 1500 distributed throughout the country and in 2016 thus
more than 2000 in terms of collection network belgium can confidently toss its hat in the ring for the title of
worlds best urban miner




     also in terms of collection network belgium can confidently compete
     for the title of worlds best urban miner

5 recycling figures

recycled electrical and electronic equipment
good for 82000 tonnes of raw materials in 2016

in 2016 recupel may justifiably call itself the belgian urban mining expert for old electrical and
electronic equipment  and this not only in terms of collection but also with regard to the processing of
ewaste into new raw materials


collected devices are first depolluted by recupelcertified recyclers freed of their harmful substances and then
optimally processed into new raw materials this process is a vital link in the circular economy


in this way an average of between 80 and 90 of an electrical and electronic device becomes new raw
material thus in 2016 a total of more than 82000 tonnes of raw materials could be used for the production
of new devices raw materials that therefore no longer have to be extracted from the earth via classic mining
including 46259 tonnes of recycled ferrous material and 12880 tonnes of recycled plastic


in 2016 manual depollution  in which the social economy plays a major role  assured that 12500 tonnes of
harmful substances such as mercury cfc and fluorescent powders did not find their way into the environment


and then there were also the 1410000 collected devices that didnt need to be disassembled because they
could be sent directly to the reuse circuit that is a sharp increase compared to 2015 which is due to the ever
greater reuse of smaller electronic devices an evolution that certainly favours our societys sustainability

and by the way parallel to these excellent recycling figures is a similar increase in employment in the recycling
sector for example sector federation go4circle is reporting a striking rate of job growth for the period 2011
2016 joint committee 142 which can be regarded as a representative sample of the recycling sector notes an
increase in employment of 117  including 6 in 2016 alone


and the growth is the most striking in the category of various materials the recycling of plastic tyres glass
and so on accounts for over 38 more employees above all semi and unskilled bluecollar workers get
opportunities in this branch a group that is finding fewer and fewer openings in other sectors observes
go4circle


     1410000 collected devices didnt even have to be dismantled
     because they were fit for reuse

6 annual balance sheet

recupel could further reduce the reserves in 2016

in 2016 a total of around 17 million in contributions were collected the total operating costs amounted
to around 42 million most of the costs could still be financed with the reserves


the total financial reserves provisions and working reserves built up through a cautious determination of the
initial contributions are thus being systematically further reduced the objective remains to arrive at a payas
yougo system whereby the recupel contribution belonging to an appliance fully covers the costs of collecting
transporting and recycling that same appliance


a security fund must guarantee recupels continuity in the event of a worsening market situation such as
disadvantageous fluctuations in raw material prices falling sales figures or other external factors


it is important to take into account that the graph below consolidates the data of 7 separate recupel entities all
representing a specific sector their funds are not linked to each other and the amount of financial reserves is
different for each entity the proportion between the different financial means also differs widely between the
sectors

7 member satisfaction

attention to services continued
to yield results in 2016 as well

the relationship with members and the distribution sector was again studied in 2016 this survey
revealed that recupels constant attention to an optimal provision of services continues to yield results
which didnt stop the surveys from also being used as an efficient source for defining action items in
order to ensure continuous improvement of the system


among other things the member survey demonstrated that the tollfree 0800 numbers and the online contact
form are continuing to gain in popularity amongst the recupel members both knowledge about 68 and
use of 42 the 0800 numbers in order to contact the departments inside recupel have already increased
significantly and the online contact form also scored well


members increasingly choose the website for verifying the recupel contribution that applies to a particular
appliance 78 compared to 72 in 2015 and more than 90 of the members who used the website say
they found the information they were looking for like last year twothirds of the members are satisfied to
very satisfied about both the reporting app available online and the invoicing itself the auditing procedure
was also positively evaluated members were informed in good time and received the opportunity to formulate
comments that were then correctly followed up


the survey of distributors revealed that virtually all of the distributors know recupel their customers are neutral
to positive concerning the contribution only a limited number of distributors indicate that they get questions
from customers about the recupel contribution


in addition the survey indicates that surprisingly few distributors 33 use the recupel website we take that
figure as an important point of attention for the coming years above all because it appears that 9 out of 10
distributors who do use the website find what theyre looking for in coming years we will continue to invest in a
smooth circulation of information to the distribution sector both via our own channels such as the website and
emailings and via the channels of our partners


finally the survey zooms in on the distributors who actively work together with recupel as a pickup point the
satisfaction remains high in this group as well 9 out of 10 pickup points are satisfied to very satisfied about the
collaboration with recupel on average they give recupel a score of 810
