1 intro 4 reason recupel shifted higher circular gear 2016 become sheer necessity society take path circular economy recupel noted celebrated 15th birthday 2016 growing mountain waste increasing scarcity raw material nature circular economy urban mining longer optional ceo peter sabbe concluded 2016 recupels 15th birthday party theyve become necessity raw material extract electrical electronic waste longer taken earth 1 fastest growing type waste world every year electronic waste grows another 4 5 rate make fastest growing type waste world worldwide 2016 around 46 million tonne electronic waste generated calculated global ewaste monitor united nation ie around 63 kg every inhabitant planet 2 hazardous substance remain present however hazardous substance often integrated many device testaankoop recalled 2016 pipe refrigerator contain gas highly dangerous washing machine sometimes contain toxic pcbs screen old tv almost always contain heavy metal vitally important let substance get away proper removal processing recycling ie depollution thus enormous value 3 raw material scarcity addition also becoming economically ever important recover many element outdated electronics possible metal cobalt cadmium example primarily found mine congo zambia extracted dubious circumstance without concern environmental impact metal gold silver copper also increasingly difficult extract yet found easily accessible many electronic device scarcity felt even strongly 2016 increased importance electrorecycling 4 invisible kilo according recent figure every belgian generates 224 kg electrical electronic waste annual basis meantime almost half around 10 kg properly collected recupel network reuse recycling 102 kg thus guaranteed end somewhere africa asia testaankoop describes people attempt rudimentary way collect valuable electronic component attendant consequence health environment thus important better map still invisible kilo order able guarantee properly collected recycled well brief reason enough recupel shift higher gear 2016 collect electrical electronic equipment ever combining expansion collection network recupel targeted campaign lamp small electrical appliance taught right habit significant group belgian say sabbe dont throw electrical electronic waste away bring u 2016 urban mining longer option become necessity 2 awareness raising 2016 belgian became aware ever importance urban mining thing like action raise awareness student new website two largescale medium campaign increase number store become collection point active pr component recupel 2016 able make belgian aware ever increasing importance proper collection reprocessing electrical electronic waste begin 2016 work done positioning recupel area public relation public affair intention leveraging name recognition highlighting organisation social importance accomplish recupel joined force many organisation institution shown interest associated recycling urban mining circular economy proper understanding ewaste problematic activity recupel many stakeholder possible great importance guaranteeing positive evolution recupels activity concrete result increased attention medium relation already sharp increase number newspaper article radio interview tv report devoting attention recupels important role electrorecycling belgium café recupel order specifically raise awareness belgian student population 2016 recupel opened café recupel action student get chance bring electrical electronic waste easily accessible way collaborated intensively recycling shop intermunicipal utility company mentioned communication event present site order check device brought reuse potential thus 2016 six cafés organised distributed across country three region apart collection old electrical electronic equipment initiative also generated good deal medium attention recupels new website addition recupels new website launched 2016 elaborated basic platform recupels
