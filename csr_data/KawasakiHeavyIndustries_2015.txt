petroleum as fuel to power automobiles and like natural gas to generate electricity but

unlike fossil fuels hydrogen does not emit carbon dioxide when combusted to produce

energy


hydrogen it can be produced from various substances using fossil fuels or green energy

and it can be transported and stored the infrastructure needed to utilize hydrogen as a

viable energy source is being established worldwide


hydrogenproduction transportation  storage and utilization

our technologies are highly compatible with each of these processes these technologies

will link hydrogen production sites to energy consumers and in doing so forge a new way

called hydrogen road
