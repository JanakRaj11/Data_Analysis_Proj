zinc with its key attributes of essentiality durability and
recyclability is well positioned as a material of choice for a
sustainable society

origin
zinc a metallic chemical element is the 23rd most abundant element in the earths crust
alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called philosophers wool the element was
probably named by the alchemist paracelsus after the german word zinke around 1800 luigi
galvani and alessandro volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc
ore and manufacturing
the most commonly found zinc mineral is sphalerite zns also known as zinc blende which is
found in almost all currently mined zinc deposits zinc concentration is usually done at the mine
site before sending the concentrate to the processing plant concentration is achieved using
crushing and grinding followed by froth flotation method zinc is manufactured by reducing the
concentrated zinc using pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical methods
properties and applications
zinc has the third highest usage of nonferrous metal behind aluminum and copper owing to its
resistance to nonacidic atmospheric corrosion it is used to galvanise steel thus is instrumental in
extending the life of steel goods and structures of every kind due to a relatively low melting point
it is used in the production of a number of alloys such as brass the metal also finds applications in
the pharmaceutical nutrient construction battery and chemical industries
zinc is a valuable commodity because of excellent recyclability characteristics it can store six times
as much energy per pound as any other battery system increasing the range of electric vehicles
zinc is far friendlier to the environment as compared to other metals the energy required to
produce zinc from ore is onefourth of that needed to produce aluminum and half that of copper
and steel zinc is a nonpoisonous and an environmentally sound product
the major zincproducing nations are
canada and china in india the major
end uses of zinc are in galvanising dry                     chemicals 6   misc 4

                                              rolled zinc 6

zinc in india was 501 kiloton in 2011
which represented about 4 of
global demand and is expected to                             diecasting 17
increase substantially in the medium
term the zinc demand in india is
expected to grow at a compounded

that everything we do is sustainable

sustainability impacts risks and opportunities
the close financial and trade ties forged among economies by the
globalisation process over the preceding decades enabled the financial crisis
which began in late 2008 to spread almost instantaneously to practically every
country of the world this triggered the deepest and broadest recession since
the 1930s and ended the growth cycle that had lasted from 2003 to the first
half of 2008

india has seen relatively slow growth since second half of 2008 in a cautious
economy the demand for zinc in india is estimated at approximately 600 kt
and is growing at around 8 cagr the average zinc price in the london
metal exchange lme was approximately 2185  tonne during 201011

the major challenges we face include raw material availability fluctuation in
zinc  energy prices and enhanced metal supply in market we have drawn a
comprehensive plan to mitigate the perceived threats

we have attained sufficient expertise in hedging to safeguard ourselves from
wide fluctuations in zinc price and have a good spread of sales depots in the
country that ensures a good market for our product our product quality and
brand equity are well accepted in the market our focus on value addition has
brought improved margins and new customers

we have long term contracts with suppliers of raw material which secures
around 75 of our requirement of zinc concentrate in the coming year
investments in mines through our subsidiaries rbg minerals industries ltd
and bz minerals australia pty ltd will help ensure continuous and
sustainable availability of raw material in the long run

four decades of the environmental revolution has changed how
companies do business till 1970s corporates were in denial stage
regarding their environmental impacts then a series of highly visible
ecological problems  accidents created ground for strict regulations
and global treaties but as we stepped into the 21st century the stress
on natural resources water shortage soil exhaustion loss of forests air 
water pollution and degradation of coastlines forced organisations to
look beyond regulatory compliance and move towards sustainable
development

we understand that the various business operations are dependent
upon natural ecosystem and therefore makes it inevitable the
constrained on the environment hence we take cognizance of our
responsibility and imbibe sustainable development philosophy in our
business operations and planning as a part of our commitment to
environmental management we have implemented iso 14001 in our
unit we have been adhering to this environment management system
for improving the environmental performance under iso 14001
significant environmental aspects and impacts are identified and
comprehensive environmental management plans are developed to
minimise the impact for other environmental impacts operational
control procedures are developed to be able to minimise the same
during our daily operations

monitoring of air pollutants solid waste and wastewater discharges is
carried out and authorities are provided with annual reports detailing
our environmental performance relevant training is imparted to
employees in the area of environmental management for enabling
them to help the organisation imbibe sustainability in its dna

this section of the report aims to provide an overview of our
environmental performance and our approach to address significant
environmental issues as we operate our business

       roasting

            the concentrate zinc sulphide is roasted in a fluidised bed roaster
            and converted to calacine zinc oxide the flue sulphur dioxide is
            used to manufacture sulphuric acid h2so4 in dcda acid plant




       leaching

            the calcine is leached with spent electrolyte to get zinc sulphate
            solution and subjected to two stages of purification using
            appropriate purification technology licensed from um engineering
            belgium the process ensures removal of all traces of impurities and
            pure zinc sulphate electrolyte is produced cadmium metal is
            recovered as a byproduct from the purification residue




       purification

            in this process the impurities like copper cadmium cobalt and nickel
            are extracted from the impure zinc sulphate solution copper
            cadmium cobalt and nickel are purified and the solution is filtered
            pure zinc sulphate electrolyte is then sent for electrolysis




       electrolysis

                 the purified zinc sulphate solution is electrolysed in an
                 automated jumbo cell house the zinc thus produced is
                 deposited on aluminium cathodes which are stripped in a
                 cycle of 48 hours




       melting

                 the stripped cathode zinc sheets are melted in an induction
                 furnace and cast into saleable ingots

union relations
we share good industrial relations with our workforce all operational changes affecting workers are
discussed well in advance with the workforce and notice period is decided based on statutory requirements
as well as consultations with the unions

we respect workers right to collective bargaining all permanent workmen are unionised and elect union
representatives they are organised into three unions viz cominco binani zinc employees union cominco
binani zinc employees association and cominco binani zinc employees organisation all the three union
representatives were elected as the nonmanagement representative these representatives meet every
month to sort out workplace grievances welfare measures health and safety facilities etc we do not restrict
any company personnel from joining or forming a trade union all terms and conditions negotiated by the
unions on behalf of the workmen are incorporated in the long term agreement the purpose of this
agreement is to provide orderly collective bargaining relations to secure prompt and fair disposal of
grievances foster fair work practices discourage unfair labour practices to establish fair work standards
fair wages and other working conditions to improve efficiencies to maintain harmonious relationship
between all employees and the workmen and the company to attain efficient and uninterrupted
operations of the plant to prevent strikes lockouts slowdown etc to promote stability and prosperity of
the company however industrial relations in the organisation are very good and workers seldom approach
the representatives as most of their concerns  grievances are resolved at sectionlevel workers have access
to senior staff and management members all workers are aware of our grievance redressal procedure
which forms a part of the long term agreement as per the procedure the affected employee can escalate
his  her grievance from the immediate supervisorylevel to the president

our product
stewardship




70 binani zinc limited

zinc is a sustainable material with a wide variety
of end uses the most prominent being
galvanising to protect steel from corrosion main
application areas for zinc products are
construction transport consumer goods 
electrical appliances and general engineering

the environmental footprint of zinc starts with
documenting the resource requirements and
environmental releases associated with upstream
metal production operations but it also involves
understanding the impacts and the benefits of
using zinc during other stages in the product life
cycle these benefits can arise in use eg
extending the life of steel products and through
endoflife recycling eg by utilising recycled zinc
to create new products zinc occurs naturally
therefore eliminating it from the environment is
neither possible nor desirable there are no
negative health and safety impacts of zinc ingots
during the use phase

we have internally conducted a brief life cycle
assessment of our product the study showed
that the carbon footprint of the product is
approximately 3 tonnes of co2 equivalent per
tonne of zinc produced the system boundary
selected for the study is presented below
