 three basic procurement principles

     create an ethical clear and open corporate culture and establish ourselves as a company that can be

      trusted by society
     promote socially responsible procurement activities throughout the supply chain including not only

      the yokogawa group but also the suppliers of yokogawa
     comprehensively evaluate and select suppliers giving priority to our commitment to being a good

      corporate citizen

 initiatives on conflict minerals

  certain minerals tin tantalum tungsten and gold produced in the democratic republic of the congo and
  nearby nations and distributed via supply chains might be used to fund armed forces engaged in illicit
  activities involving humanrights violations acts of violence etc and consequently such materials are
  referred to as conflict minerals
  recognizing that cutting off these armed forces money source is a challenge that the whole supply chain
  should tackle the yokogawa group aims to become conflictfree by using no conflict minerals for our
  products however not all the minerals are prohibited from procurement even if they are produced from
  the above countries we will continue procuring the minerals that are considered to have been traded after
  refined by the refinery recognized as unrelated to such armed forces by the independent organization and
  the proper products derived from such minerals
  to meet the aforementioned challenge the yokogawa group has carried out the following efforts
     dedicated structures were put in place in the relevant departments in 2011 through which we took

      appropriate action
     as a member of the responsible minerals trade working group run by the jeita japan electronics

      and information technology industries association we coordinate our efforts with those of other
      corporations and obtain the latest information

      confirmed as conflictfree

term usability energysaving performance and other aspects new products are
evaluated for energy consumption as well as the emission of carbon dioxide
co2 nitrogen oxide nox and sulfur oxide sox based on our lifecycle
assessment lca standards


  guidelines for environmentally friendly design

1 environmental assessment standards for product design
  we have established assessment standards in eight areas ease of recycling and treatment resource
  conservation energy conservation longterm usability ease of collection and transport safety and
  environmental protectiveness information disclosure and packaging these standards are used in
  conducting assessments during each inspection initial design intermediate design and final design


2 lifecycle assessment lca standards
  the lca standards are used for preliminary assessments of energy use co2 emissions nox emissions
  sox emissions and the like throughout the lifecycle of a product these standards are used in conducting
  assessments during each inspection initial design intermediary design and final design


3 environmentally friendly product design guidelines
  these guidelines establish design and machining and assembly methods that incorporate longlife design
  energy conservation design resource conservation design and materials and parts selection guidelines as
  well as standards for the recycling and disposal of products


4 criteria for hazardous substances contained in products
  the following criteria are provided to ensure that environmentally friendly parts and materials are selected
  during the design phase controlled substances are classified into five different levels


  banned substance 1       any substance that is banned from inclusion in a product
  banned substance 2       any rohs command regulated substance
  controlled substance 1   any svhc substance of very high concern under the reach regulation

  					                     purposes of use or restricted in any way
  controlled substance 3   any substance for which the amount contained in a product must be identified


5 recycled product design standards
  these standards encourage the three rs the reduction of waste and the reuse and recycling of used
  products


6 energysaving design guidelines
  these guidelines state that energy is to be conserved in the manufacturing and product use stages they
  introduce energy conservation design technologies for products and manufacturing

 yokogawa began to conduct the life cycle assessment lca in 1999 in the
 design phase of all new products as part of efforts to minimize our products
 environmental impact some of the results of the lca are disclosed on our
 website when lca data is disclosed for a product the applicable product is
 lcalabeled in the product webpage andor sales brochure


 requirements for lca labeling

 a product will be lcalabeled if it meets all the requirements described below


    1   life cycle assessment has been conducted according to yokogawas engineering specifications
    2   the results of life cycle assessment are disclosed on the yokogawa website according to the
         companys internal rules


 conceptimplementation of the lca

 yokogawa has set its unique lca standards based on jis q 14040 environmental management  life
 cycle assessment  principles and framework we compare a new product with its previous product for
 assessment purposes the results of the lca of the previous product are multiplied by the functional
 factor to compare the environmental impacts based on the equivalent functionality of the new product
 when the results of the lca on the previous products clearly suggest how these products would impact the
 environment we may only conduct lca on the elements significantly affecting the environmental impact

     global warming prevention

the yokogawa group green promotion committee was formed to step up our efforts to preserve the global
environment and enhance our programs to counter global warming we have set co2 emission reduction
targets for the yokogawa group japan for the phases 20102014 20152019 and 2020 and are implementing
emission reduction programs to achieve those targets our ongoing co2 emission reduction programs include
the improvement of production lines the introduction of highefficiency heatingcooling equipment the
installation of inverterdriven lights led lights and the use of green power
for our offices and factories we have employed infoenergy yokogawas proprietary energy conservation
support system designed to visualize energy data in order to reduce co2 emissions
moreover in order to optimize global distribution we are making efforts to improve transportation efficiency
by changing the design of container boxes to reduce the weight downsizing them and revising transportation
methods and routes for product shipment
yokogawa electric and yokogawa manufacturing participate in the keidanrens commitment to a lowcarbon
society an industry action policy established subsequent to the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol
specifically the companies are working on improving their production processes in order to realize greater
energy efficiency in production processes such efficiency being a common goal of the electrical and electronics
industry our target is to improve the average annual energy consumption rate by 1 by 2020


  co2 emission reduction targets and performance for yokogawa group japan

  the yokogawa group japan has set its co2 emission reduction targets toward 2020 and is directing its
  efforts to achieve the targets by using the annual average of emissions measured over the 2005 to 2007
  period as the baseline 56560 tons of co2 we have set different reduction targets for three phases with the
  ultimate objective of achieving the goal set for 2020 specifically we are implementing a range of activities
  to achieve the reduction targets described below


      2010 to 2014 period a 7 reduction in total emissions
       263005 tons of co2 with an annual average of 52601 tons of co2
      2015 to 2019 period an 18 reduction in total emissions
       231895 tons of co2 with an annual average of 46379 tons of co2
      2020 20 reduction
       45248 tons of co2


  the yokogawa group japan produced 37224tco2 of carbon dioxide emissions in 2015 achieving its co2
  emission reduction target performance of the average reduction rate of co2 in the second phase was 34
  to 18 of the goal the target level was achieved as the evaluation of a single year overseas each of our
  group companies overseas sets its voluntary reduction target and is working to achieve the target

 reduction of energy consumption due to change in nitrogen supply system

 yokogawa electric komagane factory

 energy consumptions have reduced significantly by revising the manufacturing method for compressed
 nitrogen used on semiconductor manufacturing lines in the komagane office
 on the semiconductor manufacturing lines compressed nitrogen with different purity is used according
 to the application conventionally the komagane office had used the compressed nitrogen which always
 had high purity generated from the liquefied nitrogen purchased from its contractor now the komagane
 office has introduced new compressed nitrogen manufacturing equipment with a psa system that supplies
 nitrogen after separating it from air and has changed some compressed nitrogen with high purity to that
 with low purity by the psa system as a result of the reduced usage of such liquefied nitrogen energy
 consumptions to manufacture liquefied nitrogen at the contractor have reduced from about 1 to 2 kwhm3
 to about 1 kwhm3 in the whole life cycle up to 135 mwh of them have reduced

 eliminating the leakage risk of chemical substances by changing the structure of
 wastewater storage tank

 yokogawa electric komagane factory

 in the komagane office the risk of wastewater leakage has been eliminated by applying a special structure
 to the inner wall of the underground raw water tank that stores wastewater from the semiconductor
 manufacturing lines
 conventionally the komagane office had checked for leakage by periodically inspecting the water level
 of the raw water tank in order to prevent the leakage accident of wastewater due to its deteriorated inner
 wall they applied the frp lining 1 with honeycomb structure to the inner wall and also introduced the
 system to always check for leakage from the inner layer this has eliminated the risk that chemical substances
 contained in wastewater may leak to the outside
