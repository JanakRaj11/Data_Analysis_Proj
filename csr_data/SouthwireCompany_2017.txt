                                               lead the way to our future success

                                               looking back to 2016 id like to highlight a few areas of signi cant progress

safety
as i always say to our employees there is nothing more important at southwireno order no job no e ciencythan the people who work
here throughout the year we did a great job of putting new policies teams and systems in place to identify hazards and mitigate risk
throughout the organization and our efforts havent stopped we continue to nd new ways to eliminate injuries and incidents from our
workplace and strive each day for best in class safety performance

strategy
another key highlight of the year was the introduction of our one southwire approach meaning that we act as a uni ed company sharing
our values culture commitment and processes in order to provide the best solutions for our stakeholders as the year progressed we
restructured our business groups to better serve our markets began the creation of standardized tool kits looked at continued career
development opportunities and made many other advancements in the spirit of our three strategic initiatives build organizational
capability drive operational excellence and accelerate growth

growth through investment
though we faced economic challenges in a few of our markets we were able to make signi cant investments through the acquisitions of
united copper industries inc and sumner manufacturing inc in 2016 helping us to take advantage of opportunities in one of our core
business areas and further expand the footprint of one of our newer businesses we expanded the product offering in many of our
business units and continue to innovate and create gamechanging solutions to better serve the needs of our customers we also
expanded our distribution footprint with the creation of the retail east csc which serves the needs of retail customers like the home
depot lowes and menards

inspiration through our communities
as we remain steadfast in our commitment to giving back we celebrated signi cant wins with our educational partnerships and our now
more than 800 project gift blackshirt volunteers participated in over 100 events last year these achievements were highlighted by the
milestone of now more than 1600 12 for life graduates and our efforts to distribute in excess of 23000 bags in our back to school

giveaways across the southwire footprint

as weve taken meaningful steps to develop and implement our goals for the future our accomplishments have only been possible
through the relentless efforts of our southwire people i am extremely proud to lead this great team as we prepare for the next generation
of industryleading success

sincerely

environmental priorities detailed in this report


 energy usage

 waste



in 2016 southwire developed ve new goals to enhance our sustainability performance our growing green goal and metrics include




2021 sustainability goals  targets

achieve top decile djsi dow jones sustainability index performance in
operational ecoe ciency in the electrical components  equipment sector
   reduce energy and greenhouse gas ghg emissions intensity by 15 through conservation and the use
   of renewable energy by 2021
   achieve zero operational waste to land ll status at all locations by yearend 2017 and maintain status with growth through 2021
   further reduce water intensity by 10 over 2016 baseline by 2021



djsi is considered the gold standard for corporate sustainability performance an emphasis on operational ecoe ciency directly
translates into low operating costs and sound environmental protection practices achieving top decile performance within the electrical
components  equipment sector will demonstrate southwires commitment to be a leader in protecting our environment

we will begin reporting our progress against these goals in our 2017 sustainability report

                  growing green

                  energy usage
   reducing energy intensity and increasing use of alternative and renewable sources


why managing it matters

as energy prices become increasingly volatileand climate change more of a concernreducing our
energy usage makes good business sense for the longterm health of our business and our
communities responsible stewardship of our energy footprint remains a high priority for our
shareholders and other stakeholders


g4dma 


our approach
southwires commitment to environmental stewardship includes a focus on both energy reduction and the use of alternative sources
where feasible being responsible energy consumers matters to us and to our customers we regularly receive customer inquiries about
our energy usage reduction goals and e ciency improvement initiatives we manage our energy footprint with audits goals governance
mechanisms policies partnerships internal benchmarking specialized teams accountability and communication

energy audits
we completed energy audits at two southwire facilities in 2016 and we will conduct assessments at an additional ve to seven facilities
in 2017 from these audits we intend to build a database of potential energysavings opportunities that can be deployed throughout the
organization though still in the evaluation phase one project identi ed in 2016 appears to have the potential to provide signi cant energy
and cost savings at a number of locations in addition as we upgrade or modify equipment we seek to utilize the most energye cient
technology when possible

goal setting
in 2010 we set a 2020 goal to achieve a 10 percent improvement in our energy e ciency over our baseline this goal pushed our
employees to look for ways to reduce energy usage and we achieved our target in 2012 despite minor setbacks due to supply chain
adjustments and changes in product mix southwire set an aggressive new goal in 2016 with a corresponding new energy and
greenhouse gas ghg emissions reduction target we will begin reporting our progress toward our new goals in our 2017 sustainability
report




2021 sustainability goals  targets

achieve top decile djsi dow jones sustainability index performance in
operational ecoe ciency in the electrical components  equipment sector
   reduce energy and greenhouse gas ghg emissions intensity by 15 through conservation and the use
   of renewable energy by 2021

our new energy and ghg reduction targets will build upon the growing green efforts we started in 2007 in particular the new ghg
objective moves the company toward a visible and meaningful commitment to addressing climate change

governance
management of our energy use begins with our individual plants and our ehs department manages our energy performance data these
units report to our divisional leadership who in turn report to our executive vice president of international and operational development

policies
southwire rst issued its ehs policies and principles document in 1994 since then we updated the document as needed in recognition
that new issues arise over time in this document we state our commitment to maximize the energy e ciency of our existing operations
and save energy to the greatest feasible extent

partnerships and internal benchmarking
we are working to further improve our energy management by engaging with an outside rm to help identify additional energysaving
opportunities across our top energyconsuming facilities presently each manufacturing plant manages its energy consumption on an
individual basis making it di cult to achieve a standardized approach and quantify the impact of each facilitys separate actions

with our planned approach we will review consumption versus production and complete energy audits at select locations to identify
potential savings opportunities for energy use spend and ghg emissions further we plan to replicate an internal benchmarking
approach we used with water usage to identify best practices and encourage plants with relatively higher energy footprints to identify
opportunities to reduce energy usage as well

energy reduction team
in the fall of 2015 our top operations leaders met to draw up a veyear strategic plan to increase capacity and productivity and reduce
costs energy and scrap from this summit sprang an energy reduction team consisting of our environmental director engineering director
and three plant managers in 2016 this team evaluated several energy consulting rms including three pilot projects to identify a
potential partner to aid in our energy assessments over time this group aims to improve energy e ciency through a combination of
capital investment and updated operational practices

accountability and communication
our board receives a quarterly update on energy usage divisional plant and environmental staff receive summarized companywide and
individual plant energy performance data on a periodic basis we also keep employees up to date by posting monthly infographics on our

                  growing green

                  waste
   reducing the amount of waste to land ll and increasing responsible waste


why managing it matters

diverting waste from land lls is a foundational piece of our environmental stewardship commitment
driving us toward more e cient and responsible production and minimizing our footprint in our
communities and around the globe


g4dma 


our approach
our growing green strategy to reduce our environmental footprint even as we grow remains as important to the collective fabric of our
company as it was when we began our journey toward a more sustainable future our management approach utilizes goals governance
mechanisms and partnerships

goal setting
southwires environmental practices include proactively managing operational waste in 2007 we set an aggressive goal to send zero
waste to land ll by the end of 2017 to achieve this goal we actively identify our different waste streams segregating valuable recyclable
materials and making simple changes where possible

southwire revised the goal in 2016 to re ect our intention to maintain zero land ll at existing locations and work to attain zero land ll at
new locations and facilities acquired in 2016 and beyond we will begin reporting our progress toward our new goals in our 2017
sustainability report




2021 sustainability goals  targets

achieve top decile djsi dow jones sustainability index performance in
operational ecoe ciency in the electrical components  equipment sector
   achieve zero operational waste to land ll status at all locations by yearend 2017 and maintain status
   with growth through 2021



waste minimization teams
our environmental team manages all data related to our waste streams while our plants and division leaders are responsible for
developing new strategies to minimize waste plants use teams such as a growing green team a zero land ll team environmental team
or an ops team to actively look for opportunities to reduce waste at their facilities

partnerships

southwires national waste management partner helps us to better assess risks associated with waste management and suggests
alternate routes for waste streams this arrangement helps us operate more e ciently rather than each plant managing the cost of
waste we now run our costs through a central data system finally our partner helps us more accurately track monthly waste generation
at our southwire operating facilities they provide data and progress updates for all our sites as well as weekly feedback on any speci c
issues that arise

within our extended value chain we evaluate packaging entering our facilities and work with suppliers to minimize those materials
among our own products we reduce packaging and other waste material as well for example our simpull solutions require zero
spools rags or added lubricant eliminating waste at customer job sites additionally we have instituted takeback programs that give
credit for returned material

                  living well

                  workplace safety  health
   providing a safe working environment for our employees and contractors through the elimination of hazards
   and the implementation of safety training systems and equipment


why managing it matters

effectively managing workplace safety and health risks and encouraging employees to take
responsibility for their safetyand that of their coworkersimproves working conditions which in turn
protects our employees quality of life our employees help differentiate southwire from the
competition by ensuring we consistently deliver the best quality product to our customers in a timely
manner when our employees are safe healthy and engaged southwire performs best


g4dma 


our approach
southwire manages safety as a matter of principlethe wellbeing of employees and contractors matters most workplace safety and
health remain southwires primary concern for all our employees and contractors in 2016 we established a goal to achieve best in class
safety performance at southwire we use a wide range of initiatives governance mechanisms policies systems and training to
continually improve our safety and health performance always with the goal of zero injuries in mind

southwire continuum to best in class
safety is core to southwires culture to plot our path to excellence we established the southwire continuum to best in class to help our
leaders move the organization along the path of safety culture and performance  from reactive to proactive then to systemsbased and
to the ultimate goal of being world class recognizing that each southwire location may nd itself at a different place on the continuum
this strategy offers a meet them where they are approach to safety planning and execution the continuum will play a key role in future
environmental health and safety ehs planning processes serving as a tool for identifying where locations need the most support and
guidance the following areas are outlined in the continuum

  leadership commitment
  responsibility and accountability
  organization and structure
  communication and training
  incident management
  hazard identi cation and controls
  work practices and behavior and
  measurement and monitoring

clearly describing excellence and accountability in each of these areas will enable leaders across the organization to continue to enhance
safety performance

another tool we are using to drive performance is franklincoveys 4 disciplines of execution 4dxfocus leverage engagement and
accountability 4dx provides locations that are experiencing the most injuries with a proven methodology to place a heightened focus on
the critical activities and behaviors that are needed to reduce their injuries each facility will have its own performance targets and lead
measures based on injury history and risk in areas such as ergonomics machine guarding employee engagement and near miss
reporting sites may also use the continuum as a guide to build a safety culture and establish systems our goal is zero injuries period

goals
to continue to improve our safety performance southwire set three aggressive longterm goals covering both employees and
contractors

  certi cation of safety management systems implement one of the following certi ed safety management systems at all
  manufacturing and warehouse locations by yearend 2022 osha voluntary protection program vpp occupational health safety
  assessment speci cation ohsas 18001 soon to become iso 45001 or an incountry equivalent
  employee safety achieve an osha total recordable injury rate for global operations of less than 10 by yearend 2018
  contractor safety achieve 20 percent reduction in contractor injury rates by yearend 2018

in 2016 we refreshed our workplace safety goal and developed three new targets for the next ve years we will begin reporting our
progress in our 2017 sustainability report




2021 sustainability goals  targets

achieve best in class safety performance at southwire
   achieve 10x increase in injuryfree event reporting by 2021
   achieve 75 decrease in the total recordable injury rate by 2021
   achieve occupational safety and health administration osha voluntary protection program vpp or equivalent certi cation at all
   sites by 2021



governance
re ecting our emphasis on governance we hold leaders to the highest level of accountability for workplace safety and health
responsibility starts with the sustainability committee of our board and our chief executive o cer and cascades down to southwires
executive leadership team additionally operations leadership and location managers participate in weekly web conferences to report
their performance on workplace safety and health metrics review safety incidents and present best practices our operations ehs
steering committee convenes regularly to set strategies and review progress on implemented action plans at all southwire facilities with
the support and guidance of our safety teams

health  safety committees
among our various manufacturing plants and distribution facilities our employees actively participate on health and safety committees
and teams including emergency preparedness ergonomics job safety analysis hazard recognition incident investigation sustainability
environmental behavior based safety lockouttagout machine guarding rst responders and steering committees

we implemented our new key performance indicator that measures the percentage of ehs involvement for all our manufacturing and
warehouse operations this measure captures the total percentage of the workforce engaged in safety health and environmental
committees teams or other hazard identi cation and mitigation strategies establishing this new indicator allowed us to set a target of 80
percent participation for 2016 after developing a standardized approach to gathering that data we anticipate reporting on our progress
in the 2017 sustainability report monitoring participation rates enables us to better identify and manage opportunities for improvement

training
in late 2016 we kicked off a strategic learning focus on increasing organizational capability in human performance error management
techniques a team of plant health and safety professionals created a southwirespeci c training curriculum and initiated a pilot program
at our building wire plant in carrollton georgia this training for plant managers and supervisors focused on learning to recognize error
likely situations which increase the risk of safety incidents and quality errors the team will also provide coaching for supervisors and
managers on how to mitigate these situations when error precursors are identi ed

policies  compliance
a vast network of policies starting with our ehs policy guides our operational safety in 2015 southwire began integrating our ehs
policies with our corporate management systems in 2016 we developed more than 50 standardized ehs policies and program templates
and created a set of minimum expectations for the locations to meet regulatory requirements and southwire standards in 2017 we will
roll out a portion of these standards to sites each quarter with the objective to have all standards implemented at all warehouse and

manufacturing locations by the end of the year in 2018 we will begin auditing sites against these standards and scoring them on their
performance this more comprehensive standardized system will support the companys one southwire philosophy eliminate variability
and facilitate integration of new facilities and acquisitions

certi cation of safety management systems
safety management systems provide southwire with a foundation to achieve and sustain success in workplace safety and health
southwire committed to implementing and certifying a safety management system at each of our locations by 2021 currently close to
40 percent of southwire sites meet this goal

within our us operations southwire is working to certify all manufacturing and warehouse operations within the osha voluntary
protection program vpp which consists of management commitment employee involvement hazard prevention and control and safety
training operations outside the united states or those that primarily serve international customers will certify against the occupational
health and safety assessment speci cation ohsas 18001 soon to be iso 45001 or an incountry equivalent standard such as our
tecate mexico facility which is certi ed under mexicos secretaría del trabajo y previsión social empresa segura program

contractor safety initiatives
southwire holds onsite contractors to the same standards as employees and evaluates their safety performance before they arrive using
our prequali cation program to prequalify contractors must achieve a grade of either a or b for the following requirements

  experience modi er
  written safety program
  safety questionnaire
  evaluation reports
  drug and alcohol screening and background checks
  training documentation

southwire tailors these requirements to the contractors type of work after prequali cation we host contractor safety orientations to
help them learn our internal environmental health and safety requirements we also use an electronic reporting system for contractor
incident investigations and inspections


our performance
we believe in the adage you cant manage what you dont measure therefore we track a wide variety of performance metrics related to
workplace safety and health we use leading indicator data to enable a proactive assessment of our safety performance one focus area
in our leading indicator reporting was near misses we also track but do not publicly report osha citationsviolations

osha total recordable injury rate trir




osha lost work day rate lwdr

number of incidents 200000hours worked



vpp sites or equivalent




the percentage and number of certi ed sites has varied over the last several years as southwire has closed existing facilities some of which were certi ed started up
green eld sites and grown through acquisition as an example southwires 2014 acquisition of coleman cable increased the total number of sites resulting in a signi cant
decrease in the percentage of vpp or equivalent certi ed sites


g4la7 


southwire tracks occupational illnesses in our ehs data management system our corporate ehs department monitors this data and we
have found no discernable trend in occupational illness should any trend in occupational illness arise we will manage it through our
existing risk mitigation processes

g4la8 


southwire operates two unionrepresented facilities and section 17 of the collective bargaining agreement covers safety and health the
provisions of the agreement stipulate that the company will make reasonable provisions for the safety and health of our employees an
employee from each shift will be trained in rst aid response the company will furnish all safety personal protective equipment required
by state and federal law and southwire will provide employees with a safety shoe allowance further the contract stipulates that
southwire management will meet with the union safety committee on a monthly basis and correct any safety violations in addition the
agreement outlines that southwire and the union mutually support participation in osha vpp and actively participate in all safety
programs connected to vpp implementation

to attract and retain employees and develop leaders to continue our prominent role in the market we
must leverage technology give employees experiences they would not receive elsewhere and help
employees connect to our culture


our approach
talent acquisition
southwires current recruiting process seeks to strengthen our talent acquisition and track the status of recruits through weekly reporting
these formal programs provide a consistent recruiting platform throughout southwire we now process professional openings in a
consistent structured manner supported by a recruiting and applicant tracking system that follows applications and key metrics such as

  time to hire
  candidate diversity
  total cost of recruitment for open positions
  external offers accepted versus rejected
  the number of positions lled internally versus externally

we also track turnover rates and conduct exit interviews to determine the reasons employees leave and the consequent cost of employee
turnover for the organization

leveraging technology for professional recruiting became a key objective in 2015 in 2016 southwire implemented its human capital
management system which includes recruiting and applicant tracking software in the future social media recruitment and branding
campaigns will become recruiting platforms for attracting candidates to southwire

southwire continued to enhance our college recruiting and college relations programs in 2016 southwire professional sta ng continued
its participation in the georgia association of college and employers gace additionally collegerecruiting activities continued at
georgia tech kennesaw state university north carolina at state university auburn university purdue university university of west
georgia mercer university mississippi state university university of georgia indiana university of pennsylvania clemson university
georgia state university university of alabama and the university of mississippi

southwire enhanced and continued to grow the engineering coop program which has been implemented in the construction systems 
solutions group and corporate logistics group the program expanded from six coop students to 25 our corporate accounting and
finance department continued the finance rotational program to recruit entrylevel graduating students in 2016 our human resources
department launched a rotational program to build its pool of potential human resources managers

partnerships previously developed with georgia techs o ce of minority educational development omed auburn universitys 100
women strong north carolina at state universitys engineering school and the university of west georgia where we sponsor the
southwire sustainable business honors program continue to strengthen southwires branding and community relations in a mutually
bene cial manner for example some southwire sustainable business honors program students intern at southwire providing us with an
emerging talent pipeline


our other educational recruitment programs include the southwire engineering academy and the 12 for life program southwire actively
works with students in these programs to increase their familiarity with a variety of working environments while affording southwire
opportunities to train and develop a potential source of future leaders and technical ability ready for immediate professional assignments
with limited onthejob training after graduation to learn more about these two programs visit our communities page

talent development
as part of our overall talent management programs we enhanced our talent acquisition management and development through our new
human capital management partnership with sap successfactors

performance acceleration
as baby boomers leave the workforce both generation x and millennials will need to take leadership positionsmillennials at a younger
age than previous generations of leaders in the past leaders spent time learning on the job in the future employees will need to learn
more quickly before taking leadership roles

external research indicates that engaging in coaching conversations and developing corrective actions are more effective than ratings
systems building from our previous implementation of performance acceleration a framework for informal and formal feedback
between managers and employees we continued to train managers in this way additionally we are now tracking objectives and
performance coaching conversations in successfactors

the coaching guide acts as a catalyst to the performance acceleration process by helping employees better understand their personal
strengths and gaps to close the process focuses on the essences of southwireleadership skills and attributes unique to the southwire
cultureand articulates the speci c implications these leadership traits have for fostering our culture and driving high performance we
also developed a performance guide for managers that illuminates how certain behaviors competencies and creating a line of sight for
employees to connect to southwires vision and strategy contribute to our companys success as part of the rollout southwire completed
training across the organization

executive leadership assessments
in 2014 we administered executive leadership assessments that included personalized growth plans to onethird of the executive
leadership team in 2015 we assessed an additional third of the executive leadership team but we put this program on hold in 2015 while
we launched our performance acceleration program in 2016 we resumed our executive leadership assessments and will complete them
in 2017

southwire leadership academy
our leadership academy augments and develops leadership traits enhances succession management planning and grooms individuals
through a production management approach southwire aspires to graduate 150 senior leaders by the end of 2018 to date the program
has 96 graduates

emotional intelligence
the body of work surrounding emotional intelligence suggests that it accounts for approximately twothirds of a persons success in a
leadership role to assess and build the emotional intelligence of southwires future leaders our leadership academy includes
rochemartins emotional capital assessment to build these key competencies the weeklong academy includes group exercises to build
participants awareness and acceptance after the event southwire provides oneonone coaching to participants to help them learn their
emotional intelligence strengths and opportunities for development as they grow in their leadership competencies

alumni experience
taking place approximately six months after the weeklong southwire leadership academy the alumni experience is designed to
immerse southwires future leaders in a day in the life of the ceo using real examples of a ceos life and the challenges of running a
business with competing and sometimes con icting priorities attendees gain an understanding of what it means to lead an organization
with the size and complexity of southwire the program emphasizes southwires distinguishing characteristics as an organization driving
for results creating a caring culture and investing in the communities in which it operates the alumni experience encapsulates building
these traits as fundamental to the success of the organizations leadership

training
southwire offers a series of professional skills development courses through our webbased learning management system lms this
system enables us to better track trend and analyze utilization in 2016 the lms was upgraded as part of our implementation of
successfactors

to train hourly employees for new opportunities we analyzed various positions created a list of required competencies and matched
employees based on their skill set and role

our approach
southwires approach to employee engagement intertwines with talent development by offering unique professional development
opportunities employees enhance their skills increase their comfort taking risks and heighten levels of engagement in this section we
explain southwires approach to monitoring managing and responding to engagement scores for more on how we encourage
engagement through development read about our talent acquisition and development

engagement survey
to identify areas of strength and opportunities to improve engagement southwire partners with a third party to conduct an employee
engagement survey every 18 months we provide this anonymous online survey to all fulltime southwire employees based on the
results of this assessment the companys leaders create goals and plans to sustain success in areas of high achievement and to develop
stronger engagement in those categories which have been identi ed for improvement read more about how we respond to the results of
our employee engagement surveys in our highlight story

southwires goal is an employee engagement score of 75 percent favorable or higher which indicates high employee engagement
according to survey creator pwc we also carefully monitor the number of voluntary survey responses we receive to offer insight into the
robustness of our engagement our target participation rate is 90 percent see our performance below for our scores

pulse checks
between formal engagement surveys we complete pulse checks approximately every six months to measure progress in categories with
our lowest scores in 2016 we tracked areas of focus from the 2014 survey to determine if initiatives put in place were successful in
each of the areas of communication vision and strategies and decision making we made substantial progress in the results in response
to the 2016 survey we will focus on key areas of technology process improvements and information sharing to help translate our high
engagement to better business results

we started the process of revamping our approach to pulse checks and will be implementing them in the rst quarter of 2017 we share
our results via electronic pulse check boards in each of our facilities

why managing it matters

our greatest asset is the southwire family and we can proudly say that multiple generations work for
us our heritage as a familyowned company inspires us to treat our employees like family and
contribute to their physical and emotional wellbeing healthy workers are essential to maintaining our
competitive advantage and an attractive culture


g4dma 


our approach
the wellbeing of southwire employees is a top priority positively in uencing their emotional physical and nancial health requires a
comprehensive approach therefore we have implemented several robust initiatives

southwire total rewards
southwire provides a broad and connected approach that promotes employees physical emotional and nancial wellbeing southwire
total rewards offers an extensive range of rewards to support diverse family needs and structures extending into our inclusivity strategy
of providing choices

to arrive at this comprehensive offering we began by asking how we could connect southwire families to these rewards and how we
could garner action to maximize them rather than simply listing all the bene ts we connected an action for employees for example
rather than simply offering medical bene ts southwire encourages focusing on my health instead of paying for time off southwire
promotes living my life join us on the journey of how we are engaging southwire families with their total rewards and continuing
these conversations for years to come

governance
we connect employee wellbeing with leadership at the highest level our senior director of living well reports to our executive vice
president of human resources who reports directly to our chief executive o cer for more on our southwires governance structure click

we relaunched our health committees to further assist employees in integrating healthy practices into their lives in 2016 22 committees
remained active these committees learned about our three newest additions in 2016 employee assistance programs quit for life and
livehealth online see below how results from our living well team challenge were used to engage our greater southwire teams
facilities outside the carrollton georgia area

employee engagement
in 2016 we conducted our annual biometric screenings with a 98 percent participation rate and screened 5373 employees southwire
prioritizes weight management and limiting tobacco use to improve employees physical health on february 1 2016 southwire launched
quit for life to assist employees in their effort to stop smoking with this implementation as well as turning legacy coleman facilities

into tobacco free campuses we have seen our employee tobacco use rate decrease from 225 percent to 177 percent with respect to
weight management our numbers remain constant approximately 80 percent of southwire employees have borderline or highrisk bmi
compared to a 69 percent national average

our greater southwire locations share the burden as their bmi and waist circumference scores are approximately 3 percent higher risk
than those in the carrollton area to engage greater southwire living well teams were tasked with generating ideas to get their facilities
healthy seven teams were awarded 500 to enact their ideas such as facility yoga classes step challenges group tennis lessons
holiday weight loss challenges and even a food logging challenge each team held successful events and supported their fellow
employees by increasing employee engagement and making living well a priority

onsite support
research shows the importance of making health easy for employees by creating a healthoriented environment southwire gives
employees the opportunity to make healthy choices through

  tobaccofree policies all southwire locations prohibit smoking and other use of tobacco on southwire property
  medical facilities in the carrollton georgia area home to approximately 40 percent of our workforce we offer an onsite medical
  center and pharmacy that has operated for more than 20 years our services are comprehensive and costeffective
  nutrition programs southwire presents nutritious options in our onsite cafeteria and vending we list healthful vending options at a
  reduced price to encourage their consumption track healthy purchases to better understand and accommodate employee preferences
  and offer payroll deduction at vending locations to improve access
  exercise programs we have onsite tness centers or in some cases where such centers are not established provide tness club
  membership stipends aside from exercise equipment our stateoftheart tness center in carrollton also coordinates group tness
  and education classes team sports and company athletic leagues intramurals include volleyball softball basketball ag football and
  more we track employee participation to better understand the effectiveness of our efforts to engage employees in physical tness
  we also held three youth sports camps over the summer baseball 50 participants basketball 34 participants and soccer 40
  participants as well as a kidfit exercise class 20 participants to engage our employees children and keep them moving while on
  summer break
  weight loss programs studies indicate that even moderate weight loss can make a positive impact in an individuals personal health
  as a highly competitive employee population challenges and competitions greatly motivate our employees to this end we run group
  and individual weight loss challenges and provide rewards such as fitbit activity trackers or in the case of our lose to cruise program
  free cruise vacations to successful participants other programs include new year new you new wardrobe which offers winners gift
  cards to their favorite retail outlets and viva las vegas which affords the winner a free trip to las vegas the grand canyon or other
  preselected locations our most recent challenge was the whole you challenge where an employee could win a prize worth 2500

why managing it matters

promoting a culture of inclusivity for diverse individuals bene ts both our business and our employees
as an employer searching for top talent and as a responsible supplier southwire maintains a strong
commitment to ensuring our workforce continues to re ect our complex and evolving world


g4dma 


our approach
southwire like other companies across the country is planning for major demographic and social changes over the coming years we
hope to attract and retain the top talent in our industry by promoting a culture that values varied thoughts and perspectives

diversity extends beyond physical characteristics to include diversity of thought and perspective which promotes a more innovative and
creative environment at southwire we believe an inclusive culture enables talent to ourish and encourages our employees to reach their
highest potential we believe that if we strive for inclusion diversity will naturally follow weaving employees into our community
regardless of their background demonstrates to all potential candidates that they have a home at southwire simply stated southwire
wants employees to feel empowered see diversity and experience inclusivity

southwire continues to develop and deploy tools and resources to connect employees with new perspectives whether it is through
southwires project gift activities the 12 for life mentorship program attending employee resource group functions or being part of a
sounding board which connects employees with executive management we continue to build programs that span a wide spectrum for
greater impact

governance
in 2016 we created a new senior leadership role responsible for building a comprehensive diversity and inclusivity strategy for the entire
organization we also began expanding our foundation for awareness by establishing three new employee resource groups composed of
employees from various business areas with each having its own executive sponsor we now have four groups building objectives to
create awareness and a more inclusive workplace for women people of color and a multigenerational workforce in both manufacturing
and corporate environments an inclusivity council was formed including members of the employee resource groups to provide input
directly to the executive leadership team with quarterly meetings we also conducted an executive workshop focused on unconscious
bias

data monitoring and reporting
we report diversity measurements along with national benchmarks quarterly to southwires board of directors and senior leadership to
objectively determine the inclusivity of southwires culture we track a variety of metrics

our employee engagement survey which measures the southwire employee experience enables us to track inclusion for example we
ascertain whether there are differences in how various demographics respond to the questions and whether the experience aligns with
southwires values

our quarterly human capital dashboard measures average years of service percentage of female employees average age percentage of
minorities biometric grades and turnover of high potential employees

   our neighbors depend on us just as we depend on them we will strive to improve the quality of
   life in the communities in which we work this goes beyond providing jobs and paying taxes it

education progams
12 for life
prior to 2007 the opening year of our 12 for life program carroll countys graduation rate hovered at 64 percent meaning one student in
three starting the rst grade that year would not graduate since southwires employment opportunities require candidates with diplomas
or geds southwire devised strategies to reverse this trend by collaborating with carroll county schools this partnership spawned our
awardwinning 12 for life program

this program serves the community by providing opportunity education and employment for atrisk youth it emphasizes that education
opens doors to success the program combines traditional classroom instruction with jobs inside a modi ed southwire manufacturing
environment students earn wages for their work and most importantly learn skills they will need after graduation southwires goal is to
increase graduation rates among atrisk teenagers through 12 for life by graduating 2020 students from the program by yearend 2020

since the programs inception our partnership expanded to include the florence city schools in alabama in january 2015 the council for
leaders in alabama schools named the 12 for life program of florence city schools a banner school the state of georgia and the
white house also adopted 12 for life as a model for increasing graduation rates

our approach
southwire monitors and mitigates risksboth within our business and beyond our operationsby providing robust ethics training to
employees engaging suppliers and adhering to and creating policies to support standards our leadership espouses the highest levels of
integrity and employees follow their example read about southwires strong governance structure and practices

we demonstrate our commitment to ethical business practices by publishing and providing all employees with an uncompromising ethics
statement during new hire orientation we introduce our code of ethics entitled do the right thing through a 10minute introduction
video from our chief executive o cer

ethics training
at southwire we strive to go beyond compliance requirements during our ethics refresher meeting we share examples of practices that
technically comply with the law but do not live up to our values or the spirit of the law we emphasize that these scenarios con ict with
our culture and can undermine our stakeholders positive view of southwire

prior to 2016 all salaried employees participated in a review course every two years to keep our ethical practices at the forefront of their
professional lives as well as introduce them to compliance topics such as bribery and antitrust beginning in 2016 all employees both
salaried and hourly receive comprehensive annual ethics training

we rmly reject any corrupt business activity and take measures to ensure our business activities advance internationally without ethics
incidents southwire provides anticorruption training to a signi cant number of executives and other salaried employees based outside
the us particularly beyond north america further we require mandatory training for all employees who travel abroad for business
purposes to prepare them for encounters with corrupt activities we conduct training in our employees native language to guarantee
clarity this training includes safety protocols which combined with our travel policies and procedures allows us to track the locations of
our employees as they travel and if necessary to swiftly extract an employee in the case of an incountry emergency

reporting ethics concerns

in the rst quarter of 2016 southwire completed implementation of an online code of ethics training and conducted an employee survey
of 100 percent of the employee population in the annual ethics survey all salaried individuals indicate if they or anyone they know has
violated ethics requirements or laws employees and stakeholders can report any ethics concerns to our legal department via hotline or
email all indications of ethics violations are thoroughly investigated we have few incidents violations or litigation

goal setting
in 2016 we set a new goal related to ethics and transparency southwire nds it important to have an independently vetted objective
measurement of corporate responsibility and business ethics benchmarking against the worlds most ethical companies will inspire and
inform advancement in our business practices we will begin reporting progress on this goal in our 2017 sustainability report




2021 sustainability goals  targets

                  product responsibility
   prioritizing sustainable attributes in products and packaging minimizing or eliminating the use of materials
   with negative health impacts and maximizing reuse of materials at end of life


why managing it matters

innovating and manufacturing sustainable products provides better value to our customers by
minimizing harmful materials reducing or eliminating waste at the job site and decreasing
installationrelated injuries and illnesses this gives southwire a competitive advantage


g4dma 


our approach
southwire takes pride in continually improving the value our products deliver to our customers we know that value is about delivering
more we design our products to be safer for usersboth during installation and for the people who work and live in the nished buildings
better for our planet and more costeffective for our customers

product responsibility drives much of southwires innovation and many of the innovations that we brought to market in 2016 align with
our product responsibility objectives to

  prioritize sustainable attributes including safety in products and packaging
  minimize or eliminate the use of materials with negative health impacts and
  reuse materials at the end of a products useful life

prioritizing sustainable attributes
southwire set a goal to incorporate sustainability principles such as reusability into at least 65 percent of all new research and
development rd projects by yearend 2016 when designing new products we consider our six sustainability criteria

1 minimizing the amount of resource materials including those that impact our carbon footprint

2 minimizing or avoiding the use of hazardous materials

3 using as much recycled material as possible

4 minimizing environmental impact during use phase of product

5 making our products for renewables as costeffective as we can and

6 developing products with a smaller carbon footprint

each division has a development team tasked with integrating these sustainability criteria into our new products during development we
test the products sustainability and capacity for responsible performance at our worldclass cofer technology center additional
personnel from our environmental legal marketing and sourcing departments scrutinize various aspects of the product and packaging
prior to public release

due to the success of the simpull reel we developed the simpull flange in 2016 to be used with smaller wooden reels the
simpull flange is reusable in the eld and can be installed on multiple reels throughout the jobsite its shaftless design safely allows
one person to turn a wooden reel up to 34 inches and 2000 pounds on a at level oor this design is a timesaving eldinstallable
solution that removes the need to handle heavy jack stands each ange rotates independently and allows free movement of the loaded
wooden reels


another product which exempli es southwires commitment to product responsibility is the tappan fire alarm cable in a simpull
coilpak wire payoff due to the marriage of the simpull nolube wire jacket and innovative simpull coilpak wire payoff design
physical effort associated with material handling pulling wire out of the package and through conduit has been reduced the durable
fully encased package also helps eliminate broken spools and protects the wire which is manufactured in accordance with the most
crucial re safety codes and regulations

minimizing materials with negative health impacts
while most of southwires business is in north america we do provide products to offshore customers and serve customers that sell into
overseas markets therefore we monitor market trends and requirements globally to maximize our potential customer base reduce
inventory and be everbetter stewards of the environment we are working with our suppliers to eliminate chemicals of concern identi ed
in european union reach registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals regulation and the european union
directive for the restriction of hazardous substances rohs

we plan to develop insulating compound alternatives to better manage the content of our products in response to our customers
perception of the end user effects we continue to increase inhouse formulation and compounding capability and invest in the necessary
equipment needed to meet this goal

reusing materials at end of life
the southwire tools  assembled products business unit participates in extended producer responsibility epr programs across north
america these programs seek to identify environmental costs and impacts that arise throughout a products lifecycle together with
these programs our tools  assembled products business unit developed products and packaging more compatibly designed for
collection and recycling the product care association call2recycleorg and several other organizations collaborate with us to help
manage the lifecycles of retail tools lighting timer packaging and lawn and garden products

building on our epr program experience we plan to launch internal compliance with the waste electrical and electronic equipment
directive weee a european endoflife regulation weee encourages the collection treatment recycling and recovery of electrical and
electronic equipment waste this falls in line with our longstanding tradition of going beyond regulatory requirements the weee directive
will primarily in uence our tools  assembled products operations

for utilities ordering materials with wood or steel reels we established a return program through this program customers have 12
months to return the reel for credit creating an opportunity for shared nancial and environmental bene ts between southwire and our
customers after the customer returns the reels we refurbish them through a partnering vendor and ship them with new product to see
this programs performance see g4en28 below

our senior vice presidents of rd and sustainability ehs  quality ensure that product responsibility continually progresses they update
our chief executive o cer every two months on the status of our current goals we assess our product responsibility performance
through consumer feedback and satisfaction as well as sales results we also publish progress on our sustainability goals every quarter

to ensure the quality integrity and transparency of our product responsibility we committed to producing epds for 25 products in key
markets by yearend 2018 due to lack of customer push this effort is on hold as we review other potential environmental andor health
declarations that may be more in line with customer needs

extensive vertical integration of our supply chain limits complexity and helps us guarantee a stable and steady source of inputs for our
operations additionally this enables southwire to apply our sustainable business practices directly to processes that might otherwise fall
outside our sphere of immediate in uence

southwire relies on three main groups for a strong adaptable supply chain raw materials providers logistics and contractors the
primary raw materials in our supply chain include metals such as copper and aluminum and a wide array of compounds used to insulate
and jacket our wire and cable such as pvc xlpe rubber and cpe most of these materials are sourced from suppliers in north america
south america and china

g4dma 


our approach
mitigating our negative impacts and maximizing our positive impacts extends beyond southwires direct operations we in uence the
sustainable business practices of our suppliers so that every input to southwire products is made with similar values on which we built
our familyowned business

governance
southwires executive vice president of distribution sourcing and manufacturing strategy oversees our supply chain sustainability
southwire also evaluates our strategic sourcing department on the sustainability of our supply chain

strategic sourcing and logistics
logistics are the most complex and extensive aspect of our supply chain effectively managing this complexity drives down costs for our
customers and reduces our environmental impact to the extent practicable we strategically source raw materials closer to the
appropriate manufacturing plant to limit distance traveled and we use intermodal transport whenever possible

we encourage our carrier contractors to participate in the epas smart way program in alignment with our fuel e ciency expectations
this program creates a winwinwin outcome our carriers save on fuel costs our logistics expenditure declines and the environment
bene ts from diminished carbon intensity carrier membership is dependent upon improvement from baseline statistics in various
categories to see our performance on the topic see g4en19 below

supplier relations
southwire recognizes the critical role suppliers play in our ability to deliver reliable value to customers we select our suppliers based on
their reputation and demonstrated service quality innovative technology and price to ensure our operations proceed without disruption
we work to uphold preferred status with our suppliers by maintaining steady demand

we collaborate extensively with the suppliers of our most signi cant inputscopper and aluminumto identify potential risks and
opportunities for example we participate in the copper club hold a series of meetings with the american copper council attend the
center for copper and mining studies cesco annual conference and meet with metals suppliers throughout the year

supplier sustainability program
along with our supplier relations initiatives we actively manage our supplier sustainability program which includes 26 critical suppliers
based on volume of spend criticality and risk located in north america 22 suppliers and china 4 suppliers these suppliers accounted
for 58 percent of raw material spend excluding metals and 22 percent of trading goods spend in 2016

to further enhance and develop our sustainability program we identi ed an additional 23 raw material key suppliers scheduled for audit
in 201718 these phase ii suppliers along with the original raw material suppliers account for a total of 80 percent of the raw material
spend excluding metals

through our supplier sustainability program we

  request participants submit environmental social and governance information annually
  ensure all participants complete an annual sustainability survey and
  conduct an onsite audit of participants environmental social governance and quality management systems

the southwire supplier sustainability manual details our expectations with respect to quality environmental social and governance
practices in our supply chain since the programs inception we distributed the manual to 100 percent of suppliers in the supplier
sustainability program companies acknowledge they have read the manual prior to or concurrent with southwires onsite audits to
communicate further our commitment to responsible procurement as part of the southwire sustainability program southwire completed
a supplier code of conduct which is provided as part of the program

several years ago southwire set a goal to deploy the southwire supplier sustainability manual throughout the supply chain with onsite
audits and performance monitoring in place for 100 percent of key suppliers by yearend 2016 which we successfully accomplished we
are now increasing our reach to an additional 23 suppliers with a stated goal of phase ii audit completion by the end of calendar year
2018 we report our progress on this goal and other metrics below

human rights policies
southwires human tra cking and con ict mineral policies align with our focus on supply chain sustainability these policies demonstrate
to our stakeholders that we actively address these pressing social issues and we associate with organizations that share our concern
southwire also requires all suppliers to complete a selfassessment outlining whether their materials comply with human tra cking laws
and con ict minerals reporting templates if applicable

supplier diversity
we consider supplier diversity an important aspect of a sustainable supply chain operating under southwires strategic sourcing
department our supplier diversity program ensures that southwire identi es

  quali ed small businesses and those owned and operated by minorities females or veterans in our strategic sourcing and procurement
  processes and
  opportunities to foster the development and advancement of diverse businesses when and where practicable

through the georgia minority supplier development council gmsdc southwire has access to the national database of certi ed
minority suppliers in addition to being a member of the gmsdc southwire will become a corporate member of the greater womens
business council which is the regional a liate of the womens business enterprise national council wbenc our a liation with these
diverse business groups will help us encourage and support our current quali ed suppliers to obtain their minority certi cations

some of our larger customers particularly utilities have their own supplier diversity goals to help them attain those goals we commit to
collaborating with diverse businesses and continually assess our progress we report our expenditures monthly or quarterly to our top
utility customers in addition southwire is developing a supplier diversity webpage that will include quarterly spend results and highlight
our diverse business partners

2016 accomplishments
to enhance our focus on supplier diversity within the strategic sourcing department we actively promoted the capabilities of diverse
suppliers we created an internal database organized by product category and encouraged buyers to include these suppliers in their
request for quotes regardless of the dollar value through this effort we added 73 diverse businesses to our list of approved suppliers in

2016 we will track the volume of requests from buyers to identify the category of diverse business needed we will also review bids
submitted to diverse suppliers and the results to determine areas where these suppliers provide the most value

we identi ed three internal supplier diversity champions one within sourcing and two in other functional areas of the organization who
excelled in their efforts to engage diverse business owners including personnel in other business groups expands the ownership of
reaching diversity targets beyond the strategic sourcing group

to increase our presence in an underserved business category southwire was featured on a panel at a procurement event aimed at lgbt
lesbian gay bisexual and transgender business owners through collaboration with our customers southwire partnered with a small
business for an installation project as a result we increased spend with certi ed hubzone historically underutilized business zones
businesses by 1 million over 2015


our performance
indicators 


by the end of 2016 southwire completed audits at 100 percent of our 22 key raw material suppliers the new target is to audit 100

revolutionary bim software helps to drastically improve productivity
and pro tability for electrical design and construction

contractors and electrical engineers are always looking for ways to
improve productivity and pro tability especially when it comes to
developing a construction work ow for electrical systems while most
contractors and engineers are familiar with building information
modeling bim they also know there isnt a truly e cient electricalonly
aspect of it until now aeries bim electrical software from
southwire is a new application for use with autodesk and revit
software as well as other leading industry platforms that breaks new
ground for e ciency in electrical design

what is aeries software
aeries software is a comprehensive and fullyintegrated electrical design and construction system that delivers streamlined
automation to every step of the installation process it enhances productivity during the preconstruction design phase streamlines
design team collaboration and eliminates wasted time and materials on the jobsite

aeries software can also provide a major jump forward for building information modeling by lling the gaps between cable
raceway physical design cable takeoffs the feeder schedule the installation planning process and ultimately through all required
procurement steps

aeries software connects the knowledge of the electrical engineer with the knowhow of the electrical contractor

aeries software one unique name that two groups will grow to love
aeries software which can interface with most leading design applications addresses three primary groups within todays
installation processes


  electrical engineers aeries software helps electrical engineers deliver consistent data equipment schedules feeder schedules and
  3d raceway models that include cable routing with all information in one single source data base it automatically routes raceway and
  wire and cable with accurate sizes and lengths saving time and helping to avoid calculation errors and duplicate data entries from
  occurring in the database the automatic cable routing process also complies with all national electrical code nec electrical raceway
   ll rules and regulations
  electrical contractors aeries software makes the process more e cient productive accurate and safer for the contractor the
  software delivers current product data sheets and automates bills of material estimates and the electrical design plan all which help to
  avoid inaccuracies and mistakes and keeps the job on schedule this bim solution automates all planning tracking estimating and all
  other procurement essentials this gives an accurate visual view of the installation progress aeries software can provide an
  accurate asbuilt representation as the major project progresses any design changes are done once and re ected automatically
  throughout the model this helps eliminate project delays and keeps the job on schedule

aeries software the necessary solution for the growing demand for bim technology in commercial and industrial construction
the adoption of bim is a growing trend in construction as contractors engineers and commercial builders look for ways to streamline the
construction work ow aeries software is a unique bim solution that is speci cally and purposefully built for electrical design and
planning meaning with this solution southwire customers can be on the leading edge of their industry when it comes to being more
e cient and productive on jobsites during both the planning and installation stages

auditing for a safer supply chain
southwire relies upon an uninterrupted supply of highquality raw
materials to continually meet our customers demands for superior
wire and cable to ensure a dependable supply of raw materials
southwire has developed and implemented a supplier sustainability
program which includes audits of our key raw material suppliers
excluding metals while these supplier audits cover many aspects of
the customersupplier relationship no aspect is more important than
environmental health and safety ehs performance

a great number of southwires suppliers have a deep commitment to
environmental health and safety compliance and a strong ehs culture
within their respective organizations many are iso 14001 and ohsas
18001 certi ed while some would even be considered world class in
their respective industries

even though the supplier audit program is relatively new it has already produced important ndings that will help our business partners
further improve safety within their facilities and the communities in which they operate making them more sustainable partners for
southwire southwire has asked all suppliers participating in the audit process to take action to address these ndings and report
corrective actions on all ehs recommendations

in the rst year of our audit program southwire has helped identify opportunities to reduce the risk of potential explosion hazards from
electrical arc ashes within supplier facilities and possible sources for combustible dust explosions and also recommended improved
handling practices for hazardous chemicals

we have learned so much from these audits already offered gary hubbard a divisional ehs manager at southwire its not just about
identifying improvement opportunities for our suppliers our team has walked away with some best practices that will improve our ehs

building and growing through employee engagement
southwire communicates openly and effectively with its employees
especially during challenging times in 2014 southwire acquired
coleman cable which represented the largest acquisition in the
companys history and formally created a new organization this led to
an integration and consolidation process that reduced the workforce
by 11 percent

throughout this period of tremendous change southwire remained
committed to its promise of measuring employee engagement this
was the exact right time to ask our workforce questions surrounding
job satisfaction we proceeded with the employee engagement survey
said kathleen edge executive vice president of human resources
business decisions needed to be made to invest in the longterm
sustainability of the company we did everything with openness
and transparency

surveys are only one part of southwires comprehensive employee communication and engagement strategy utilizing ceo videos pulse
check boards just ask southwire news network newsletters and a variety of other tools we strive to keep employees connected and
involved in the results and events that ultimately shape our business said edge our commitment to strong employee communication is
such that these communication mechanisms were the very rst human resource processes to be integrated

these communication tools provide speci c information and address unique parts of the companys engagement plan pulse check
boards provide realtime facility information about safety quality cost and morale southwire news network snn uses multimedia
displays at each location to communicate signi cant and timely updates and just ask enables employees to pose questions for
company leaders and facilitates change throughout the organization

southwires dedication to communicating openly with employees as well as providing opportunities for anonymous feedback leads to
higher than average participation in the companys engagement survey

with respect to involvement in the survey and the willingness to provide feedback we are encouraged by our 85 percent response rate
which is well above an external benchmark of 70 percent said kristian crowe southwires manager of employee communication and
engagement overall employees were 73 percent favorable within a healthy range according to external benchmarks our individual
target for employee engagement is to be in the 80 plus percent range

this communication strategy remains strong and southwire will continue to utilize the aforementioned vehicles to provide information
about updates events and initiatives to employees throughout the company

participated in collection drives for victims of the ooding in louisiana
thanks to the efforts of employees in bremen el paso mineral wells
starkville and carrollton as well as an incredible response from the
surrounding communities seven tractor trailers were lled with
supplies and sent to aid ood victims in baton rouge

on august 27 more than 20 blackshirt volunteers arrived in baton
rouge to distribute the collected supplies to ood victims after two
days of distribution the blackshirts understood how it felt to truly
make a difference several volunteers shared their experiences below

strategic buyer i was so proud to be a blackshirt they said to be there and see the impact we had was life changing the magnitude
of supplies we were able to offer the hundreds of people in need being able to ful ll those needs and the appreciation that each person
had touched my heart i was mainly helping with the baby items so i got to speak to the moms that were affected by the ood there was
one young lady with two small children who had lost everything after i asked her what size diapers she needed she broke down in tears
thanking us for all we were doing being a mom i could only imagine what she was going through and it was amazing to be part of
making a difference for that young lady and so many other people

safety specialist its something that you really have to be involved in to really get the feel for when someones going through you see
these people in need and youre able to make a difference it really makes you feel good about your company about yourself and about
your country ive worn a military uniform and it always gives me great pride wearing my blackshirt on that day i had a lot of pride and
distributing supplies to those in need really shows what a blackshirt represents

utilities managerworking for a team like southwire gave me a sense of pride helping so many people was inspiring as we were
working we were all getting tired but seeing the smiles on the faces of the hundreds of people through the pain and hardship they were
facing kept us going i am grateful to work for a company that helps so many people in different communities

project gift director we went to spread the word about disaster relief so we drove into baton rouge as we drove into a neighborhood
i was instantly taken aback by the devastation i saw a man shoveling debris in what used to be his front yard so i stopped and talked to
him he had lived in his house for 30 years and right in front of him it was destroyed he said he awoke to the sound of water ooding
into his house and all he had time to do was save his dogs his car and himself we asked him how we could help and he didnt ask for a
single thing he simply told us to get it to those that needed it it was amazing to me that despite the devastation that he endured he was
so positive he came to speak to all of our blackshirts and it really put into perspective what people were going through we donated him
a cooler full of bottled water and ice but he never once asked for anything i was touched by the strength that bobby had and i was proud
to be a blackshirt

human resources executive seeing personally the impact southwire has on communities was inspiring emotionally i dont think i was
prepared for the response we got but it was remarkable to see the sel essness in the community there was one women we met who
hadnt been affected by the ood but she drove by a couple who had lost everything they had no car so the woman picked them up
drove them to our distribution drive and waited in line for two hours to get them some supplies being there to witness the strength the
community had was a privilege and after sunday i can honestly say ive earned my blackshirt

ask employees of any company what makes a business successful
and nearly all will likely mention good communication that
communication can take many formsnewsletters email digests
blogs and town hall meetings while southwire uses each of these we
also encourage meetings that facilitate open dialogue between
employees and senior management

created more than a decade ago southwires sounding board allows
machine operators and supervisors to meet directly with senior
management including president and chief executive o cer stu thorn
over a meal they talk about family personal interests and recent news
they also discuss what is happening on the production oor and how
southwire is doing nancially

the sounding board truly exempli es our opendoor policy said kelley park vice president of human resources employees have a
direct line to senior management that allows them to make suggestions ask questions and get updates about how were doing as a
business and where we stand in our markets

at the same time manufacturing leadership hears from the front line about challenges and opportunities and receives suggestions for
improvement sounding board also provides an excellent means of managing rumors and ensuring accurate communication

rich carr vice president of manufacturing and one of the newest members of the companys management team echoed that thought
the sounding boards allow employees a seat at the table with key management said carr who is responsible for southwires oem
manufacturing operations they also give management an opportunity to speak to rumors and present a more positive message

as the company has grown so has the sounding board concept reaching plants across the company local managers sit down regularly
with employees to discuss local issues over lunch or dinner

for carr the sounding boards twoway dialogue provides better feedback than other communication options they are interactive and
collaborative he said adding that the group discussions also increase accountability on managements part we have to follow through
with some ideas carr said this has to happen all the way down the management chain we need to have a servant leader mentality if
we truly want to have engaged employees

some highlights from southwires contractor safety scorecard include

  requiring contractors to submit their experience modi cation rating emr and awarding them the full ve points if it is 1
  scoring contractors on the safety programs that they should have in place based on the work type they identi ed in a required and
  extensive questionnaire
  scoring contractors on that questionnaire by awarding points for certain questions such as whether or not their trir is below their
  naics code industry average or if they have received any safety or environmental citation or violations
  scoring contractors on whether or not they perform drugalcohol and criminal background checks on their employees and the safety
  training documentation for their work type

southwire uses all of this information to calculate a safety dashboard score for each contractor contractors with a safety score of a or b
may work with southwire our sourcing department tracks and utilizes this score if the contractor has a score of c or f they must put
other measures into place before a southwire site can use them however southwire prefers not to use them or to place them on a safety

improvement plan

in our continuous process improvement efforts southwire introduced onsite evaluations to the scoring system providing a running
average of all evaluations submitted for a period of 12 months as a contractor completes a project a southwire project manager
completes a contractor evaluation report on how safely they performed the workthis goes beyond prequali cation to show how safely
contractors work onsite moreover we have implemented incident reporting to their grade as well

with such strong safety emphasis training and requirements imposed on our contractors and in using the thirdparty vendor to assist
review and verify documents submitted by our contractors southwires average contractor trir for 2014 is 184 which is low compared
to our industry peers

southwire leadership academy fosters emerging leaders
southwires sustainable vision reaches to the very core of its people
their talent and their potential to succeed in the future as the company
continues to grow we aim to further enhance the skills of the existing
workforce and help foster and develop newly acquired talent

through the companys management succession and development
plan southwires talent management team met with senior leadership
in each division to identify key leadership functions that require a
sustainable pipeline of talent for the future and to recognize
individuals who have shown the potential to advance into those roles

those selected as key talent were then matched with the ve essences
of southwire a group of leadership attributes created by our board of
directors and chief executive o cer to outline the identity that de nes
and differentiates southwire leadership from other organizations

these are the traits that make southwire different said bryan preston vice president of talent management we want our leaders to do
these things so we need to gure out where the gaps exist where we want to be and where we are

from this assessment southwire identi ed some common areas for acceleration and the talent management team began to organize
the southwire leadership academy a full week of internal development for company vice presidents the 2014 curriculum focused on
 ve key development opportunities key content highlights from the event included participation in the herrmann brain dominance
instrument hbdi assessment a oneday concise messaging exercise business and collaboration strategy panels an emotional capital
workshop and a change management simulation

the hbdi assessment intended to provide perspective on individual thinking and communication preferences leverages the connection
between rationale and performance as related to the whole brain approach

for me one key takeaway from the event related to our hbdi pro les understanding your personal thinking preferences enables you to
optimize your ability to adapt your thinking decision making or communication style to a given situation said kelly hanson vice
president of marketing for southwires energy division as leaders it is important to understand your preferences so you can customize
your management style to each individual

participants were also provided the opportunity to engage with southwires chairman of the board and company shareholder roy
richards jr as well as southwires president and chief executive o cer stu thorn

it says a lot about southwire our senior executives and roy to make a weeklong commitment to develop this group said jason powell
vice president of nance as leaders we are typically not used to investing in ourselves but southwire is very serious about building
talent through events like the leadership academy were being provided with the tools in the tool box to improve ourselves and develop
future leaders

moving forward the intent for the southwire leadership academy is to cultivate potential leaders at many levels within the organization
as well as provide continuing opportunities for former participants

we want our participants to understand that they are special to southwire and integral to our overall success as a business but also that
they maintain a high level of responsibility said preston well continue to develop those who attend the leadership academy at our
alumni experience which will be a much higher level of collaboration and teamwork in a much shorter period of time

the alumni experience includes an assignment referred to as ceo for the day in which participants are asked to create a plan to
achieve a highlevel company goal and present that plan to a mock board of directors within a limited timeframe as in an actual ceo
environment participants are faced with unexpected circumstances throughout the exercise in which they must learn to adapt to
succeed

there is a genuine desire by the company to invest in the people and i feel fortunate to be a part of that said brad tuggle vice president
of nance for southwires industrial division the more equipped your people are to make decisions the better off your company will be
in the longterm and i believe we have that at southwire
