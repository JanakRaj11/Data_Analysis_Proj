strengthening
the snake                                       it takes a lot of time and hard work to reshape a river in 2016
                                                 idaho power took on that challenge starting with a big project
bayha island                                     on a small island in the snake river
research project                                 working with the freshwater trust river design group the us
                                                 fish and wildlife service and a cooperative private landowner idaho
                                                 power transformed a tiny remote snake river island into an ambitious
                                                 experiment aimed at improving snake river water quality

                                                   improving water quality is a primary goal of idaho powers
                                                   snake river stewardship program the snake river stewardship
                                                   program addresses water quality concerns downstream of hells
                                                   canyon as part of idaho powers application for a new federal
                                                   license to operate its three hydroelectric dams in hells canyon

                                                 in this section of the snake river warm water silted gravel on the
                                                 riverbed and heavy aquatic weed growth reduce water quality and
                                                 aquatic habitat to improve river conditions idaho power designed a
                                                 project that would use locallysourced gravel material to narrow and
                                                 deepen the river channel to reduce warming from the hot summer
                                                 sun a narrower deeper river will facilitate increased water velocity
                                                 and reduced solar heating this will allow more scouring flows cooler
                                                 water and less aquatic growth these improved conditions will provide
                                                 a healthier river system for fish plants and local fauna

                                                to create the improved conditions silted gravel was dredged from the
                                                riverbed and clean gravel was imported from an adjacent landowners
                                                property and placed on the newly formed channel this was completed
                                                around the perimeter of bayha and nearby wright island both part of
                                                the snake river islands unit of the deer flat national wildlife refuge

                                               we added about 50000 to 60000 cubic yards of material or
                                                approximately 10 acres to the islands said senior biologist stacey
                                                baczkowski the new acreage is below the ordinary highwater mark
                                                so we planted the area with native species

 housing screens which sometimes prevented the plant
 from running at full capacity                                after a few months of engineering and construction
                                                               the team finally got to see their innovative system
 the power produced by langley gulch is most needed            installed in fall 2015 just in time for the 2015 and
 during the cold winter months so the plant operators         2016 winter season which became the first winter
 knew they needed to find a way to keep the plant              since langley gulch opened that the plant could
 running smoothly                                             operate all winter without ice accumulation

our employees tried different approaches to removing           its very satisfying to see this solution work
 the ice but unfortunately there wasnt an easy way to          especially when you consider that we had

 after a few winters of removing the ice employees started
 considering options that might prevent ice from forming in
 the first place when they determined that no commercially
 ready solution was available the team devised a system to
 recycle a portion of the combustion turbines waste heat
 and route it back into the inlet air housing
