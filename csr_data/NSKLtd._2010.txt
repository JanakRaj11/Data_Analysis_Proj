     do you remember when the ecocar
     was a rarity not any more
     the pursuit of energy efficiency has become common practice nownot only in cars and consumer electronics but in
     factory equipment too almost everyone today agrees that we all have to work together to build a sustainable world
     where people can prosper while still preserving the natural environment the universal mantra now is that all
     machinery and devices have to become more energy efficient this cannot happen however unless new technologies are
     developed existing technologies are improved and both are shared with the world

     special article 2


     are you worried that the worlds
     energy supplies will run out
     today there is more and more hope that renewable energies like wind and solar power can help in the fight against
     climate change even when used to generate electricity renewable energy sources do not produce co2 emissions the way
     petroleum oil coal and other fossil fuels do best of all no one has to worry about things like wind and sunlight running
     out but some challenges remain we have to raise power generation efficiency and reduce costs if we really want to make
     the shift to natures renewable energy
