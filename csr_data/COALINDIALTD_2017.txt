coal for sustainable growth

coal is a vital and irreplaceable part of indias way of life and economy coal is an abundant energy
source there are over 860 billion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide this means that there is
enough coal to last us around 118 years at current rates of production in comparison to this proven
oil and gas reserves are equivalent to around 46 and 59 years at current production levels coal
outlasts oil and gas combined three countries russia iran and qatar control 53 of the worlds gas
reserves on the contrary there are recoverable reserved of coal in almost 80 countries ensuring
greater equitability amongst various nations coal has been backbone of key materials such as steel
cement and aluminium which are important element for human being existence on the earth coal
has contributed significant role for the growth of society in the last century coal still contributes to
30 of global primary energy consumption coal also accounts for 41 of the worlds electricity
generation it is the key fuel for generating electricity on almost all continents with almost all
developed and developing countries relying on coal for the stable and secure supply of electricity
there are 13 billion people in the world today who live without access to electricity26 billion people
rely on traditional fuels such as dung and wood for cooking a life lived without access to modern
energy is a life lived in poverty

coal has contributed to provide accessibility of electricity to major sections of society across the world
and further preventing forest depletion due to use of wood for fuel purpose conservation of forests
also act as major sink for carbon dioxide sequestration avoiding global warming impacts due to land
use change coal is still most affordable easily accessible and reliable source of power in many
countries

the international energy agency iea has predicted that more than half of the ongrid electricity
needed to meet their energy for all scenario would need to come from coal coal companies has
embarked upon major innovation drives such as promoting to raise average global efficiency of coal
plants to 40 would save 2 gt of co2

the significant mitigation potential of cleaner coal technologies including highefficiency low
emission hele coal plants and carbon capture use and storage ccus futuregen in the usa a
project supported by many coal companies that will upgrade a power plant with oxycombustion
technology to capture approximately 11 million tons of co2 each year  more than 90 of the plants
carbon emissions other emissions will be reduced to nearzero levels using safe and proven pipeline
technology the co2 will be transported and stored underground at a nearby storage site in australia
the coal21 initiative represents a commitment by the coal industry to reducing ghg emissions from
coal mines and coal use  and will spend more than a1 billion through the coal21 fund to reduce
its carbon impact the funds have come entirely from a voluntary levy from members of the australian
coal industry to develop low emission technologies for coal use including ccus in china the
greengen project an initiative supported by coal producers is chinas signature carbon initiative at
a full build of 650 mw greengen will be the worlds largest nearzero emissions coal plant with ccus
technology

coal mining  industry outlook

coal is the second most important energy source covering 30 of global primary energy consumption
hard coal and lignite brown coal is the leading energy source in power generation with 40 of
globally generated power relying on this fuel coal plays an important role in the security of supply in
developed countries and is a key enabler for economic growth and development in developing
countries while providing affordable and reliable energy developing countries are increasingly
satisfying their growing energy demands with coal in order to sustain economic growth to reduce
energy poverty and to achieve the united nations un sustainable development goals sdg the
levelized cost of electricity lcoe with regards to india shows that coal is expected to remain the most
affordable option through to 2035 this is driven by low domestic coal prices and limited gas
availability the link between access to affordable power from coal economic growth and prosperity
is clear the impact of coal on infrastructure development is more noticeable in developing nations

the world currently consumes over 7800 mt of coal which is used by a variety of sectors including
power generation iron and steel production cement manufacturing and as a liquid fuel in 2014
global coal production was approximately 57 billion tonnes coal equivalent about 77 of the coal
production was steam coal to be utilised in other industries and for power generation 13 was coking
coal to be used for coke production in the steel industry and 10 lignite china remains the worlds
largest coal consumer with a share of 50 consumption of steam coal is projected to grow by 20
from 2013 to 2040

india is the third largest coal producer in the world after china and the us the total coal production
in india was around 626 million tonnes mt in fy 2016 ninety per cent of the domestic production
comes from public sector coal producers while only 10 is produced by the private sector india
imported a total of 193 mt in fy 2016 which is equivalent to onefourth of the domestic coal
consumption in the country based on tonnage coal is majorly consumed for electricity generation in
india about 64 followed by steel 8 and cement 5 sectors about 62 of the installed capacity
as of 31 march 2016 in indias power sector is coal based and coal and lignite alone accounted for
77 of the energy produced by primary resources india a fast growing country with a tremendous
power requirement is dependent on power through coal to ensure energy security and in economic
development

with the economy poised to grow at the rate of 810 per annum energy requirements will also rise
at a reasonable level foreseeing the high demand of coal in the country the government has set a
goal of reducing coal imports to zero by 2020 this in turn will help to lower the reliance on expensive
coal imports and result in tremendous savings in forex for the country

business risks and opportunities

coal india produces about 84  of the countrys entire coal output we are the major contributor to
power sector with nearly 77 of our supplies power india more than 100 thermal power stations in
the country receive coal from coal india seeing the high demand of coal in the country in future the
government has set a goal of about 1 billion tonne bt coal production for coal india limited cil by



                                                                                            14  p a g e

fy 2020 in achieving the said target major business risks  opportunities that cil envisages are as
follows

business risks

       international coal prices are falling thereby rendering domestic coal more competitive
       changing economics of coal generated power in india renewable energies are becoming cost
        competitive even as coal faces increased regulatory scrutiny and public opposition
       petcoke as a substitute of coal
       cils attempts to access new mining areas will face opposition from local communities and
        environmental groups with its reliance on open cast mining access to new mines are
        essential for cil to achieve production targets
       difficulties in land acquisition along with increasing trend in prices of land and associated r 
        r issues are also points of concern for cil
       the major quantum of increase in production of cil is generated from the rise in production
        of low grades of coal which is not contributing significantly in the revenues of cil
       low irr percentage leading to nonviability of new projects



business opportunities

       demand from power u is likely to improve as reforms initiated by the government start to
        yield results in a few quarters
       cil is continuously aiming to supply coal to the neighbouring countries
       land acquisition and environmental clearances for expansion and growth of cil has been
        smoothened and prioritized
       improved coordination with railways also boosted the opportunities for cil as rake allotment
        during 201617 rose substantially to that in 201516
       longterm investment by cil in key and vital sectors like solar fertilizer etc
       we are investing in railway infrastructure projects for reliability and affordability of coal for
        consumers




                                                                                            15  p a g e

stakeholder engagement
stakeholders by definition refer to individuals and organisations who are affected by the activities of
a company either directly or indirectly and may have an influence over a companys business thus
they play a significant role in the overall growth and development of the company as a responsible
corporate citizen we consider it as our responsibility to develop and retain an amicable relationship
with all our stakeholders in practice we believe in extensive engagements with all our stakeholders
throughout the year to understand their concerns and address their issues the expectations and the
concerns of stakeholders  the extent to which the relevant issues are addressed play a vital role in
influencing the sustainable growth of an organisation we recognise contribution of our stakeholders
and assign due importance to their perceptions and concerns our philosophy is to respect the
perspectives of all stakeholders and prioritise the captured feedbacks received from them for
consideration during relevant decision making process in the organisation

during the reporting period we engaged with our stakeholders on various platforms that are detailed
below the key concerns that emerged out of these interactions have also been compiled the
information pertaining to stakeholders is periodically updated through formal or informal channel of
communication the perspectives of these high impact stakeholders are taken into consideration
while mapping the prioritized sustainability issues across important domains ie economic
environment labour practices human rights social and corporate governance etc




                                                                                            32  p a g e

a structured stakeholder engagement process provides the framework to identify the various risks
and concerns in a broader perspective enabling an organisation to develop suitable strategies to
address the important issues the outcome of the stakeholder engagement process is analysed to
identify and prioritise the material aspects to be considered by the organisation we are guided by a
comprehensive framework for stakeholder engagement the important stakeholders identified are

materiality analysis

materiality assessment is the process of identifying prioritising and defining the aspects that are of
highest importance to the stakeholders and the management of a company this sustainability report
covers topics that reflect our most significant sustainability impacts and opportunities for the
purposes of this report we regard material sustainability topics as those that may affect the longterm
success of our business including our ability to create and preserve economic environmental and
social value have the potential to influence the perception of communities of society by large
including those that make decisions and assessments based on our sustainability performance
materiality in this context is the threshold at which an issue or interest should be reported


we have identified focus areas representing the most significant challenges and opportunities facing
our company in t e area of sustainability which are the focus and foundation for our sustainability
strategy and the framework for this report our materiality analysis process allows us to further define
our report content by identifying material topics within these focus areas as well as to identify key
risks and opportunities outside these focus areas our process is informed by guidance from the global
reporting initiatives technical protocol  applying the report content principles and from account
abilitys fivepart materiality test

our assessment of the material aspects was based on the inputs and various engagements we have
had during the year with different stakeholders we prepared an extensive list of concerns stated by
our stakeholders based on this list we attempted to prioritise the most material aspects of the stake
holders these aspect were then assessed qualitatively by our management team finally we have
come up with a materiality matrix that is an amalgamation of both the stakeholder perspective and
management perspective the materiality matrix determined was plotted on a 2x2 matrix and the
aspects were plotted on the basis of their relevance to the management and their significant impact
on the stakeholder

key risks and mitigation

material aspects were identified and strategies for effective risk assessment and mitigation program
were laid for longevity of our business the issues both relevant to management and stakeholders of
highest priority are mentioned below
rehabilitation and resettlement
within this context the mining of coal happens with a process that aims at making the life of the
community around the mines much easier to begin with the assessment of the new mining areas
happens only after the evacuation of people from these areas takes place this evacuation happens in
phases by relocating the local community with ample compensation for the land that they stand to
lose to the larger cause of coal energy production opposition from the local communities as well as
the environmental groups is dealt with in a sensitive manner so as to meet the land acquisition
challenges without intensifying the situation a trend of increasing land costs and associated r  r
issues are tackled by us in this regard

we are sensitive to the fact that monetary compensation may not fulfil the emotional chasm that
many of these land owners and community dwellers are unable to bridge when they have to relocate
our efforts in this direction include satisfactory r  r for land out sees with a focus on engaging the
local communities and catering to their demands to the best of our abilities compensation packages
and engagement efforts lie at the centre of our endeavours and policies in this regard our hope is to
further evolve our r  r system to provide better avenues for the relocated families



                                                                                          35  p a g e

supply of quality coal

our consumers mainly from power sector requires supply of coal on time and good quality retaining
consumers loyalty is an important aspect for successfully staying in business due to the improved
despatch and better quality of coal import of coal to india had reduced during 201617 in this
reporting period we have built coal handling plant of capacity 320 mtannum 22 new coal washeries
and renovation of 05 existing washeries combined capacity of 1237 mtpa are in various stages of
planning commissioning surface miners have been deployed by cil for selective mining at some of
the ocp mines to improve quality of coal action is being taken for deployment of more surface miners
in other ocp mines where geomining condition permits their usage
health and safety
to foster a safe and healthy work environment we are continously working for social wellbeing of
stakeholders and in the areas related to mining methods strata control and mine safety etc we have
deployed adequate numbers of trained manpower for ensuring safety in mining operations a well
structured and multidisciplinary internal safety organization iso established in all the subsidiaries
of cil to monitor the implementation of cils safety policy continuous and sustained improvement
in technological inputs for mining operation and ensuring workers participation in every forum for
monitoring safety status in mines also collective commitment and synergetic collaboration of the
management employees the regulator dgms and trade unions

regulatory compliance

compliances are a must for any mining organisation we understand the criticality of deviating from
desired regulations in terms of long term continuity of our operations hence for good business
conduct we adhere to all essential regulatory norms and meet the necessary compliances before the
opening of any new project we ensure that we obtain all necessary clearances including
environmental clearances and forest clearances prior to that we conduct environment impact
assessments and analyse the likely effects on all potential stakeholders in the vicinity and plan for the
required mitigation measures accordingly

vigilance and anticorruption
 we are geared with the necessary vigilance machinery to prevent such incidents in our organisation
coal loading and coal transportation areas are prone to coal thefts for effective monitoring and
prevention of the same we have introduced several technologies enabled interventions in
continuation of these efforts we have also attempted to make systemic improvements and promote
a preventive vigilance approach for the last few years we have also strengthened our efforts towards
creating awareness among employees with enhanced opportunities for open dialogue with them to
imbibe a culture of transparency




                                                                                            36  p a g e

economic performance
out of indias total coal production in the financial year 1617 the share of cil is around 84 so the
impact of cil on indian economy can be easily equated with the impact of coal sector in indian
economy india is the worlds third largest energy consumer and its energy use is projected to grow
at a rapid pace supported by economic development urbanisation improved electricity access and
an expanding manufacturing base despite increased growth in other sources coal will remain the
major source of electricity generation in indias energy sector coal accounts for the majority of
primary commercial energy supply with the economy poised to grow at the rate of 810 per annum
energy requirements will also rise at a reasonable level one of the primary goals of the government
of india is to ensure that it is able to meet the countrys power generation needs for achieving this
goal cil needs to play the major role

the government had launched the power for all campaign in april 2015 under which it plans to
provide affordable power to all houses by 2019 india has more than 300 bt of coal resources out of
which around 90 are noncoking coal but despite this noncoking coal accounts for nearly 7580
of the indias coal imports in order to meet this massive demand and minimise the imports of coal
especially noncoking coal the government has put coal production in the country on fast track and
has set a target of 15 bt of domestic coal production by fy 2020 to meet this target the government
has set a goal of about 1 bt coal production for coal india limited cil by fy 2020

india has witnessed a twofold increase in its total raw coal consumption in the last 10 years coal is
majorly consumed for electricity generation in india about 64 followed by steel 8 and cement
5 sectors so naturally for the development of the core industrial sectors the support of coal india
is undeniable

cil and its subsidiaries have achieved an aggregate pretax profit of rs 1443371 crores for the year
201617 against a pretax profit of rs 2158909 crores in the year 201516reinstated as rs
2143980 cil as a group had achieved a total comprehensive income of rs 934798 crores in 2016
17 excluding share of minority loss of rs 025 crore previous year rs 004 crore compared to rs
1427433 crores in 201516 reinstated as rs1456119 crores



production of raw coal during 201617 was 554140 mt against 538754 mt produced in 201516 with
a growth of 285 coal production from underground mines in 201617 was 31477 mt compared to
33786 mt in 201516 production from opencast mines during 201617 was 9432 of total raw coal
production coal offtake was 543319 mt with a growth of 17 compared to the last year due to the
improved despatch and better quality of coal import of coal to india had reduced during 201617 it
improved the mine geometry and made the mines safer to operate it also augurs well for more
production in 201617 in the light of paris protocol and consequent upon changes in world energy
sector scenario cil is looking forward to diversify its operations towards renewable energy like solar
power and clean energy sources like cmm cbm ctl ucg etc following the directives of goi
following to that mission moccil is in the process of formulating vision document 2030 to decide
upon future course of operation for sustainable entity in the nations energy sector

coal transportation
in the year 201617 cil dispatched 543159 mt of coal  coal products against the aap target of
598031 mt ie an achievement of 908 cil has dispatched 85 mt of coal and coal products more
than last year with a growth of 16 425397 mt of coal and coal products including despatches
under special forward eauction to power was despatched to the power utilities against the target of
450990 mt ie an achievement of 943 this is 123 mt more than last years dispatch of 413109
mt which also includes despatches under special forward eauction to power resulting in a growth
of 3

overall dispatch by nonrail mode had been 919 of the target growth in despatches via rail mode
was 41  whereas in the overall nonrail mode it decreased by 14  road despatches decreased
by 06 compared to the previous year movement by mgr also decreased by 35 compared to
last year despatches through other modes like belt  rope increased by 57  compared to the last
year

overall wagon loading materialization was 909  of the target this was achieved due to sustained
efforts and regular coordination with railways at different levels the increase in loading over last year
was of 91 rakes per day wagon loading could have been even better but for the regulated lifting by
power utilities almost in all the subsidiaries less demand for higher grade coal from ecl and secl
intermittent law and order problem in ccl and mcl also affected rail dispatch performance

coal marketing

supply of coal was made to various consumers including power sector under the applicable provisions
of new coal distribution policy due to overall deficit in availability of coal considering the projected
coal production from domestic sources and commitments made through signing of fsasissuance of
letter of assurances loa supplies under fsas has been pegged at various level of commitments
trigger power sector being the major consuming sector having significant importance in the
economy supplies to power sector has been guided as per the various government directives and
polices

offtake of raw coal continued to maintain its upward trend and reached 543319 million tonnes for
fiscal ended march 2017 surpassing previous highest figure of 534496 million tonnes achieved during
the last year ie an increase of 17  over the last year the overall raw coal offtake achieved was
908  of the annual action plan target in the year 201617 ecl ccl ncl mcl and nec could
outperform their achievement of last year

power houses started the year with huge stock of 387mt and regulating intake preferred to consume
from stock wagon availability also sporadically affected offtake at different subsidiaries some places
logistic bottleneck had also come in the way of augmenting offtake tpps were particularly reluctant
to take coal from cost plus sources some of the initiatives undertaken to enhance offtake are as
follows

       regular coordination with railway board to optimize use of logistics resources available in
        the subsidiary coal companies analysing inputs of the subsidiaries to identify alternate source
        for coal movement wherever and whenever required to achieve overall sectoral targets and
        mitigating critical fuel requirement of consuming sectors particularly power stations
       coordination with moc for various long and shortterm policy decisions to overcome coal
        movement constraints for power and nonpower sector consumers and taking operational
        decisions for moving coal from various sources on contingent situations to meet critical
        requirements of consuming sectors particularly power utilities etc
       periodic meetings and follow ups with power producers in addressing issues relating to coal
        movement
       source rationalization of coal linkage for optimizing coal movement as per the requirement
        of the consumers and logistics
       logistics is one of the major hurdles in reaching coal to the consumers capacity constraints
        both in terms of track and rolling stock are coming in the way for achieving the requisite
        growth in order to boostup the rail transport system following initiatives have been taken
       spvs by the coal companies with the state governments and railways for creating rail
        infrastructure  two spvs have already been formed at chhattisgarh for creating rail
        connectivity at korbaraigarh similarly spvs were also incorporated at jharkhand and odisha
        for similar initiatives on 31st august2015
       three major last mile rail connectivity projects at jharkhand odisha and chhattisgarh have
        been brought under pmo monitoring mechanism to ensure commissioning as per the
        schedule
       special attention is given for improving coal distribution network for small and medium and
        other sector consumers cil organized meeting with state governments to streamline the
        process of nominating distribution agencies by them
       coal companies started supplying 100 mm crushed coal to its consumers wef january2016



                                                                                                        45  p a g e

special eauction schemes

from the year 201516 special forward eauction scheme which was introduced by moc for meeting
the coal requirement of power plants is being continued during 201516  201617 around 138 mt
 47 mt coal was booked by consumers under this scheme of eauction respectively a similar scheme
for consumers in the non  power sector was also launched as exclusive eauction scheme for non
power during 201516  201617 around 15 mt  around 62 mt coal was booked by nonpower
consumers under this eauction respectively special spot eauction was also conducted once in 2016
17 with the objective for liquidating coal stock especially from the high stock mines and to provide
scope for procuring coal at a competitive price by the consumers of nonspecified end use around 62
mt coal was booked in this eauction

web portal for msme sector

the web portal coal allocation monitoring system was launched on 17th march2016 by minister
of state with independent charge for power coal and new  renewable energy along with the
officials from ministry of coal and coal india limited at new delhi the portal aims to ease the conduct
of business for small and medium sector consumers having annual requirement of less than 10000
tonnes of coal the portal will make the system of distribution of coal to such consumers through state
nominated agencies more transparent it has the following advantages

       ease of doing business for consumers
       accountability on the part of the govt and its enterprises
       24 x 7 access of information on supply and distribution of coal in public domain
       online registration and feedback system for consumers for improving the system
       transparent coal distribution
       state and consumer awareness
       peer audit among stakeholders

customer satisfaction
our motto and core driving principle is to identify and deliver the needs of cunsumer and adopt a
consumer centric approach to provide better service to consumer for enhanced customer
satisfaction special emphasis given to quality management attuned to this objective it was decided
that 201718 will be declared as quality year in order to monitor quality right at the coalface officer
in charge of mining have been given target to contain grade slippages within 10 another giant step
to ensure proper quality was independent assessment of grades of 871 mines loading points
fractions through various academic institutes of national repute by cco based on the analysis reports
received from these institutions cco finalized the grades of different minessidings for the year 2017
18 although the results of regradation of about 49 mines loading points fractions were not
encouraging correction enhance confidence of consumers in order to monitor coal quality
internally a portal has been designed by cil to capture entire life cycle of sample with the help of
portal analysis of coal quality on regular basis will be possible

cil has built up coal handling plant capacity of about 320 mt per annum so as to maximize dispatches
of crushed sized coal to power sector cil is supplying  100mm sized coal to all power plants w e
f 01012016 except those at pit head in addition mobile crushers have been installed to meet the

                                                                                            46  p a g e

additional crushing requirement emphasis has been given for maximum production through surface
miners for this surface miners have been deployed for production of coal in mines wherever
technically  commercially feasible deployment of this technology at ocp mines is bound to improve
coal quality at present 75 surface miners are working in opencast mines in addition the washeries
at bccl ccl wcl and ncl have crushing sizing facilities to the tune of about 368 million tonnes 22
new coal washeries and renovation of 05 existing washeries are in various stages of planning
commissioning measures like picking of shalestone selective mining by conventional mode
adopting proper blasting proceduretechnique for reducing the possibility of admixture of coal with
overburden material  improved sizing of coal etc are being taken for those mines having large inter
bands of shalestone installation of deshaler has been planned joint third party sampling  analysis
is in vogue for major consuming sectors eg power utilities steel cement and sponge iron entire
supplies to power sector are covered under third party sampling  analysis large consumers having
annual quantity of 04 mt or more and having fsa covered under sampling for the first time sampling
facility has been extended to consumers of special eauction for power sector and linkage auction
through iitism and qci consequent to issuance of letter of intent these agencies have been advised
to enter into tripartite agreement with consumers and the coal companies to start the process

area laboratories of subsidiary coal companies have been equipped with 121 bomb calorimeters for
accurate and transparent results of analysis of coal samples 28 labs across the subsidiary cos have
already got nabl accreditation and another 27 labs accreditation process is underway it is expected
that standardization of the process as per nabl standard will go in a long way to enhance customers
confidence about the process of assessment of coal quality and facilitate quality monitoring the
guidelines sop issued by moc vide letter dated 26112015 on third party sampling at loading ends
has already been implemented through central institute of mining and fuel research cimfr
sampling for almost entire quantity covered under fsa is continuing across various loading points of
coal companies

electronic weighbridges with the facility of electronic printout have been installed at rail loading points
to ensure that coal dispatches are made only after proper weighment for this purpose coal
companies have installed 157 rail weighbridges in the railway sidings and 569 road weighbridges for
weighment of trucks coal companies have also taken action for installation of standby weighbridges
to ensure 100 weighment 24 auto mechanical samplers ams are also working in subsidiary coal
companies for coal sampling eliminating chances of biasness in sampling process procurement of
further amss is under process the process has already been initiated to deploy augur sampling for
drawing more representative samples 01 online analyser in each subsidiary company has been
envisaged on trial basis

in order to ensure consumer satisfaction and resolve consumer complaints special emphasis has been
given to quality management and redressal of consumer complaint online filing and redressal of
complaints has been initiated percentage of consumer complaints resolved is 9942  during the year
201617

by bringing global sustainable development framework into practice and assessing environmental
impacts by our actions we have taken ourselves way ahead of others in the sustainability curve we
are continually doing gap analysis to align with international standards and evolving on all fronts

coal india limited cil has an ambitious goal to cater to the energy requirement of the country by
producing 615 mt of coal as per the xii plan projections by fy 201617 which is about 64 annual
average growth rate over what is being produced today this production is to be achieved with
due consideration and compliance of the stringent environmental stipulations one of the most
important statutory provisions which have a direct impact on increasing the production is the
compliance of eia notification 2006 at the same time a number of new statutes have come
into force making the environment compliance as one of the most important requirement for
the company with mine planning design and operations that emanate from the same we try and
imbibe a responsible stance with the help of emp or environment management plans and clearances
that are built into the way we function from start to finish our commitment is based on
environmentally ethical and socially sustainable growth even as we keep the economic angle in strong
perspective

cil has a dedicated strength of 349 executives and 278 nonexecutives to look after the environmental
aspects
sustainable mining
mining is a process which requires extraction of soil within the surface and beneath resulting in
removal of natural resources we may not adjourn our socioeconomic needs but practice to have
optimal utilization of resources to have sustainable environment striking a balance with human needs
with nature has been need of mining industry

global requirement for energy in last few decades has resulted extraction of nonreplenish able
natural resources with finite sources of coal the responsibility to conserve and do friendly mining by
coal companies globally resulted in joining hands sharing best practices and adopting sustainable
practices for environment protection government of countries and global coal association have
joined hands in hands to bring awareness in sustainable mining practices and sharing their best rd
systems successful mining of the prospect and must do restoration of the mined land with minimal
environmental impact requires extensive environmental management plans in the course of mine
closure planning mining industry with profits in one hand and socioeconomic balance in other hand
encourage sustainable mining

cil is aware of limited nonrenewable fuels and taken responsibility to restore mother earth the
rehabilitation and resettlement policy of coal india ensures better relocation cost of shifting
employment and rehabilitate them with consultative and transparent process best and latest
practices followed globally is adopted by us to make mining environmental friendly

cil has signed mou with national environmental research instituteneeri nagpur to carry out
studies monitoring and collaborative research work for sustainable coal mining in cil neeri is also
studying on the effectiveness of supplying deshaleddrybeneficiated  washed coal reduction in ash
content by 56 to power plants following all pollution control measures neeri will submit
environment management plan for mitigation of impact on regional environmental quality due to
supply of deshaled  dry beneficiated coal to power plants in context of prevailing pollution control
practices




                                                                                           50  p a g e

impacts due to mining are not only related to environmental but also social during mining and post
mining risks of land usage by the community in as is form needs a lot of attention and commitment
the major impact due to mining are

         soil degradation
         pollution of the water
         dump of unusable waste
         removal for flora and fauna
         noise pollution
         air pollution
         deforestation
         harm to marine life

entrusting a huge responsibility of responsible mining cil has imbibed the sustainable environmental
culture across all its subsidiaries in india and globally the strategy enacted to mitigate environmental
burden due to mining activities by cil

         protection of existing environment and maintaining ecological balance
         restoration of water bodies and creating mined area for rain water harvesting
         creating artificial water ponds and picnic spots
         emphasis on afforestation
         comprehensive monitoring post mine closure
         fencing of the mines to avoid mishappening
         preventing access to mined locations
         waste management and proper dumping of mined waste

within our special ventures for environment protection and preservation we have aimed to act in a
responsible manner by adhering to the regulatory norms and standards laid down by the higher
echelons of power and authority accordingly we also have a corporate environmental policy that
guides us as far as our environmental initiatives go third party certifications like the prestigious iso

clearances as well as an eiaemp that will take care of the needful also we take pollution control
measures even as we indulge in mining operations so as to maintain acceptable levels of the
environments major physical attributes including the air water hydrogeology noise land flora and
fauna and the nearby population during the year 201617 the cmpdi has prepared15 form  i and
formulated 22 drafts of eiaemps 17 environmental clearances were also obtained from moef for
different projectsgroup of mines washeries and sand mining projects of cil our major focus has
also been on creating awareness within the organisation regarding the importance and the way
forward for these initiatives with the celebration of the world environment day in all our subsidiaries
apart from this we also regularly post banners and thoughts on the notice boards to communicate
these points on a formal and informal basis


no known incidents of noncompliance in terms of environment protection and standards have been
reported during this reporting year we have managed to post precious manpower directly to the
fields of operation to work closely with the local communities and make compliance a regular affair
benefitting from each other forms the core principle when it comes to improved disclosure through
annual reporting on the compliances


energy
india being a developing country has its dynamic energy requirement almost 70 of electricity
generation is through thermal plant a small amount of energy comes from green energy or nuclear
energy leading to dependency on coal as a fuel to produce energy for industrial and social
requirements

fulfilling the energy requirement and leaving a greener footprint is the prime moto of cil we have
focused on continually identifying opportunities to improve energy efficiency cil has mined on
inorganic opportunities and created opportunities for energy sources cil developed faith and capital
opportunity to villagers near mines by providing the same energy to restore the developed
biodiversity by cil and created awareness

coal being a nonrenewable energy source should be mined considering the energy requirement cils
commitment to conserve environment mine as per human requirements without overexploiting the
natural resources makes is sustainable on all economic social and environmental aspects

coal mining operations are energy intensive and involve the use of high amounts of fuel and electricity
while the fuel consumption is due to the usage in our hemms an insignificant quantity of the same
is also used for the dg sets

adopting energy efficiency programs and conservation of energy
conservation of energy always remains a priority area and cilsubsidiaries have extensively exercised
various measures towards reduction in specific energy consumption

coal production during 201617 is 55414 million tonne mt visàvis 53875 mt during 201516 with
a growth of 29 from previous year electricity consumption has however reduced during the same
period 201617 488683 million units visàvis 497113 million units mu during 201516 with a
reduction of 17 in absolute terms

specific power consumption kwht during 201617 is 882 kwht visàvis 923 kwht during 2015
16 with a reduction of 442 from previous year

cilsubsidiaries endeavour to maintain this trend of reduction in specific power consumption kwht
every year wrt previous year

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        53  p a g e

      cmpdil hq has undertaken energy conservation studies in 201617 and carried out diesel
         audit  benchmarking of specific diesel consumption as well as electrical audit 
         benchmarking of specific electrical energy consumption in various opencast and underground
         mines situated in different subsidiaries of coal india limited by bureau of energy efficiency
         bee accredited energy auditors
      diesel audit and benchmarking carried out by cmpdil in 71 opencast mines in different
         subsidiary companies of cil revealed for an aggregate saving potential of approx 16750 kilo
         litreyear in diesel consumption
      these 71 opencast mines are selected having composite capacity coalob of 10 million m3
         or more in ecl 20 million m3 or more in bccl wcl ccl and 50 million m3 or more in ncl
         secl and mcl respectively

likewise electrical audit and benchmarking carried out in 08 mines 07 opencast mines and 01
underground mine revealed for an aggregate saving potential of approx 110 million unitsyear
     a mou has been signed between cil coal india limited and eesl energy efficiency services
        limited on 08022016 for implementation of energy efficiency projects in cil and its
        subsidiaries
        accordingly high watt luminaries  conventional light fittings are being replaced with low
        power consuming leds of appropriate wattage in majority of the places for street lighting
        office and other work places townships etc thereby creating huge saving potential in
        electricity consumption around 64000 led lights have been fitted new  replacement in
        cilsubsidiaries for better conservation of energy
     air conditioners ac and refrigerators of 5 star rating are procured against replacement of
        old conventional acs and refrigerators use of super energy efficient air conditioners ac are
        also being explored at places having technical capability of saving energy 30 more than the
        5 starrated acs
     energy audit of selected mines  office buildings by cmpdil  external agency
     installation of power capacitors of appropriate kvar rating to maintain higher power factor
        to avail maximum benefit on power factor incentive from power supply agency as well as
        reduction in maximum demand aggregate power factor maintained at cil subsidiaries is as
        high as 95 during 201617
     auto timer based onoff switches in most of the street lighting  chps and township areas to
        ensure avoiding unnecessary power consumption during odd hours thereby saving in
        electricity consumption
     construction of strata bunkers in underground ug mines to eliminate idle running of belt
        conveyors thereby saving electricity
     reorganization of lt low tension overhead line by aerial bunched cable to avoid
        unauthorized power tapping
     monitoring of load pattern and demand side management of supply points limiting maximum
        demand wherever practicable by staggering avoidable load from peak hours to offpeak hours
     elimination or reduction of stage pumping as far as practicable
     reorganization of power distribution system
     power supply to underground mines by laying cables directly through bore holes wherever
        feasible

the above measures taken for energy conservation are indicative only and not exhaustive


                                                                                          54  p a g e

air emissions
mining operations often use explosives that are employed for blasting as well as machinery that has
to be deployed for mining and vehicular movement and transportation of coal and obwe endeavour
to keep generating sox and nox within statutory limit yet we monitor these parameters on a regular
basis so as to ensure that the emissions are within specified limits and standards

we monitor the ambient air quality in and around the mine site on a fortnightly basis with a
continuous ambient air quality monitoring station four locations in secl now enjoy the installation
of these station with caaqmss are being installed at three locations in bccl one in wcl and 10 in
ncl cil has agreed to install 16 caaqms in the different cities of country as decided by cpcb during
the year the emissions from different monitoring stations have been recorded and are elucidated in
the table on the right
we are also taking initiatives to mitigate the dust that is generated during the operations of drilling
blasting loading coal transportation of coal and related activities

since mining process includes drilling blasting cutting materials handling crushing ore processing
etc which creates lot of pollution cil used latest technology and conveyor for proper material
movement to reduce the emissions cil has engineered water sprinkling at appropriate places
administrative measures ensured that same workers are not exposed to the environment for long by
rotational work routine of employees the measures taken are based on the environmental
management plansemp already prepared before commencement and enhancement of coal
production within the coal mines

we ensured proper safety guards are provided to employees who are in the front line of control and
directly getting the exposure to dust

under the project telerobot has been developed and field trail conducted at khottadih mine of ecl
the developed robot is capable of monitoring environmental parameters viz percentage of co2 ch4
o2 and also humidity  temperature the real time graphicaluserinterfacegui based navigational
camera is capable of displaying the status of robot and 3d representation of operational environment
in the underground mines from sensor data

the parameters monitored as required by regulatory authorities are suspended particulate matter
spm sox and nox to ensure compliance across various operating units of cil these parameters are
monitored as per the stipulations of moef the monitoring of pm under 10 micron and 100 micron
are being done in and around the mine areas residential and village areas value of the parameters
are in mostly found within the limit of stipulated standards continuous ambient air quality
monitoring stations have been installed at 4 locations in secl and 01 location of wcl

            2006 and its reports are regularly submitted to spcbs and moef  cc
           the concept of continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations caaqms are being
            introduced and are installed  being installed in large mines of cil


green belt development

we have adopted the green belt development as a part of our mitigation measures for air pollution
as an imperative step towards creating a more positive impact tree plantation is being conducted on
a regular basis on reclaimed land in back filled  ob dump areas with plantation in and around mines
road sides townships and residential areas and other available vacant spaces further the
implementation of a conservation plan for the protection of flora  fauna is being carried out as per
environmental clearance ec this is being done in addition to the compensatory afforestation for
diverted forest in terms of mining for the degraded forest these areas have been marked by the state
forest departments the plantation has created man made forests in mining areas where there was
minimum forestation this improves the ecological balance by maintaining stability in the ecosystem
services available and what we use for our business

water conservation
the united nations general assembly in july 2010 declared access to clean water and sanitation a
must for human beings the global effort to bring down the water usage primarily for mineral
processing dust suppression and sludge

the quality of living environment desires efforts to restore water in its surface and subsurface the
obligation to conserve and harvest water has been imbibed at cil to make them a responsible
corporate we have doing rain water harvesting in our facilities to top up the water requirement at
mines location

owing to commitment to conserve water we have been reusing mine water for domestic purposes
water consumption pattern water which pumped out from the underground and open cast mines
are being contaminated with suspended particles some small quantity of water being contaminated
during washing and cleaning of hemm cil also takes initiative by treating this water


                                                                                             59  p a g e

with the identification of needs for conservation and effective utilization of the natural resources cil
is committed towards providing ecofriendly facilities to the communities with sustainable
development activities in the peripheral villages the objective of cil is for maximum utilization of
mine water for the community use accordingly steps have been taken up for making water available
round the year to the community for irrigation and other domestic uses there are 15 04 47 rain
water harvesting projects of ecl wcl and ncl respectively which also serve as a source of water for
the community through all its projects cil is reaching a total number of 89 lakh beneficiaries

acknowledging the fact that the ponds hand pumps and wells are the only source of water for the
villagers the project will be planned in a way that is beneficial for the villagers this will ensure that
there is availability of water round the year for their day to day and more importantly their
agricultural needs the ponds that have been constructed and renovated can be used for allied
activities such as fisheries as well after completion of the work it will be handed over to the local
administrative arrangements like panchayats and gram sabhas to be owned and managed by the
community so that persistent use of the same continues



mine water management

treatment of contaminated water is a constant effort that we undertake at cil this is due to the fact
that water which pumped out from the underground and open cast mines is contaminated with
suspended particles and the water used for cleaning of hemms gets contaminated too the treated
water is routed to the local villages after mine consumption also the quality of the final effluent is
monitored with the use of relevant indian standards

 the treated water is being supplied to the local villages after mine consumption quality of the final
 effluent is monitored in terms of the relevant indian standards
    domestic effluent treatment plant detp the domestic effluent from major residential colonies
     is treated in detp either by activated sludge method or by extended aerated lagoons
    mine discharge treatment plants mdtp are installed in mines for treatment of mine water
     strata seepage water in mines first gets accumulated in the mine sump which provides for initial
     settlement of suspended particles the supernatant water from the sump is then pumped out on
     surface and treated in surface sedimentation tank which provides for second stage settlement
     the treated mine water is then used partly within the mine premises for dust suppression
     firefighting plantation washing and further treated as per drinking water standard for supply to
     company township and nearby villages through pressure filter  ro etc after ensuring maximum
     reuse within and around mine premises the excess treated mine pumped out water is released
     onto local nalla  streams which is used by the surrounding local population especially for
     agricultural use
    in order to assess the impact of mining activities on ground water quarterly monitoring of ground
     water levels is being carried out in and around the coal mines covering the buffer zone ie10
     kms radius further recharging of ground water is also taken up within mine premises as well
     as in nearby villages through rainwater harvesting digging of pondsdevelopment of lagoons de
     silting of existing pondstanks etc
    regular monitoring of mine effluent workshop effluent and domestic effluent is carried out
     every fortnight as per environment protection rule  2006 reports of the same are regularly
     submitted to spcbs and moef

              zero discharge of the effluent

              good environment management practices have made cil and its subsidiary units a zero discharge
              effluent treatment facilities for mine effluent workshop effluent and chp effluent like oil  grease
              traps sedimentation ponds and facilities for storage of treated water and its reuse have been provided
              for all the major projects

              as of now cil is operating 15 coal washeries with a capacity 3680 mt  all of which have been
              designed for zero discharge the total washed coal production from these existing washeries for the
              year 201617 has been pegged at 1704 million tonnes with the help of state of the art technology in
              the field of coal beneficiation that will create and aggregate throughput capacity of 12368 mty cil
              plans to up the performance in its 22 new washeries the storm water drainage will be treated in
              settling ponds before being discharged into rivers streams and other water bodies the wet washeries
              generally utilise mine water as a rule in case mine water is not available the option of storage of rain
              water and its use is being practiced with rainwater harvesting the use of surface water and ground
              water is being diligently avoided to the maximum possible extent

biodiversity
cil has created value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining the biodiversity
value is retained with no significant affected water bodies or related habitat action plans were taken
to identify legally protected and high biodiversity value areas when conducting assessments identified
by international union for conservation of nature iucn and the united nations environment
programme world conservation monitoring centre

if not managed properly mining can impact the biodiversity in an adverse manner with broad ranging
implications that affect habitat conversion as well as water and soil contamination at cil we
recognize the importance of the biodiversity which bears maximum impact due to our operations we
strive to mitigate the impact through our ethical practices it is our firm belief that in order to sustain
our business we need to take up tasks for the restoration of our environment so that development
takes place on both sides in a responsible manner our good practices involve a gamut of activities
which have been undertaken for managing our natural capital these protected areas are out of
bounds from mining activities areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas are being
maintained with regular gap plantation with indigenous species we follow the eia and emp of the
moefcc for keeping track of biodiversity assessments

steps to retain biodiversity

       meeting expectation on biodiversity assessment
       preventing any impact on biodiversity and conducted appropriate assessment for future
       setting up biodiversity baseline to providing foundation
       no mine exploration in conserved or world heritage sites
       land restoration and rehabilitation

coal india has made afforestation over the area of around 37557458hectares through wellstructured
environmental management plans and sustainable activities as part of clean  green programme
massive plantation has been taken up by cil wherever land is available

waste management
waste is something that can generate a number of problems in social and environmental terms and
needs to be managed in a way that creates sustainable growth for the surroundings at cil we are
acquainted with the fact that mining generates a lot of waste due to its operations which has a direct
impact on the environment this is because mining involves removing the top layer of the earth to dig
out coal once the coal has been extracted various kinds of wastes such as solid waste mine water
removed top soil process waste suspended air particulate matter instrumental waste oil spills
tailings sludge etc which through proper channel should be neutralized or dumped for minimal
impact of environment



                                                                                             62  p a g e

we recognize that careful management of mine waste is very important to ensure sustainability of the
operations we undertake safe disposal of waste even as we keep the effect on local communities in
mind hazardous materials used oil and explosives are managed appropriately and the same is
reflected in our environmental audit statement that are submitted to the central pollution control
board and state pollution control board in form v etc no coal spillage and oil spillage were reported
during the reporting yearcil has an agreement with third party for proper disposal of hazardous
waste and the responsibility of its subsidiaries through the state government ensures no human or
environmental impact

land reclamation
reclamation of mined out areas is important for sustainable development emphasis was laid on
proper reclamation both technical and biological and mine closure satellite surveillance for land
reclamation was given the requisite thrust by partnering with the national remote sensing centre at
hyderabad satellite surveillance has been introduced at all the open cast mined in order to monitor
the land reclamation activities of the mining sites this has been done in order to comply with the
moef stipulations as well as for progressive mine closure monitoring

land restoration  reclamation monitoring of 50 opencast coal mines projects of cil producing more
than 5 million cum coalob based on satellite data for the year 201617

one of the most important and primary resources used in mining includes land therefore our major
sustainability measures are aligned towards taking mitigation measures for reclamation of mined out
areas and the external ob dumps reclamation of mined out areas is conducted as per the
environmental management plan approved by moef where back filling of the ob material in the mine
voids is part of the mining operation cycle for all the new mines part of our initiative includes top soil
preservation storage and the use in plantation areas within the reclaimed locations in the open cast
mines also concurrent reclamation and rehabilitation of the mined out areas are taken on as a matter
of priority for gainful use of land this is done so that the geo mining conditions and the technical
feasibility does not suffer the overburden extracted during the coal extraction process is also filled
into the open cast mines after technical reclamation thereafter complete plantation is carried out in
a process that is termed as biological reclamation

accordingly we have engaged the forest research institute fri dehradun and top soil has been
recognised as an invaluable natural resource this has been done especially for regeneration of the
regional ecology with measures ranging from effective bioreclamation of disturbed land for this
scientific studies have been conducted in order to select suitable species of plants for each coalfield
with a sustainable sequence of reclamation from grass to shrubs and trees the forest research
institute has been engaged by us to gain a partner whose rich expertise in the field of ecorestoration
can help in the reclaimed areas




                                                                                              63  p a g e

monitoring of land reclamation of oc mines through remote sensing

cil introduced stateofthe
art satellite surveillance to
monitor land reclamation and
restoration for all opencast
projects      the        land
reclamation                and
rehabilitation operations are
being monitored by satellite
surveillance 50 major ocps
excavating more than 5 mm³
coalob per annum are
being monitored every year
while     remaining      ocps
excavating less than 5 mm³
coalob per annum are being monitored every 3rd year this gives a clear picture of reclamation
which otherwise is difficult to accurately estimate the study during 201617 shows that all the major
ocps excavating  5 mm³ coalob per annum have reclaimed area of 7759 and active mining
area is only 2241 of the total excavated area in addition cil is conducting vegetation cover
mapping through satellite surveillance in every 3 years



case study ecological restoration
as a part of ecorestoration measures the suitable selection of plants for each of the coal fields is
done in a way that will give rise to a sustainable sequence of reclamation from grass to shrubs and
finally into trees this helps in creating a basis for effective bioreclamation of disturbed land with the
help of scientific followed for the selection
the forest research institute fri has been engaged by us for providing their services for eco
restoration in the reclaimed areas where top soil has been recognised as an invaluable natural
resource

cil has always fostered and cultivated a culture to achieve greener footprint and nurtured
afforestation in various mines some of the ecopark in reclaimed land eco parks have been
developed in many of the mined out areas of cil

       gunjan park of ecl
        ananya vatika of secl
        nigahi of ncl
        saoner of wcl

noise reduction

noise pollution in open cast mines has an adverse impact on humans and wild habitat there is a need
to reduce or abate the noise due to mining practices and transportation of mined product through
better mining techniques and a proper channel for flow of mined product from mines to various
locations our operations involve the use of hemms for mining blasting and drilling which can
contribute greatly to noise pollution this is an occupation hazard that we are aware of  one that
impacts the workers busy within the coal mines for our operations to be environmentally friendly
we at cil have taken several measures to control noise pollution

apart from proper maintenance of equipment to minimise vibrations we have also indulged in
developing a green belt which is wrapped around the mine as well as residential areas this green
cover helps in combating noise additionally we have also taken on controlled blasting and blasting

                                                                                       65  p a g e

only during the day time the use of technically sound machinery such as surface miners continuous
miners and high wall miners are used for extracting coal without the blasting process in addition we
are always committed towards providing occupation health and safety facilities to workers working in
the mine accordingly ear muffs and ear plugs have become a part of the regular gear to be used by
workers in noisy areas


noise has decreased by introduction of new technologies at cil like

       proper maintenance of equipment to minimize vibration
       green belt provided around the mine as well as residential area
       longwall method
       shortwall method
       blasting gallery technology
       highwall mining
       continuous miner technology resulting in increased percentage of extraction in
        undergroundug mining
       controlled blasting  blasting in only day time
       surface miners continuous miner  high wall mining which extract coal without blasting
       ear muff or ear plugs provided to workers at highly noisy areas

mine rehabilitation and reclamation
    projects on sustainable mine closure activities and mining wasteland to be utilized as a source
       of livelihood for local community were proposed to be carried out with the help of us
       agencies in this regard a proposal was received from ms norwest corporation on 15 th dec
       2015
    after many deliberations on the proposal it was proposed by cmpdi to route the proposal
       through indous cwg platform prior to submission at the rd nodal agency ie cmpdi for

       forward the same to ms norwest corporation vide email dated 28th november 2016 for
       incorporating their input in the annexures before submission of the proposal

mine closure plan mcp

mine closure plan is an integral part of the project report prepared by cmpdil for coalmines this
progressive mine closure plan also forms a part of the eiaemp prepared and submitted to moef for
environmental clearance the progressive reclamation of mined out areas by inbuilt in the project
cost and is implemented accordingly after exhaustion of reserves statutory obligations in respect of
closure are also followed cil is practicing mine closure very effectively cil is committed for
restoration of abandoned  mined out areas in a socially acceptable  environment friendly manner
as on march 2017 out of 454 identified mines 453 mcp were already prepared 445 mcp were
