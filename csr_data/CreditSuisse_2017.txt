credit suisse materiality assessment
we aim to focus our activities on topics that are relevant to
our business as well as to our stakeholders our materiality
assessment helps us gain a better understanding of
different perspectives identify key issues and report on
them transparently it is based on our ongoing dialogue
with stakeholders see page 8
      credit suisse periodically conducts a materiality
assessment to help ensure that the list of material issues
identified in the past remains relevant and that important
new topics are addressed having performed a materiality
assessment by conducting stakeholder consultations in
previous years we reviewed this list in 2016 in a three
step process that included the identification prioritization
and review of material issues based on the results of this
analysis we updated and adjusted our materiality assess
ment for 2016 new issues were identified and included
while the importance assigned to some of the issues iden
tified previously has changed
      when performing this assessment we relied on infor
mation from monitoring tools and on the views of internal
experts who participate in an ongoing dialogue with
relevant stakeholder groups this allowed us to take into
account the views of investors clients employees sustain
ability rating agencies nongovernmental organizations
ngos political decisionmakers and the media
      the materiality assessment is not an exhaustive list of
the topics raised during the process instead it focuses
on those issues that we believe are of greatest importance
to a majority of our stakeholder groups and to the long
term business success of credit suisse
      the findings of the materiality assessment form the
basis for the inclusion of individual aspects of corporate
responsibility in our reporting and their adjustment over
time we plan to continue our efforts to identify relevant
issues in the future in order to proactively determine new
challenges and their significance for our stakeholders and
our business the materiality assessment is also available
