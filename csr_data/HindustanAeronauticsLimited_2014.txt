                       efciency in our operations and design our approach is to continuously improve energy efciency in all our
                       divisions we use both direct and indirect energy the direct energy used in our operations includes furnace oil

                       the electricity purchased from the local electricity board forms the indirect energy consumption at hal

hal in its endeavour to conserve energy has carried                water
out an energy audit in fy 2012  13 at all major units of
its bangalore complex the audit was undertaken to                 we understand the importance of water and its
evaluate existing energy consumption levels and to                 resource in the local context water will be a critical
identify the scope for energy efciency                            factor for future sustainable growth especially for a
improvements hal has already initiated efforts to                 fast developing country like india with declining
reduce the energy consumption and to improve the                   water availability in our areas of operation we see
operational efciency of the major areas by                        water conservation as a serious sustainability

helicopter division at bangalore have undertaken                   water at several divisions we recycle and reuse the
several energy saving programs which has resulted                 process water and rain water after treatment at our
in a cumulative energy savings of 206563 units and               facilities this water is ultimately used for irrigating

further keeping the commitment towards playing a                   recycled and reused from our divisions in 201213
role in the energy security of india we have taken                as already said this mainly included water
initiatives to generate power from renewable source               recovered from process and from rain water after
we have assessed the feasibility of settingup a 5 mw              treatment this is primarily achieved from the
wind power plant in the state of karnataka through                divisions at bangalore hyderabad and lucknow
the feasibility study conducted we have shortlisted

organic waste

the organic waste generated within the hal campus
is eminently suited to biogas production in short
what we would have disposed off is converted to a
valuable source of energy at hal we have installed a
biogas plant of capacity 500 kg per day wherein the
organic waste is treated through anaerobic digestion
process the total biogas produced from the project
activity is 423 m3 which is majorly used for cooking
purpose thus displacing the lpg usage equivalent to
19035 kgs or same as 1321 cylinders of 144 kg
capacity further steps are already underway to
implement one more biogas plant of capacity 1000
kg per day

ewaste disposal

ewaste at hal is basically the used electronics
devices like computers printers etc ewaste
contains rare and precious metals that require
specic technologies to extract and rene them
these materials are recovered and processed into
secondary materials in the recycling process thus
displacing the production of virgin materials thereby
resulting in energy savings and greenhouse gas
                                                                                 bio gas plant
