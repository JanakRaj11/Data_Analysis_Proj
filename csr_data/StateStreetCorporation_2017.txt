strategic role of corporate responsibility




letter from joseph l hooley chairman and ceo

being a responsible citizen is a vital part of who we are and what we stand for as an organization were proud of
the steps were taking to conduct our business in a responsible manner that benefits all our stakeholders

this report details the significant progress we made toward our corporate responsibility cr goals in 2016 and
discusses the programs and initiatives were pursuing to increase our positive impact


creating a culture of risk excellence

we know that earning the confidence and trust of our stakeholders is essential to our continued success we work
diligently to hold ourselves to the highest standards of integrity and governance while recognizing that this is a
process of continuous improvement over the past five years weve taken significant steps to strengthen our risk
assessment and monitoring capabilities as well as our controls and governance  with the goal of making risk
excellence a competitive strength and point of pride for us weve increased our annual investment in compliance
audit and risk management and adopted a comprehensive compliance framework across the company weve also
more than doubled the size of our compliance staff over the past five years and made risk management part of
each employees annual performance ratings

in 2016 we enhanced our standard of conduct training that all employees must complete annually we
implemented a program to actively encourage employees to speak up if they see something that doesnt seem
right and to challenge decisions irrespective of their role or level within our organization we also partnered with
the international business ethics institute to conduct a series of workshops to train senior leaders on how to
foster the right environment to help employees feel comfortable challenging decisions or expressing their
concerns


investing in esg

building on more than 30 years of experience in environmental social and governance esg investing globally
state street global advisors our asset management business expanded its range of esg products in 2016 one
notable highlight was the launch of a proprietary gender diversity index along with an etf to track it the spdr
ssga gender diversity etf comprises the stock listings of large us companies with the highest levels of women in
leadership positions relative to other firms in their sector its designed to allow investors to invest in companies




                                                                                      corporate responsibility         4

with gender diverse leadership  and use their capital to influence company behavior and promote efforts to
increase gender diversity in corporate america

state street global exchange our data and analytics business also launched an esg solutions business to apply
quantitative analytics capabilities to help clients identify and mitigate exposure to esgrelated risks this cross
functional team collaborates with other groups across the company to support the development of esgrelated
products and services to help clients manage risk and generate alpha


environmental sustainability

more than three years ago we set a series of goals to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and water usage by
20 percent per person and to divert 90 percent of waste sent to landfills by 2020 compared to a 2012 baseline im
pleased that we met or surpassed these goals in 2016 three years ahead of our original target our success reflects
greater employee involvement in environmental initiatives all across our company enhanced energy efficiency and
recycling at our facilities and reduced commuting times due to flexible work arrangements to name just a few

were building on our momentum by committing to new sciencebased targets to reduce our global greenhouse
emissions by another 30 percent by 2025 we invested in a number of projects during the year to offset carbon
emissions from our operations and business travel including the purchase of renewable energy certificates
recs to completely offset our north american electricity use we also invested 418 million in renewable energy
projects including residential and utility solar and wind programs


strengthening our communities

living up to our responsibility as a good corporate citizen means supporting the communities in which we operate
our employees are incredibly generous about giving back and during 2016 more than onefifth of them
participated in companysponsored volunteer activities and donated more than 120000 hours of their time to
charitable causes in addition our state street foundation provided 196 million to nonprofit organizations
around the world including matching employee contributions to 2229 charitable organizations

we focus our charitable efforts on education and workforce development because we believe that providing
disadvantaged individuals with the education and skills they need to build careers is vitally important one initiative
that im especially proud of is boston workforce investment network boston wins a fouryear 20 million effort
launched by our foundation in 2015 in partnership with five nonprofit organizations working to advance job
readiness and create meaningful career pathways for boston youth boston wins made great strides in 2016
providing key college and career readiness services to seniors in 20 boston public high schools we also made
substantial progress toward our fouryear goal of expanding the reach of the five partner groups by 60 percent
and our commitment to hire 1000 boston youth who have worked with one or more of our boston wins partners


diversity and inclusion

drawing on a variety of ideas and perspectives from across our global workforce makes us stronger and helps us
develop a more engaged workforce a more inclusive and innovative culture and better business results in 2015
we established specific targets to increase the diversity of our leadership ranks by the end of 2017 and were
making good progress toward achieving these goals weve implemented measures to address potential barriers
in our selection promotion and talent development processes such as providing unconscious bias training to our




                                                                                       corporate responsibility        5

recruiting professionals building out a global diversity sourcing team and requiring a diverse slate of candidates
for all openings at seniorlevel positions we know from past experience that improving the diversity of our
workforce requires commitment from the top so measuring progress on diversity and inclusion is now a key part
of our annual performance reviews for all managers


sustainable development

as a signatory since 2014 to the united nations un global compact we turned our attention in 2016 to the 17 un
sustainable development goals aimed at addressing important esg challenges after a careful assessment we
chose to focus our efforts on several of the goals that most closely align with our cr priorities such as education
economic growth gender equality affordable clean energy and climate action we continue to make progress in
addressing these longerterm goals but realize we have much more to do to play our part in helping realize these
global priorities by 2030


always finding better ways

2017 marks our 225th anniversary  specifically the founding in 1792 of our oldest predecessor company union
bank to serve the thriving maritime trade in boston as our business has grown and evolved over the years one
constant has been our commitment to corporate responsibility we dont pretend to have all the answers when it
comes to cr but were committed to always finding better ways to conduct our business responsibly and serve
our stakeholders well were working hard every day to live up to that challenge




                                                                                     corporate responsibility         6

letter from rick lacaille chairman of the executive corporate responsibility committee

rick lacaille is global chief investment officer cio of state street global advisors ssga and an executive vice
president of state street corporation he became chairman of our executive corporate responsibility cr committee in
june 2016

as one of the largest investment managers in the world we continually focus on how companies manage the
potential impacts of environmental social and governance issues on their businesses we know that those issues
over the long term can have a material impact on a companys ability to grow recruit and retain good talent
benefit the broader community and generate the attractive returns we seek for our clients that perspective
reinforces our own commitment to corporate responsibility at state street as we look to manage those same
issues for all of our stakeholders


managing our impact

our focus on responsibility and sustainability continues to inform our efforts on behalf of our clients employees
and shareholders in 2016 we made great strides on several fronts we created a proprietary gender diversity
index and an etf that tracks it to enable investors to leverage the growing evidence that companies with higher
degrees of gender diversity in their senior ranks perform better we developed our environmental sustainability
employees network esen marked the 40th anniversary of the state street foundations ongoing contributions
to the broader community and included modern slavery issues in our supplier assessments in addition we were
proud to achieve our environmental 2020 goals three years ahead of schedule reducing our carbon impact by
33 percent water usage by 21 percent and reaching a diversion from landfills of 90 percent we also continued to
strengthen our ethics and compliance strategies


spreading awareness

every year we recognize the importance of maintaining our reputation externally and internally this requires that
we hold ourselves as a business to the highest compliance and sustainability standards and communicate
effectively about what we are achieving  especially regarding corporate responsibility as chairman of the cr
committee one of my top priorities is to make our progress known inside and outside state street especially as
our clients particularly millennials increasingly focus on esg and cr


committed to the long term

but we know there is far more work to do were taking a longterm view and developing strategies to achieve
sciencebased targets for greenhouse gas emissions these are targets consistent with limiting global warming to
two degrees celsius the threshold at which many of the most harmful impacts of climate change can be averted




                                                                                     corporate responsibility        7

were also evaluating how best to contribute to the united nations sustainable development goals a longterm
effort to support international development in meaningful ways were committed to strengthening our culture of
risk excellence and thoughtful employee engagement finally well continue to research esg issues and create
new esg capabilities that will drive wider awareness and adoption of sustainable business models

when thinking about whats on the horizon we need to make sure that our activities reflect the complexity of our
impacts we have more than 30000 employees and offices in 30 countries and in our defined contribution
business alone we manage the retirement savings of more than 13 million people in other words we have an
enormous responsibility to our stakeholders and were excited to rise to this challenge to manage our impacts
the right way we need to make cr a priority and spread awareness on what were doing were committed to the
long term




2016 cr goals and progress
each year the executive cr committee develops goals that are not only material to state street but also promote
new esg opportunities our 2016 goals were




                                                                                    corporate responsibility        8

material corporate responsibility topics

every two years we conduct a materiality assessment that aligns with the principles and guidelines of the global
reporting initiative gri this exercise allows us to prioritize the most relevant cr issues for our business and
stakeholders

our most recent materiality assessment was conducted in 2015 with support from sustainserv incgmbh a cr
consultancy we began with a list of 32 potential cr topics compiled from gri the iso 26000 guidance on social
responsibility the sustainability accounting standards board sasb and cr reports of other financial services
companies to narrow this list we considered whether the topic presented significant risks or opportunities to
state street if it related to our core values and the extent to which it would impact our stakeholders interests we
plan to reassess material issues in the reporting year 2017


gathering input from our stakeholders

to crystalize the vision of our cr program we asked colleagues across business units and regions to provide
feedback on potential topics via an online survey to assess the topics in a holistic manner the survey also looked
at relevant impacts that could occur in our value chain participants from north america europe middle east and
africa emea and asia pacific apac operations weighed in on the relevance of each issue to state streets
business success we then refined this input at an inperson workshop in boston and online workshops in emea
and apac

we also invited a select group of clients investors suppliers nongovernmental organizations ngos and
academics to complete the online survey which we supplemented with followup interviews to make sure the list
of topics also met the expectations of our external stakeholders


strategically meaningful materiality

the chart on the following page shows the 15 focus topics that are currently most relevant to our company and
stakeholders it also lists the topics that fell outside of the materiality scope while were focusing on the most
relevant topics in this report well continue to manage other topics appropriately and reassess their relevance for
future reports

we decided that some topics were not material on their own but contribute to our performance on material topics
examples include the impact of energy efficiency business travel and commuting on our greenhouse gas
emissions and the impact of human rights policies and training on our responsible sourcing well conduct a
materiality assessment later this year to ensure our report continues to represent a wellbalanced and broad suite
of sustainability topics




                                                                                      corporate responsibility       9

materiality and the way ahead
inspired by the guiding principles of the integrated reporting framework published by the international integrated
reporting council iirc our 2016 cr report continues our effort to describe how material cr topics support our
strategic goals to fully capture the complex connections between responsibility and business we describe the
primary impacts of cr topics to our strategy as well as secondary but still meaningful impacts the results are
clear all parts of our corporate strategy can be supported by our attention to relevant cr topics

    material cr topics             primary impact   about the way ahead
       compliance and                               the way ahead is our strategy

risk excellence

while risk is an intrinsic element of work in the financial services sector how we manage it can help differentiate
our company from the competition we address risk management through a companywide compliance risk
management framework crmf that sets forth the roles and responsibilities of our board of directors and
management regarding this important issue

risk is best managed at the point where it originates however to complement that our management process
adds two layers of defense that together provide guidance and structure for identifying assessing controlling
monitoring and reporting compliance risk

our three lines of defense are

    1   first line every employee owns and manages risk and is responsible for their own internal control
         environment
    2   second line enterprise risk management and corporate compliance staff establishes and monitors
         adherence to the crmf
    3   third line corporate audit provides independent assurance of the process identifies improvement
         opportunities and suggests further action

in 2016 these risk assessment processes were used to identify and manage compliance risks throughout the
company in general we analyze 100 percent of our global business for risks related to corruption


updating guidance

complementing the crmf in 2016 we updated our global antibribery and corruption abac policy and modified
our gift and entertainment policy we also significantly enhanced our procedures for thirdparty relationship
management mergers and acquisitions and risk controls for hiring clientconnected persons

as an indication of the seriousness with which we take compliance weve made policy breaches and employee
conduct matters a direct factor in performance measurement and assessment processes for all employees in
cases of the most serious compliance breaches or repeated breaches compliancerelated issues automatically
override other elements of an individuals performance and place a limit on that individuals performance rating
and incentive compensation in 2016 employee sanctions included counseling and retraining reduction in
incentive compensation limitations on posting for positions and penalties up to and including termination in the
most serious cases


training programs

in 2016 all state street employees globally received training in anticorruption policies and procedures all
employees are required to complete the following training every year

        standard of conduct
        political activities
        antibribery and corruption awareness




                                                                                    corporate responsibility         11

       corporate information security and privacy
       conflict of interest
       insider trading
       fraud awareness
       global antimoney laundering and sanctions programs

the state street standard of conduct to which every employee is required to certify refers to our global anti
bribery and corruption policy completion of the training and certification to the policy is tracked and is subject to
the state street compliance enforcement procedure which establishes a standard global framework for the
enforcement of all requirements established by the policies to further improve our compliance performance in
2016 we partnered with an external organization and developed a speak uplisten up program which was
delivered to 61 executive vice presidents by year end this program which will be rolled out further in 2017
includes casebased inperson training on the most effective ways to develop stronger cultures of speaking up
within organizations a whistleblower hotline is just one mechanism by which employees can feel comfortable
speaking up


compliance and business ethics

in 2017 were celebrating state streets 225th anniversary our longevity as a financial institution is due in part to
the trust weve earned with our clients shareholders employees and communities to maintain this trust we
must continuously and vigilantly monitor adherence to the standard of conduct which outlines the expectations
we have for our employees our standard of conduct was updated in 2016 to include elements related to oversight
of contingent workers whistleblower protection and the prohibition on use of mobile devices on trading floors it
also explains the core concept of ethics including an ethical decisionmaking framework that helps guide
employees decisionmaking when there is not a prescriptive rule for the situation at hand


compliance governance

we manage our compliance and risk assessment programs primarily through the work of three committees the
management risk and capital committee the business conduct risk committee and the technology and
operational risk committee these three committees are supported at the board of directors level by the risk
committee and the examining and audit committee this structure provides comprehensive oversight to the wide
range of issues related to risk compliance and ethics




                                                                                       corporate responsibility       12

addressing reputational issues

in 2016 we achieved closure on two pending legal matters related to certain areas of our business we take any
issue that affects our reputation very seriously weve addressed these matters headon appropriately resolved
them and taken measures to ensure that similar issues are avoided in the future

       indirect foreign exchange  in december 2016 we announced settlement agreements to resolve all
        pending litigation and regulatory matters in the united states connected to alleged insufficient disclosures
        in our indirect foreign exchange fx business the total amounts paid in these settlements were
        575 million see page 34 of our 2016 form 10k for further details these claims date back to early 2009
        its important to note that starting in 2009 we significantly strengthened our client disclosures around
        indirect foreign exchange and we believe that we now have the most comprehensive disclosures in the
        industry
       pension fund servicing  during the year we entered into a settlement with the us securities and
        exchange commission related to alleged improper solicitation of business with the state of ohio pension
        plan addressing this issue internally included eliminating the use of consultants in the selection of public
        fund mandates




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      13

our compliance culture

we spoke with cuan coulter executive vice president and chief
compliance officer about our compliance culture and how it has
evolved

q how long have you been at state street and what does being a
responsible company mean to you
ive been at state street for nine years when i joined the company      cuan coulter is responsible for state
                                                                         streets compliance oversight
in 2008 we were coping with the turmoil of the financial crisis like
                                                                         program he leads a global team involved
many other large banking institutions the whole world was               in assessing regulatory risk
changing i knew i was going to have a lot to do to serve as a           implementing policies designed to
catalyst for culture change its been a dynamic and stimulating         mitigate that risk and performing
                                                                         monitoring to assess how well we are
environment ever since  which makes it both challenging and
                                                                         meeting our regulatory requirements
incredibly fulfilling

as a compliance officer responsibility doesnt just mean whether
were complying with laws which we make sure to adhere to but
that were acting as stewards of the public good this includes
making sure our clients assets are safely kept and shareholder
interests are also taken into account

q what are state streets first second and third lines of defense
risk is best managed at the point of its inception if youre the one
making decisions from the getgo then you should be the one
thats the most aware of risks associated with your decisions and
the best ways to manage these risks so all employees making
decisions are our first line of defense

second lines of defense have two roles theyre advisors that
educate the first line of defense about risk management matters
and how to think about these matters they also have a monitoring
responsibility to assess whether the first line of defense is adhering
to agreed risk tolerances

third lines of defense are independent and remain removed from
the decisionmaking process they try to identify situations where
our actions are contrary to our stated control objectives and risk
appetites




                                                                                  corporate responsibility      14

the goal is to have a control infrastructure that collectively prevents and detects excessive risk taking the three
lines of defense should act in concert to reduce residual risk to acceptable levels

q what cultural shifts needed to occur to develop a strong compliance culture how is state street supporting
and reinforcing it
our culture is very collaborative with multifaceted decisionmaking processes because were so collaborative
individuals are less likely to play devils advocate our hierarchical structure tends to aid organizational
alignment but on the margin it also inhibits provocative advice especially from subordinates in the long term
complex problem solving requires active challenge and debate weve already seen how this leads to better
decisionmaking so were continuing to encourage employees to speak up

we are building out a strong first line of defense and are encouraging our employees to think critically and
practice a healthy dose of professional skepticism were continuing to instill a culture of compliance  which will
take time  but so far our efforts are proving successful

q aside from the collaborative and hierarchical structure of state street what are other challenges with
creating a strong compliance culture
an important way for state street to thrive in the long term is to fundamentally change how we develop products
and solutions this goes for how we operate as well which is why we need to be open to creativity and innovation
wherever they arise

this means that at the top we want our leaders to listen to everyone they work with  regardless of whos the
expert in the room from the bottom up were empowering our employees to share ideas and thoughts

one approach includes creating problemsolving groups where our employees are challenged to be the
provocative voice in a hypothetical situation this allows them to feel comfortable with speaking out in a controlled
lowstakes setting this also helps break up the hierarchy in decisionmaking our speak up training which
includes similar group practices and hypothetical scenarios is continuing to roll out across our organization

ultimately we dont want to fall into the trap of saying that risk gets dealt with by only certain people we need
everyone to be aware of risk and comply with risk management at every step of our processes




                                                                                       corporate responsibility       15

creating value for clients and shareholders
the very core of our success lies in our relationships with our clients and shareholders to make sure were
offering the very best solutions to our clients existing and emerging challenges we rely on continual and open
dialogue in response to client feedback we customize our solutions products and services to best meet their
needs such as offering financial products that embed environmental social and governance commitments
likewise weve learned that when our shareholders understand our goals and our plans and progress toward
achieving them they continue to support our strategies

with approximately 2877 trillion in assets under custody and administration and approximately 247 trillion of
assets under management as of december 31 2016 we prioritize acting prudently and responsibly through our
position at the center of the worlds financial markets


client experience and feedback
measuring satisfaction and loyalty

measuring the quality of our clients experience gives us a glimpse into their loyalty and the depth of our longterm
business relationships to strengthen these relationships we provide clients with frequent opportunities to
articulate their needs and suggest ways we can improve these include client experience and satisfaction surveys
as well as regular feedback gathered from clientfacing teams we use this insight to inform our longterm
approach to delivering greater value


gaining insight

to provide further insight into our client relationships in 2014 we introduced a new approach to collecting and
acting upon client feedback based on the net promoter score methodology nps during the initial nps survey
pilot phase in 2014 we included 13 of our largest global asset management clients who we support through our
global relationship management grm team the nps survey addresses three areas commercial conditions
state street as an organization and our service quality most importantly it asks if the client  based on their
experience working with us  would be willing to act as an advocate for our company

in 2016 we increased the number of participants from 13 to 35 top clients and we expect to reach our top 60
clients in 2017 year after year were experiencing greater response rates and more than 600 individuals
responded from 35 of the top clients we surveyed in 2016 so far weve also seen scores improve incrementally as
clients provide positive feedback in each new round of surveys received were continuing to expand our survey
respondents and as we do so were learning more about our clients needs and perceptions our goal is to not
only build on our relationships with these clients but to also strategically and tactically dive deeper in selective
audiences to gain a thoughtful perception of customer satisfaction and loyalty moving forward the nps system
will essentially become the primary lever we use to evaluate client experience




 this aum reflects approx 3062 billion as of december 31 2016 with respect to which state street global markets llc ssgm

serves as marketing agent ssgm and state street global advisors are affiliated




                                                                                               corporate responsibility              16

from satisfied clients to loyal advocates

after receiving client feedback our goal is to transition from short
term satisfaction to longterm advocacy to achieve this we must
create an environment of high accountability when it comes to
acting on client feedback to make sure were continuously
providing value to clients we conduct a formal review with each of
our 35 top clients where a range of topics is discussed and action       andy muncer
plans are agreed upon engaging in this dialogue helps us better         senior vice president head of
understand what our clients expect and value most and in turn           marketing and client experience
allows us to build lasting relationships
                                                                         it is our goal to maintain open
                                                                         communication with our clients at the
by doing this we built a structured framework that has already
                                                                         end of the day we want them to receive
shown increases in our overall nps scores and overall number of          positive returns  but we also want to
promoters and that enables us to identify what we need to focus on      ensure that their feedback is heard and
to further increase our clients loyalty by improving their              addressed well continue to keep a
experience                                                              pulse on their needs and satisfaction
                                                                         through our nps surveys well also
                                                                         keep an eye out for opportunities to
driving value through thought leadership
                                                                         bring our clients greater satisfaction
thought leadership about our industry plays a critical role in how
we provide value to our clients we conduct targeted research to
provide our clients with strategic insight into issues shaping the
future of the investment industry

we carefully consider which topics may be most helpful and
interesting to investors worldwide for example we develop
resources on industry challenges and trends that help our clients
deepen their understanding of the markets when a client
expresses interest in a particular subject we can connect them
with industry professionals to share best practices as an example
were starting to receive more interest in human rights issues as a
result were incorporating a human rights component in our
request for proposal rfp process see pages 4546 for more
information we also share best practices on topics such as
product development regulation and technology with our clients




                                                                                 corporate responsibility      17

ethical marketing and fair competition

to enjoy the trust of our clients we must always act fairly and ethically in all aspects of our business our
employees must always represent our values in their interactions with clients peers the companies we invest in
and even our competitors there are also regulations that we must comply with regarding how we represent our
products and how we compete for business

upholding these principles  and complying with all applicable laws regarding fair competition and how we
represent our products to our clients  is nonnegotiable the global standard of conduct that all employees
must abide by clearly prohibits misrepresenting any material facts and requires that they understand and uphold
the laws regarding crossselling and bundling of products and services

in 2016 our compliance and ethical marketing systems reflected our dedication to ethical marketing and fair
competition as we did not have any instances of noncompliance with regulations or our policies regarding
marketing communications global marketing was 100 percent compliant with all corporate compliance related
requirements which include all compliance trainings and annual reviewmanagement of global data privacy
controls similarly there were no legal actions taken against state street specifically in response to anti
competitive behavior antitrust issues or monopolistic practices in 2016 we have also successfully managed the
2016 compliance program requirements and implemented foundational elements for the development of our
compliance program in 2017


marketing ethically

state street global marketing and business unit marketing compliance teams work together to ensure that
marketing materials and programs comply with all internal policies and applicable regulations

we also developed a compliance oversight program for global marketing to assist in managing regulatory risk a
global marketing training module is under development and is currently slated for delivery in mid2017 to align
with the development of our compliance program


upholding fair competition

a key tool for maintaining our clients trust is the standard of conduct which clearly prohibits all employees from
engaging in any unfair competitive actions failing to disclose conflicts of interest or misusing a clients
confidential information employees must complete annual training and certification of the standard of conduct
which similarly outlines conflicts of interest and employee reporting requirements

we also strictly prohibit our employees from giving or receiving anything of value in exchange for or the perception
of a specific business advantage we have strict annual territoryspecific limits for gifts given to an individual and
any gift or entertainment offered to a public employee or us union official requires prior approval through our
star compliance platform we train employees across the company to make sure they clearly understand their
responsibility when entertaining clients or prospects




                                                                                     corporate responsibility       18

data protection and privacy

our clients rely on us to provide them with tools that help them make the best investment decisions our tools
help them analyze large volumes of data identify trends measure fund performance and benchmark against the
industry this requires that we safeguard sensitive information in our care our comprehensive information
security and customer privacy programs help instill confidence and build trust between state street and our
clients


secure and accessible data

accurate data classification is required as part of our standard of conduct and is essential in fullfilling our
commitments to both clients and regulators we follow strict protocols when classifying client data to ensure
proper handling from its creation through its entire life cycle

in 2016 we deployed a software tool to help enforce classification of our information assets at the point of
creation this tool requires emails and most common usercreated documents to be marked with one of six
classifications  highly confidential personal sensitive data confidential limited access company internal or
general information must be appropriately labeled distributed stored and disposed of according to its
classification

building on this platform weve also evaluated a tool that helps manage access encryption and revocation
internally and externally shows the movement of data when operational this data protection tool will be fully
integrated with our classification tool by reading embedded tags the tool can enforce policy according to our data
classification protocols

protecting information from external threats

we operate a dedicated data loss protection program that includes technical tools and business processes to
monitor for and mitigate against any data leakage examples include tools to prevent endpoint data loss web
proxy controls file transfer protocol ftp monitoring and internet usage monitoring in 2016 we formalized a
corporate data loss protection strategy that will enable us to standardize and streamline these programs
companywide we did not receive any substantiated complaints with respect to our customer privacy programs
during the reporting year

a key achievement in 2016 was the enterprisewide deployment of endpoint protection software which provides
threat detection and analysis of activity on endpoint devices such as desktops laptops and virtual desktops we
also implemented a shadow it identification program to detect and analyze the communication of data to external
sites to further control unsanctioned activity and data exfiltration building on this were developing a formal
program to introduce additional data leakage prevention technologies and processes across the enterprise




                                                                                      corporate responsibility      19

esg products and the gender diversity etf
we offer a variety of esg products and solutions to learn more about
these we sat down with two of our executives from state street global
services and state street global advisors to discuss esg and our
gender diversity etf

                                                                            jessica donohue

their esg analytics challenges for years weve offered leading
                                                                            founded and was global head of the

traditional esgrelated risks as well                                     including investable indices and
                                                                            advisory solutions
take governance as an example how can a portfolio manager
quantify the level of diversity be it gender or ethnic diversity within
a companys management ranks another example is climate
change what will happen to the portfolio if global temperatures
rise above a particular threshold it takes a portfolio manager
10 seconds to pull up a companys pricetoearnings ratio but esg
risks are much harder to identify and as researchers discover
more and more links between esg factors and financial impact
they will only become more important these are the kinds of
challenges were seeking to solve

q how do passion intuition communication and collaboration
play a part in esg data analysis
donohue were recognizing the passion in the younger
generation  the millennials they want to make a difference in the
world and theyre also our future clients esg gets at that passion
and our goal is to make a case for why esg is important to our
clients and how it will increasingly become more important as time
goes on even the less passionate cant ignore esg because it has a
potentially longterm impact on their portfolios we need to help




                                                                                     corporate responsibility      24

our clients embrace the opportunities and prepare for the risks that
may come with pursuing or not pursuing esg in the future we
see esg becoming an integral component of the financial analytics
toolkit if its anything like risk management  which has come a
long way in the decade since the global financial crisis  then esg
could be embedded into analytics much sooner than we think
                                                                           lynn blake

2017 publication date sheds light on the link between esg factors         manages fiduciary transactions and
and financial performance weve found that academics ability to          company stock investments
think outside of the box is critical to helping us build a bestinclass
esg offering at state street

q in 2016 state street launched the spdr ssga gender diversity
index exchange traded fund what was the rationale for the etf
blake in 2015 we started thinking about how we could address the
gender gap in corporate america from an investment standpoint
we wanted to be able to put direct capital to work by investing in
companies that had achieved strong levels of gender diversity
among the senior ranks

the etf is benchmarked to our proprietary ssga gender diversity
index which includes listed us large capitalization companies that
have the highest levels of senior leadership gender diversity within
their sectors this is a unique strategy in the marketplace as there
arent many transparent lowcost funds that choose investments
through a gender lens what makes it even more unique however




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      25

is she impacts a percent of the revenue from the etf will be donated to organizations and programs that
inspire and equip girls and young women to be future business leaders  particularly in industries where women
have low representation today such as stem science technology engineering and math we want to enhance
the likelihood that women will thrive in the corporate world and the gender diversity etf can help

q why is diversity in corporate leadership good for economic upside
blake research has shown that higher gender diversity leads to better performance for example a global study
conducted by msci between 2009 and 2015 found that companies with at least three female board members
outperformed others in overall return on equity by more than 36 percent

many other research institutions have found similar results in fact research has shown that greater diversity
leads to more diverse opinions which leads to better decisionmaking and ultimately translates to better
profitability corporate performance and share price according to a study conducted by msci companies with
higher gender diversity also have fewer ethical issues were looking at diversity as an esg opportunity that makes
a strong business case with positive longterm results

q how does the gender diversity etf fit into state streets overall strategy
blake esg is an important initiative at state street as one of the worlds largest asset managers we use our
voice and our vote to engage companies on issues that impact longterm value creation which include many esg
themes increasingly our clients want to align their investments with their esg views the gender diversity etf is
an example of this trend and in order to continue to help our clients we need to create innovative products that
meet their esg and investment goals another example of an impact investing etf is the msci acwi low carbon
target index ticker lowc which overweights companies that have low carbon emissions there are a lot of
directions we can go in including thinking about the intersection of factor investing and esg were of course very
excited about gender diversity etf but also overall about the future of esg investing

as the etf sponsor state street cant be included in the gender diversity index companies within the financial
sector that are included tend to be smaller however as a large bank we believe were quite similar in our
diversity when compared to other large banks we think that the etf will continue to drive our own internal
commitment to corporate responsibility including diversity and externally it encourages companies to commit to
their own corporate responsibility and diversity goals

q what do you hope for the gender diversity etf over time
blake the launch of our gender diversity etf coincided with international womens day  march 8 2016 we
took advantage of that date to communicate our commitment to diversity and its importance in corporate america
and around the world ultimately we want the gender diversity index to be the standard by which companies
benchmark themselves and for membership to be an important milestone in their diversity goals we also hope to
develop other gender diversity indices beyond large us companies where the diversity gap is even more acute its
a journey and we look forward to a future where all companies achieve equality and the need for the gender
diversity index becomes moot




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      26

asset stewardship

ssga is primarily a passive asset manager representing nearpermanent capital  in other words as long as a
company is included in a particular index it remains in the portfolio as a result we believe passive managers
have a clear responsibility to be longterm asset stewards for their clients their management also affects the
overall health of companies stakeholders and economies around the world so they are an important piece of the
financial puzzle in 2016 more than 19 trillion was invested into global passive funds


shareholder engagement with portfolio companies

ssga screens companies in client portfolios against a range of issues that could impact performance over time
for example esg factors can impact the reputation of a company and create significant operational risks and
costs therefore welldeveloped corporate social responsibility programs that manage these factors can generate
efficiencies enhance productivity and mitigate risk

stakeholders have noted that screening for esg factors is particularly important for us public sector clients and
those in the european nordic regions and australia in apac esg transparency and careful screening are also
increasingly becoming more important

2016 esg client engagements




                         fy 2014                       fy 2015                      fy 2016

our screening focuses on thematic areas that help us stay on top of whats trending with our clients what theyre
interested in and what risks and opportunities they face some of these areas include

       esg financial topics
       board leadership
       environmental sustainability topics eg climate change water energy consumption
       social responsibility topics eg diversity education and other community investment programs

moving forward we plan to continue looking at sectors that are resourceintensive such as oil and gas mining
and other extractive industries for diversity screens we plan to start looking more at compensation diversity of
female representation and minority disclosures keeping a careful eye out for gaps in information through our
thematic screens helps us maintain a continuous dialogue with companies while also enhancing transparency




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      27

our stakeholders expect us to provide transparent tools for screening investments  including environmental and
social factors these tools include

          environmental and social screens
          identification of companies that our asset stewardship team should engage with for environmental and
           social issues
          governance screens
          examination of overall independence of a board and rights afforded to shareholders
          tenure screens
          identification of companies that we want to engage with to discuss esg issues

these tools help us actively identify companies for shareholder engagement and enhance oversight of risk at
portfolio companies in 2016 we continued our engagement with investment companies ceos and board chairs to
make sure that shareholder interests are addressed by the board

our esg engagement efforts also included meetings with 611 global companies representing more than
32 percent of our total assets 12114 in portfolio


sector deep dives

ssga develops a series of strategic priorities that drive our engagement with portfolio companies every year
these are based on developing macroeconomic conditions emerging esg trends and client feedback a significant
challenge for all passive index managers who are invested in thousands of listed companies globally is to provide
active oversight of each company to deal with this we take sector deep dives for all major industry sectors every
four years covering a total of 60 sectors sector deep dives help us proactively monitor and engage companies on
matters such as longterm strategy performance and esg issues in 2016 ssgas stewardship priorities included
a sector focus on automobiles global banks and it

reviewing global holdings within a sector lets us identify business and esg trends impacting our holdings and
puts us in a stronger position to advise boards and management teams when they seek feedback or direction from
large institutional investors we also share our insights with clients through presentations and report our findings
in our annual stewardship report

economic performance

to create value for our shareholders were focused on generating consistent revenue growth and maintaining
disciplined expenses the economic success of our business also determines our ability to serve all stakeholders
with this in mind we manage the risks inherent in our business with systems procedures and oversight to
maintain transparency and longterm sustainability


revenue slightly impacted by processing fee decrease

our total revenue in 2016 decreased slightly compared to 2015 this was primarily due to a decrease in processing
fees and other revenue partially offset by increases in management fee revenue and securities finance revenue

servicing and management fees collectively made up approximately 78 percent of total fee revenue the
remainder was attributed to trading services securities finance and processing and other fees servicing fee
revenue decreased by 2 percent compared to 2015 primarily due to lower global equity markets partially offset by
stronger net new business management fee revenue increased by 10 percent compared to 2015 primarily due to
the impact of the acquired ge asset management geam business and the elimination of money market fee
waivers partially offset by lower global equity markets


flat expenses from counterbalancing effects

total expenses in 2016 were relatively flat compared to 2015 primarily driven by increases in compensation and
employee benefits information systems and communications and restructuring costs largely offset by decreases
in professional services expenses securities processing costs and lower litigationrelated expenses costs
associated with the acquired geam business contributed to the increase in compensation and employee benefits

to realign and adjust our workforce and whenever possible will use separations such as planned retirements and
reductions via attrition as appropriate to help meet our staffing needs

readiness and create meaningful career paths for boston youth please see pages 5256 for more information on
boston wins we had great success within the first year of our partnership hiring more than 200 new employees

professional skills we provide a host of training and development opportunities that help employees deepen their

as employees rise into leadership roles we help them sharpen skills and develop qualities that are essential for
success in our leadership development program ldp established in 2015 we offer a robust management and
leadership curricula for assistant vice presidentlevel employees virtually and around the globe the mission of
the ldp is to accelerate the development of highpotential midcareer employees who demonstrate the skills and

72 percent retention rate since inception involves multiple job rotations and provides handson experience in

success our employees undergo a performance planning and review ppr process to ensure that performance
objectives and career development goals are set collaboratively with their managers in 2016 over 97 percent of
our employees participated in midyear and yearend progress reviews

function participate in our annual talent review process to enhance capabilities across our company the 2016

wage equity and flexible work options

equal opportunity

weve taken strong stands for public policy initiatives such as equal pay for women marriage equality and safety
for transgender people in 2013 we signed the boston womens compact and were executing its objectives in
several ways by setting organizational goals for diversity by mentoring women in leadership roles by engaging
them in our employee networks and through our flexible work initiatives

as a global company and one of the largest employers in massachusetts were committed to providing an
inclusive and supportive work environment within our walls and beyond in 2013 we joined 277 other employers
from across the country to sign an amicus brief to advise the us supreme court of the defense of marriage acts
doma harmful impact on american employers additionally we supported a bipartisan campaign that led to the
passage of the transgender antidiscrimination bill in massachusetts in 2016




                                                                                     corporate responsibility      33

upholding wage equity

the ratio of wages of our female employees compared to our male employees in the company is material to our
business and of interest to our stakeholders in fact many clients ask us about our nondiscrimination policies as
part of the new business request proposal process and several us states have or are considering regulation
around gender pay equity however we do not report the percentage of female base salary compared to male base
salary a simple acrosstheboard analysis of an organization of state streets size and multiple businessline
complexity would not accurately compare similar positions or capture all elements of a total compensation
program

providing total value

recognizing that quality service begins with quality employees we focus on the total value of our pay packages
ie salary benefits and incentive compensation to attract and retain key personnel we allocate compensation
based on yearly performance assessments at the corporate business unit and individual level and differentiate
pay by individual to reward our highest performers for their contributions were also committed to adhering to
local laws regarding the freedom of association and collective employee action and have not identified any
operations in which this right may be at signficant risk

in general all employees receive benefits a fixedbase salary and are eligible for an annual incentive award
depending on the job level a portion of annual incentives may be awarded in equity to further align our employees
interests with those of our clients and shareholders we also offer sales incentive plans and recognition awards to
certain employee populations

attracting and retaining the best employees means we need to compensate for talent in a manner that is
consistent with our peers compensation is an important way to reward employees for outstanding performance
and incent them to stay at state street over other options weve invested in tools and research that can provide
managers with pay practice data at the individual employee level this is especially useful in our talent
development strategy and in encouraging topperforming employees to grow their careers at state street

an open door policy

we have not identified any operations in which the right to exercise freedom of association and collective
bargaining may be at significant risk were committed to adherence to local laws regarding the freedom of
association and collective employee action our standard of conduct emphasizes our commitment to foster a
culture where all employees feel valued engaged and respected we operate our offices with an open door
policy and encourage employees to engage openly with management and staff across all levels employees also
have the opportunity to participate in global networking events to facilitate communication and idea generation and
we open these events to peer and client organizations to further facilitate engagement and freedoms of expression
and association

flexible work

we believe that offering flexibility in how when and where work gets done increases employee engagement and
productivity flex work may include a consolidated schedule or a change in work location while job share
opportunities allow more than one employee to share a position on an ongoing basis




                                                                                   corporate responsibility         34

benefits from a flexible work arrangement can include enhanced worklife balance and time and cost savings
from commuting the flex work program is baked into our business strategy and has become a proactive
managerinitiated program supported by tools technologies and resources

our flexible work employee network a group of employees who voluntarily work together to champion our formal
flex work program also contributes to our efforts in expanding the program for example the network provides
career development guidance and support to flex community followers to help them in career advancement
internal mobility and becoming an advocate in their area


productivity through balance

supporting our employees health and worklife balance also helps our employees succeed our global wellbeing
program bewell offers tools and resources that encourage employees to proactively manage their total well
being by focusing on three core pillars physical emotional and financial health

while we view physical health as critically important we also realize that supporting emotional and financial
health is equally vital in meeting the needs of a diverse and multigenerational workforce bewells objective is to
create a healthier workforce increase employee morale and enhance continued employee engagement


bewell engagement

globe participated in our first global bewell steps challenge we look forward to rolling out even more bewell
programs and competitions


active participation and professional growth

along with health and wellness we view professional growth as an important part of our employees prosperity to
support this we developed a college coach program as part of our worklife benefits in our us offices the
college coach program provides assistance to employees with all aspects of the college selection application and




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      35

finance processes the program also consists of live workplacewebinar events ondemand resources and
personalized assistance  all at no cost to our employees

state street is built on a foundation of talent culture innovation and risk excellence in order for that foundation to
be strong our employees must be healthy and engaged professionally and personally  and compensated
appropriately for their efforts healthy and engaged employees are more productive which is good for them and
for our business


diversity and inclusion
embodying a diverse inclusive workforce

research shows that a diverse workforce is an asset to any business as a global company we know that building
a team with a variety of backgrounds experiences and perspectives helps drive new ideas create connections and
enhance performance  all of which lead to a stronger bottom line the power of our people is one of the factors
that set state street apart from our competitors thats why promoting both our employees differences along with
traits that we all share are important components of cultivating our diverse organization we work hard to provide
an inclusive environment where all employees feel valued respected and supported and we remain committed to
building on that diversity

we do not tolerate discrimination or harassment on the basis of an employees race color religion creed
national origin ancestry ethnicity age disability genetic information sex sexual orientation gender gender
identity citizenship marital status domestic partnership or civil union status familial status military and veteran
status or other characteristics protected by applicable laws


benchmarking our diversity

measuring and reporting on our progress keeps us on track as we strive to foster an increasingly diverse and
inclusive culture and workforce it starts with setting strong goals in 2014 we established clear targets to
advance the diversity of our leadership ranks by the end of 2017 these include

       boosting female representation at the assistant vice president avp level from 405 percent at the end of
        2014 to 43 percent at the end of 2017 and at the senior vice president and above svp level from
        242 percent to 28 percent respectively
       in our us operations raising the percentage of employees of color at the avp level from 267 percent to
        30 percent and the svp representation from 92 percent in 2014 to 13 percent by 2017 respectively

in addition the impact of our diversity and inclusion efforts can be quantitatively measured through our company
wide employee engagement survey our employees who either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement my
company encourages and promotes diversity of backgrounds talents and perspective are significantly more
engaged than those who do not concur with that statement with nearly 80 percent of our employees in agreement
with this statement and only 5 percent disagreeing our diversity and inclusion efforts are clearly having a
significant impact this score is also significantly higher than the financial services benchmark




                                                                                       corporate responsibility       36

meetings are run in departments companywide encouraging open dialogue around topics and questions that
trend over time our executives also regularly blog on our internal social networking site about issues related to
our organization and our business strategy to which staff can add their feedback and comments  and these often
lead to rich proactive discussions

dedicated leadership

demonstrated commitment from our executives is critical to our diversity and inclusion efforts in 2016 our

500 million and 220 million in north america emea and apac respectively on thirdparty supplier services in
2016 this added up to about 332 billion globally including financial it business and professional services and
market data travel management and office support

in north america 80 percent of our spend is with 78 suppliers and 80 percent of emea spend is with 77 suppliers
our procurement team works tirelessly to identify highquality costeffective flexible suppliers that help us
operate and serve our clients efficiently

tools that will help us reach our spending and risk management objectives supply chain categories that
procurement focuses on for key products and services include

identifying our suppliers

our procurement team also sets procurement standards identifies suitable suppliers and negotiates favorable
price and contract terms this is typically achieved through an initial request for proposal rfp process all rfps
issued by procurement include a section for questions related to environmental aspects human rights fair labor
practices and legal proceedings against the organization or its officers

respondents are requested to answer all questions which allows us to evaluate new suppliers for environmental
certifications workforce welfare ethical sourcing practices employment practices and anticorruption guidelines
are currently being developed to engage with suppliers who are found to be lacking in one or more of these
important areas we dont calculate the percentage of suppliers that were screened specifically for environmental
human rights labor practice criteria and impacts on society however all standard rfps and master service
agreements msas indicate state streets expectations for compliance and performance regarding these topics

by including this evaluation language in our rfps were also able to understand vendors perspectives and
policies on these subjects for example in 2016 we expanded the promoting workforce welfare series of
questions in our rfps to include specific language to rate compliance with the uk modern slavery act of 2015 on
top of that all master service agreements for new and renewing vendors now require written compliance of the
uk modern slavery act of 2015 adding these elements to our rfps and msas also signals to our suppliers that we
care about these issues


engaging suppliers

we seek to partner with highquality suppliers who share our values and commitment to client service and
responsible business practices since we have a large supplier base the suppliers we select have an impact on
local economies our supply chain workforce environmental protection and broader social issues

our vendor selection process considers ethical business practices impacts on local economies environmental
stewardship and broader social issues as part of this commitment we choose to work with suppliers who offer
products and services that will reduce our overall environmental footprint as part of our environmentally
preferable purchasing program eppp whenever possible in cases where an ecofriendly solution is costlier
however we manage tradeoffs between environmental and economic goals


local sourcing

we use local suppliers whenever we can to meet our needs if our global business needs limit our options for local
sourcing we encourage our larger global suppliers to use local secondtier vendors if they can were continuing
to explore more ways to include local sourcing questions in procurements rfp process in addition we plan to
monitor the secondtier vendors our larger suppliers use were confident that continued development and
implementation of these key initiatives will continue to drive better business unit engagement and enhance the
selection of compliant and responsible vendors

were also exploring how local sourcing and our supplier diversity program  which measures and encourages
sourcing from businesses owned by minorities veterans and women  can support each other




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      43

furthering our supplier assessments

were enhancing our purchasing tools to ensure suppliers comply with our risk assessment protocols including
thirdparty risk management tprm and antibribery and corruption screening abac a mandatory no
purchase order po no pay policy is scheduled to launch in 2017 this will greatly improve our ability to manage
vendors

well continue to channel all services and goods vendors through our procurement teams environmental and
social assessments for now were committed to loading all new and existing vendors into a contract repository
and supplier hub to better screen for key program compliance this also coincides with our p2p initiative allowing
procurement to remain familiar with all onboarded vendors in our supplier hub in turn that helps us make
strategic decisions when advising our business units to use approved or existing vendors that meet our business
needs and desire for responsible vendor partners were also focused on screening all emea vendors for abac
and uk modern slavery compliance this greatly enhances our ability to understand potential human rights issues
amongst our vendors in emea


supplier screening

all requests for proposals issued by global procurement services gps include a section for questions related to
human rights respondents are requested to answer all questions which allows us to evaluate new suppliers for
workforce welfare and ethical sourcing practices we do not calculate the percentage of exisiting suppliers that
are screened specifically for human rights criteria




                                                                                  corporate responsibility      44

corporations we spoke with lauren savage and brian downer to
learn more about our commitment to human rights and how we
remain vigilant with our suppliers

find this extremely disturbing and it is rewarding to play a part   state streets behalf on a global basis

in our risk applications




                                                                            corporate responsibility       45

savage we pay particular attention to any products or services delivered out of the five highestrisk countries for
modern slavery  india china pakistan bangladesh and uzbekistan we address other countries but we keep a
careful eye out for those five additionally there are highrisk industries relating to the services we procure that
we also keep tabs on since it equipment is a backbone of our work we look into our suppliers of those products
too

by taking all of this information into consideration during our vendor assessments were ensuring state streets
commitment to partnering with quality compliant suppliers on top of this we are going to train and educate our
procurement and global human resources hr teams so that they look out for any human rights issues in their
work


q do you believe state street employees andor clients support the initiatives you have taken or plan on taking
downer there is interest from all of our clients and employees in the decisions we make we need to make sure
we protect our clients from risk  including procurement risk weve received inquiries from clients regarding the
uk modern slavery legislation for example and weve assured them that were taking action in our procurement
processes for this new legislation were currently developing our statement and protocols and expect to have a
statement on our website by june of 2017 our clients also perform due diligence on us against a broad set of
topics and they relate to environmental sustainability and human rights these issues do not feel like a fad 
theyre a permanent way were doing business

issues like human rights  so were making sure were impacting our community and the planet in positive ways
were doing what we can to put our money where our mouth is through various philanthropy and environmental
commitments as a result weve developed a culture based on the principles of environmental sustainability and
engaging in the neighborhoods where we work and live




                                                                                      corporate responsibility          46

supporting communities and the environment
supporting our communities

while providing value for our clients is one of our top priorities active engagement in our local communities is one
of our fundamental values in fact its an integral part of our culture through volunteerism employee
engagement programs and our grantmaking charitable arm the state street foundation weve supported the
communities in which we operate for over 40 years in addition by using our resources  both human and
financial  to protect the environment were not only supporting our communities but also reducing costs and
attracting and retaining clients and employees who share these priorities

since 2014 weve also been a signatory to the united nations global compact  a global initiative uniting
organizations to help build prosperous societies see the table on pages 6567 for a description of our
commitment

wealth and income creation in society
responsible impact in the global economy

our greatest responsibility is to connect our clients with the right opportunities to do this we evaluate both
established and emerging markets for growth potential for example e7 a group of seven emerging economies
is projected to have close to 50 percent of global banking assets by 2050 despite holding less than 20 percent in
2013 through global expansion and further integration of our products and services were ready to meet the
demand driven by the industrys globalization

our approach to responsible investment management is exemplified in how we service our pension fund clients
who are responsible for safeguarding the retirement assets of people all over the world to continue delivering
value to these clients we provide comprehensive longterm investment management solutions for their pensions
these options not only better the lives of those receiving pensions they strengthen the prosperity of financial
networks

supporting wealth and communities

we believe investing is a powerful tool for example as of december 31 2016 we currently hold 766 million in
lowincome housing tax credit investments these investments provide equity to developers of lowincome
housing and economic benefits that reach far beyond the individuals and families that receive housing

we also recognize the opportunity to support communities through designated open space for example in 2016
we acquired 40 acres of undeveloped land in san diego county california due to a loan enforcement process this
land was surrounded on three sides by a california state preserve and we decided to donate it to the preserve via
the nature conservancy this decision aligned with our goal of supporting prosperity in local communities and we
look forward to seeing this recreational land benefit the community and the health of the surrounding ecosystem

acknowledging our efforts

as a result of our efforts and commitment to strengthening communities we received an outstanding
community reinvestment act cra rating from both the federal reserve bank and the massachusetts division of
banks our last outstanding rating awarded after the 2015 cra exam was our seventh consecutive rating at the




                                                                                    corporate responsibility       47

highest level these exams look at all the ways we meet community development needs where we operate with a
special focus on our headquarters region


strengthening communities and the workforce
creating local jobs

we prioritize creating sustainable local impact beyond our normal business operations as we have more than
30000 employees in our operations around the globe we provide substantial job opportunities in the communities
where we live and work new job opportunities in any of our global offices are always advertised locally first for
example 100 percent of senior management positions were filled locally in 2014 and 89 percent in 2015 in 2016
our commitment continued as 97 percent or 30 of 31 new hires at our seniorlevel were filled by local
candidates these seniorlevel candidates included senior vice presidents and above

we also rely on our university relations team partners who work with undergraduate and graduate schools in the
greater boston kansas city new york new jersey sacramento and atlanta areas to recruit the best and
brightest for jobs in those locations our summer internship program professional development program and
future focus programs also fill our local talent pipeline in addition in singapore we recently began hiring 50
nanyang polytechnic students annually for sixmonth professional programs for academic credit and in ireland
we launched a new apprenticeship program in partnership with the national college of ireland the first
apprenticeship group will begin their work at state street in 2017 our boston wins project see pages 5254 also
creates local job opportunities


engaging employees and encouraging philanthropy

our employees engagement with meaningful projects and volunteer opportunities is also evidence of our
commitment to corporate responsibility for example in our offices around the world community support
program committees csps made up of local employees assist with community engagement activities including
grantmaking volunteerism and event sponsorship our corporate citizenship team trains funds and supports
these committees and each csp is given flexibility to adapt the programs they support to best serve local needs

we also encourage our employees to engage with ongoing projects theyre passionate about our giving investing
and volunteering by employees give initiative is focused on choice giving employees a stronger voice in how they
can play a part in our collective effort to deepen the impact of state street in the community

thanks to our generous employee base 76 percent of our overall operations participate in local community
engagement projects impact assessments and development programs we also encourage our executives to
connect with charitable boards in their local communities

boston wins or boston workforce investment network is a fouryear 20 million initiative seeking to accelerate
our impact on education and workforce development across the city of boston led by the state street foundation
boston wins brings together five highperforming nonprofits  boston private industry council pic bottom
line college advising corps uaspire and year up  each of which has the ultimate goal of advancing college and
career readiness to improve the scale and reach of these organizations the boston wins network requires
significant coordination of efforts referred to as coordinated action

boston wins has identified three key services critical to helping high school students graduate and prepare for
college their career or both

    1   college knowledge and admissions advising
    2   college affordability and financial aid advising
    3   work experience and career awareness

this is where coordinated action comes into play coordinated action enables the boston wins network to deliver
these services in a complementary reinforcing and effectively sequenced manner with the goal of connecting all
youth to the resources they need to be successful in and graduate from high school as well as ensuring readiness
for college and their careers with increased communication a consistent reporting system and a designated set
of desired student outcomes boston wins network partners can track what services students have received
identify and address gaps and facilitate referrals to the other partners theyre also able to connect youth with
support for the transition between high school and postsecondary plans to maintain momentum in their
education and career pathways

three primary commitments drive boston wins

measuring our environmental impact

in addition to enhancing our communities social wellbeing protecting and maintaining the health of our planet is
a top priority to achieve this we set targets and track our environmental performance to reduce our impact and
advance our environmental strategies

for example in 2013 we committed to decreasing our greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 20 percent per person
by 2020 compared to a 2012 baseline through our commitment to this goal we achieved a 33 percent reduction
in ghg emissions by the end of 2016 we also exceeded our goal of 20 percent water reduction per person by 2020
reducing water use per person by 21 percent last year on top of that we met our landfill diversion goal achieving
a 90 percent diversion rate reaching our target of 90 percent diversion from landfill by 2020

comments in 2016 scope 3 emissions for prior years have been restated to include grid loss

the primary source of our ghg emissions is the energy we use in our operations as a result this is where we
focused our efficiency efforts while pursuing new ways to mitigate and reduce emissions


operational energy efficiency

monitoring energy efficiency in our offices through certification or accreditation programs also keeps our
environmental targets on track for example our office in bangalore india is gold certified under the indian green
building council igbc our offices in dublin republic of ireland london england and edinburgh scotland are
accredited iso 50001 a global energy management standard and our gdansk poland office is certified leed
platinum

in 2016 our channel center office in boston massachusetts was awarded leed gold certification and our office
in quincy massachusetts has continued to receive the energy star certification and maintained a leed eb silver
certification the josiah quincy building received energy star certification for the first time in 2016 to maintain
our commitment to reducing our ghg emissions and environmental impact we also use sustainable materials
and led lighting in our operations wherever possible as we continue to grow and inhabit new work spaces we
seek buildings and opportunities that increase our energy efficiency




                                                                                              corporate responsibility   56

flexible work solutions

our environmental data shows that employee commuting and business travel are our secondlargest source of
ghg emissions as a result we encourage sustainable commuting options and flexible work solutions that reduce
commuting for example state street is a member of a better citys transportation management association
which is aimed at enhancing sustainable solutions for transportation in boston in addition were partnered with
hubway which provides employees the opportunity to rent bicycles for their daily commutes we believe that
offering our employees the flexibility to work in alternative locations empowers them to perform autonomously
and responsibly while simultaneously reducing our impact on the planet

at our location in kraków poland we are also piloting a concept called max pack this new concept offers fewer
work stations than staff given that through travel holidays and general absences weve demonstrated that our
employees are never all onsite at the same time thus were able to run our office at over capacity max pack
which reduces our environmental footprint not only through fewer work stations but also through reducing the
total physical space occupied by consolidating work stations onto one floor of our buildings rather than multiple
floors


a continued focus

while our past benchmark revolved around reducing ghg emissions per person our current strategy is to set
sciencebased targets for global ghg emission reductions please see next page while we reviewed our success
in reaching our targets we discovered that increasing the number of employees in our buildings was just one
element required to achieve the greatest reductions in environmental impact

in addition to capacity weve chosen to also incorporate the following optimizing operational equipment
efficiencies employee flexible work options vetting new lighting and controls technologies and expanding
employee involvement in our environmental initiatives in fact as we expand into new offices we look for buildings
that are highly energy efficient were also continuing to focus on retrofitting our current offices with innovative
technology were prioritizing data center virtualization and we unplug unused zombie servers wherever
possible to avoid producing unnecessary emissions as it requirements grow


carbon offset and renewable energy certificate rec investments

in 2016 we invested in a number of projects to offset carbon emissions from our operations and business travel
for example we purchased carbon offsets from a ugandabased cook stove project and we purchased enough
renewable energy certificates recs to cover our north american electricity load these recs were sourced
predominantly from the midwest although a small purchase of massachusetts wind power was also made

in 2017 we also plan to use solar power for common area lighting and thermal power in the building of our new
office in hyderabad india well continue to look out for future opportunities to reduce our environmental impact
across all of our global offices




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      57

sciencebased targets
we spoke with sharon donovanhart about sciencebased targets and
our commitment to taking on this exciting new energy and greenhouse
gas ghg emissions endeavor

q what are sciencebased targets and why did state street
decide to add them to its environmental program
                                                                          sharon donovanhart
sciencebased targets sbts are focused on reducing corporate            executive vice president enterprise
ghg emissions in order to limit global warming to less than 2c           business services at state street
compared to preindustrial temperatures after cop21 the 2015
                                                                          sharon donovanhart leads the
united nations climate change conference held in paris france           development and execution of multiyear
many companies pledged to implement sbts and simultaneously             transformation programs in
these kinds of commitments grew in importance to our clients             conjunction with global realty
                                                                          procurement continuity and third
shareholders and employees we recognize the opportunity and
                                                                          party risk management
impact sbts have so we decided to align our corporate ghg
reduction goals with global emissions budgets

q what are state streets sciencebased targets and what
impact will they have on the bottom line
our commitment to sbts began in 2016 and our targets were
reviewed by the sciencebased targets initiative our goal is a
30 percent global reduction in ghg emissions by 2025 measured
per square meter and were already on track to achieve this its a
global target so all of our operations will help us achieve this goal
weve already begun working with our building managers and
landlords on the operational efficiencies of our buildings to achieve
our objectives and were using 2015 as our baseline our
employees are also very interested in and aware of these efforts so
were engaging with them to create strategies that contribute to our
sbts of course were also still turning over a lot of rocks in the
corporate sense to find more opportunities to reduce our
emissions




                                                                                  corporate responsibility       58

for some of our ghg emissions initiatives the business case is cost neutral but once we validate the details of all
the programs and targets there may be some cost impacts the fact is were committed to this for the long run
were thinking of our targets as a program  because programs are ongoing and targets once achieved are
finite well fund sbt programs the way wed fund a property to keep it uptodate well use costbenefit analysis
and careful planning to choose the best options in technologies and equipment but were going to continue
marching toward our sbt goal


q why is it important for state street to have such a forwardlooking environmental approach
we dont think of sbts as an event but a way we do business we dont want this to be the next big fad we want it
to be an impactful commitment were considering environmental impact reduction in everything we do within our
operations because doing so is important to us society and the planet however although were honing in on
reducing our emissions well continue to focus on reducing the amount of water we consume and the waste we
produce our environmental and sbt programs will be dynamic but enduring


q what do you hope state streets commitments to sbts will achieve in the long term aside from reducing

impacts of climate change
risk excellence and environmental challenges

we take environmental risk management very seriously in all aspects of our business and increasingly as it
relates to environmental challenges to manage this risk we developed an environmental risk excellence matrix
that evaluates strategic market regulatory reputational and physical risks while climate change isnt an
immediate risk for our operations we identified certain risks and mitigation strategies primarily involving strategic
and reputational risk were diligently monitoring and evaluating these and other risks we identified

overseeing our risk

our state street global advisors ssga stewardship group introduced a climate change risk oversight framework
for directors in 2016 this global program encompasses all equities we manage and helps us plan for any possible
risks we may face as a result of climate change we also built a multifactor risk analytics engine that uses esg
nonfinancial factors to identify potential esg risks for our custodial clients

risks from climate change

we regularly evaluate the physical risks of climate change in the context of our activities this typically includes an
assessment of frequency and severity of major weather events and the potential impact this could have on our
operations the possible impacts we evaluate include

    1 the potential loss of or temporarily restricted access to buildings or operations
    2 the loss of or damage to technology and operations infrastructure
    3 business operations or technology impacts to employees as a result of severe weather

the potential financial risks associated with the physical implications of climate change include costs from
weatherinduced damage supply chain disruptions or inability to provide products or services our current
approach to business continuity now includes consideration of environmental risks related to climate change

we also assess the vulnerability of new locations to potential climate change effects since many of our major
buildings are in coastal areas as part of our environmental management system our environmental
sustainability committee also continues to evaluate and calculate costs associated with our environmental
sustainability programs were committed to protecting our clients from any service interruptions including those
related to climate change in addition to taking responsibility for mitigating our own climate impacts

committing to risk management

as a signatory to the united nations global compact were committed to a precautionary approach to
environmental challenges our iso 140001 certification at 17 of our largest operations across the globe also
requires us to evaluate environmental risk over the long term at the end of the day we view our commitment to
environmental sustainability and ghg emission reductions as a means of continuously acknowledging and
addressing any possible risks associated with climate change

recognized opportunities

environmental sustainability themed products and services reveals the opportunities associated with
environmental challenges we recognize this kind of stakeholder interest as a potential area for generating

united nations un sustainable development goals




as a signatory to the un global compact see page 65 in 2016 state street adopted five un sustainable
development goals as part of our approach to corporate responsibility after reviewing all 17 sustainable
development goals the executive cr committee selected five that not only align closely with our overall strategy
but also create the greatest value for our business and stakeholders

       ensure inclusion and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning
       promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth employment and decent work for all
       achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
       ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all
       take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact

to communicate the purpose of each goal and steps taken to achieve them weve grouped these five goals under
themes of workforce development gender equity and environmental sustainability

quality education decent work and economic growth

in 2016 state street took major steps to ensure that the communities in which we operate were provided
resources to further quality education decent work and economic growth to promote quality education around
the world state street volunteers devoted more than 10000 hours to mentoring and serving hundreds of youth

in addition to our work toward achieving quality education for all we also took action to promote sustainable
economic growth employment and decent work for all we succeeded in this by providing internships and
opportunities to youth as a means to develop skills and promote social mobility all while enhancing company
performance the boston wins program and its partnership organizations supported more than 200 internships in
2016 this immense progress is most visibly reflected in wins successful placement of nearly 25 percent of state
streets total commitment to 1000 new hires

gender equality

on the gender equality front 2016 was a busy and rewarding year for state street with regard to the gender
diversity targets we set forth in the beginning of the year we achieved three of our four target areas including at
the evp svpmd and vp levels similarly as a member of the boston womens workforce council we remained
committed to the principles outlined in the bostons 100 talent compact




                                                                                     corporate responsibility       63

most notably ssga launched a gender diversity etf in march 2016 see page 25 for more information on the
gender diversity etf the launch coincided with international womens day in accordance with executive support
and market research this product delivers a tailored brand strategy that drives progress toward clear gender
disaggregated key performance indicators

affordable and clean energy

weve made great strides with regard to our environmental goals by focusing our attention on clean energy and
climate initiatives we hit and even exceeded our 2020 goals to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and water usage
by 20 percent and divert 90 percent of waste from landfills in addition to the goals we set forth we integrated
climate risk into our investment analysis strategy for example 22 of ssgas products are esg portfolios with five
specific to environmental issues

over the past few years ssga has also developed several products to address climate change including green
bonds lowcarbon and fossil fuelfree etfs among others please see page 20 for more information on our
esg products and solutions lastly state street took steps to accelerate the transition to an inclusive lowcarbon
economy through carbon offset purchases and our participation in a renewable energy tax credit investment
program through this program we invested more than 400 million in renewable energy projects in 2016




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      64

the limitations of our assurance engagement
for the economic performance data disclosed in the report we have restricted our work to checking the
consistency of those data with the audited state street annual report on form 10k for the year ending
december 31 2016 we have not assured the personal views expressed in the letters and interviews included in
the report the reliability of the assured data is subject to inherent uncertainties given the available methods for
determining calculating or estimating the underlying information
our conclusions
based on our activities nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the information in the selected sections
of state street corporate responsibility report 2016 as described under scope above is not fairly presented in
all material respects with the reporting criteria
our observations
we have provided state street with a separate detailed management report without affecting the conclusions
presented above we have the following key observations
     wage equity is a material topic for state street however the company does not currently report the
       percentage of female base salary compared to male base salary we encourage state street to review its
       reporting to assess whether information on this key topic of interest to stakeholders can be disclosed in
       future cr reporting
     in 2016 state street has adopted five of the 17 un sustainable development goals sdgs which are most
       closely aligned with its overall strategy we recommend that state street identifies specific targets within
       those five sdgs to which it believes it can contribute and works to align its programs and activities with
       those targets to enable reporting on progress in relation to the sdgs in future reports
