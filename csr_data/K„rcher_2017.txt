           dear
           readers


               hartmut jenner chief executive officer and chairman of the management board


           do you know an honourable merchant this term has unfortu
           nately fallen into disuse however its guiding principle is still
           valid today because the respectability of a medieval merchant
           comprised virtues that never go out of fashion virtues such
           as a love of peace and tolerance integrity and reliability and
           quality and responsibility

           today these keywords would be subsumed under the category
           of corporate social responsibility for kärcher as a family busi
           ness this has naturally always been a matter of course the
           result of our sustainabilityoriented strategy has been that in
           2015 kärcher experienced the highest turnover in the compa
           nys 80year history with 222 billion euros in revenues and
           approximately 13 million machines sold

responsibility
for nature culture
and society

what distinguishes a company that claims to
be a good corporate citizen is it the support of
cultural initiatives environmental protection
donations of money or donations in kind for
those in need we believe that being a good
corporate citizen means taking responsibility
we want to make the world liveable for as many
people as possible

for us as manufacturers of cleaning equipment
that primarily means contributing to a cleaner
environment through the economical use of re
sources such as raw materials energy and water
as well as through challenging cleaning projects
at humanitys cultural heritage sites our idea of
creating a liveable society also includes helping
people who are in need due to natural disasters

recycling system cleans 75000 m3 of reclaimed water from product tests every year
but kärcher are committed to more than just protecting the environment within their
 own company in cooperation with the global nature fund gnf kärcher founded the

responsibility for
the supply chain
and products

consumers are critical these days they
now ask more questions before purchasing
than they used to they want to know
where was the product produced by whom
and under what conditions what materials
is it made of and can it be recycled after
wards how efficiently does the machine
operate kärcher takes these consumer
interests seriously responds to questions
and has the right answers this is because
kärcher is not only the market leader in

the long run kärcher is one of the few companies in germany
to have established its own erp laboratory erp  energy

not only is the energy use during cleaning measured but
dust emissions the quantity of dust particles that are
released into the ambient air from the machine are also
under scrutiny

noise pollution
although we usually only notice an excessively high energy
use when reading the electricity bill we experience unpleas
ant or loud sounds immediately noise emissions are therefore
also an important aspect which we include in the develop
ment of our products from the very beginning therefore a
reduction of 10 db a is already perceived by operators as
a 50 per cent reduction in the noise level because of this
our dry vacuum cleaners are ideally suited for longer oper
ating periods and noisesensitive areas such as hotels
