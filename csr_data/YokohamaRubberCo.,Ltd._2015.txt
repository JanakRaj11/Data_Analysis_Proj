      energyefficient greenhouse gasfree hydrogen will surely become a common
      energy source essential to our everyday life in the future as the use of hydrogen
      energy has expanded to household fuel cells as well as fcvs and is still expanding
      yokohama rubber is committed to the development of hydrogen gas hoses that
      ensure stable operation in a variety of harsh environments our hope as the
      development team is to make contributions to the solution of global warming

       the fourth graders at otsuchi elementary school joined our treeplanting project
       last year in our reconstruction efforts in otsuchi town i felt rewarded to see the
       children who went through the painful experiences of the great earthquake right
       before their entrance into elementary school plant trees with delight now the
       seedlings in pots have grown just as the children have i am deeply moved by
       thinking about the children proudly talking about the forest to their own children in
       the future when the seedlings they planted have become a forest that protects lives
       i hope that the treeplanting project will help people in the town to look to the
       future

                                              regarding quality control issues yokohama rubber has shifted its focus from preventing
                                              reoccurences to preventing issues from occuring they focus on pursuing the quality that customers
                                              expect collecting information and identifying and removing potential risks regarding quality issues
                                              they act according to sangen shugi three reality principles to understand reality and operate their
                                              business with risk assessments from the customers view point quick responses by analysis and
                                              thought based on risks in the quality management system we would like to suggest expanding the
                                              activities of prevention from occurring to the supply chain as the occurrence rate of quality issues is
                                              expected to increase when overseas suppliers increase in the future

      i first thought that it wouldnt be easy for natural rubber producers to implement csr
      activities as most of their businesses are small however through the visits to our
      partners and rubber farms i learned that our local partner had already started to put
      their care about safety and environment into action we will expand our quality
      verification survey not only to our partners but also to the rubber farms and
      individual producers in the future we seek for what we can do for sustainable natural
      rubber supply and will endeavour to create csr programs which can strengthen the
      relationships with our partners

                                               it is very important for us to establish strong bonds with the local people in indonesia and to
                                               create sustainable value from rubber in order to realize sustainable business especially focusing
                                               on improving the production efficiency of natural rubber we evaluated and built community

                                                    we believe that we can meet our goals and create efficient programs for small rubber farms by
                                               conducting surveys and engaging in dialogue about smallscale farms with yokohama rubber

      since i was designated as a safety and health staff member in july 2014 far from
      developing greater awareness of the issues my days have been filled with trying to
      remember a great deal of new information my biggest concern has been how to protect
      the health and safety of the people who work at our plant i have been trying to
      communicate with the workers while devising various ways to use my feminine wisdom i
      really appreciate the approaches of my bosses and seniors with onsite safety foremost in
      their minds which leads to their own onsite improvements i work hard to develop such
      approaches in order to create a safe and secure plant where all staff members can work in
      peace together

                                                   the characteristic of the safety and health activities of yokohama rubber is that each production
                                                   site has its own wellestablished unique activities tailored to individual situations identified
                                                   through personal activities including oneonone trainings it tends to be considered difficult to
                                                   achieve results of safety and health activities in china where the turnover rate is high but
                                                   yokohama rubber has certainly achieved success through their efforts in educational activities in
                                                   china we expect the wellpositioned plants will lead other plants so as to raise the basic safety
                                                   level we hope that yokohama rubber as a tire manufacturer will protect human safety
