  efforts to reduce the environmental impact of distribution

the need to reduce the amount of energy used in the transportation of products has become a major theme in the fight to prevent global
warming
      as a cargo owner in japan terumo has been making efforts to improve distribution efficiency and construct an efficient
distribution infrastructure by among other things reducing the amount of energy used to transport our products via a modal shift
to shipping contractors with high transportation efficiency increasing sea shipping and integrating and eliminating distribution
centers we have also been monitoring data on the environmental impact of distribution since fiscal 2006 switching from truck to
marine transportation to reduce environmental impact and improving the carry efficiency of our own distribution vehicles




  fujinomiya factory accredited as a supporter of excellence of the 2009 ecoship modal shift project

to reduce co2 emissions produced during the transportation of finished medical devices and
equipment and pharmaceutical products to a warehouse in fukuoka prefecture our
fujinomiya factory in japan through cooperation with mol ferry co ltd has increased
lower co2emitting marine transportation since 2007 as a result co2 emissions have been
drastically reduced by 814 tons or 52 compared with the conventional truck transportation
system employed in fiscal 2008 in recognition of this effort the factory was accredited as a
supporter of excellence of the 2009 ecoship modal shift project which is organized by the
ecoship modal shift project executive committee and supported by the ministry of land

  energysaving driving

we have been promoting ecodriving of work vehicles at all domestic branches this involves taking proactive actions such as promoting
environmentfriendly driving practices eg starting up slowly and eliminating idling reviewing the use of work vehicles and introducing
fuelefficient vehicles including hybrid vehicles into our fleet additionally we relocated our tokyo 3rd branch which mainly works with
university hospitals and acute hospitals in the 23 wards of tokyo from shibuyaku to bunkyoku an area with a high concentration of
hospitals the branch took this opportunity to cut back on the use of work vehicles and instead requires associates to use public
transportation wherever possible for workrelated travel consequently we reduced co2 emissions from gasoline use by about 200 tons
year on year in line with the governmentled challenge 25 campaign we will continue to promote ecodriving whether of work vehicles or
privately owned vehicles




                     committed to ecodriving                                        using public transportation for sales calls

global resources are limited terumo utilizes the resources it requires in the most effective and efficient way possible
we are making efforts to effectively use resources reduce waste and increase recycling throughout the entire company




  making efforts to reduce the amount of landfilled waste
manufacturing processes and business activities at our factories rd center and offices generate a variety of waste we have therefore
set a target of zero waste emissionsdefined as an amount of landfilled waste equal to less than 1 of the total amount of waste
generatedfor all of our sites in japan excepting our sales offices to ensure we achieve this reduction target we urge rigid adherence to
the proper sorting of waste and continue to refine our waste treatment methods and rules in fiscal 2009 only 04 of our total waste by
volume was disposed as landfill meaning that we achieved our zero emission target for the sixth consecutive year




  promoting recycling
while our industrial waste group one of our specialized environmental groups plays a big role in sharing important information among
sites all our associates make efforts to recycle due to their unique properties and product safety concerns it is not usually possible to
recycle our products for use in other medical products we do however recycle various types of waste generated in our production
processes and officebased business activities for use in other plastic products including floor tiles and recycled plastic fuel rpf also
organic sludge generated from wastewater treatment is recycled into organic fertilizer our recycling rate reached 94 in fiscal 2009

  inhouse liquefying of waste plastic for recycling

we have established an experimental facility at our kofu factory in japan to pyrolyze and liquefy waste plastic generated in syringe or
other production processes and have started research into its use as an energy source
waste plastic that could be liquefied for recycling used to be treated externally and recycled as solid fuel which could be used only for
limited purposes liquefied waste plastic on the other hand can be used for a significantly wider range of purposes including as fuel
for boilers and diesel engines we are conducting further research into controlling the state of pyrolysis oil for more effective use

as clearly declared in our basic environmental policy terumo sets voluntary targets and works to conserve the environment
we monitor and control chemical substances according to our own strict voluntary management targets




  introduction of stricter chemicals management

  initiatives to reduce ethylene oxide emissions

ethylene oxide is widely used to sterilize medical devices and equipment we set voluntary concentration controls equivalent to
the environmental standard for tracking concentrations of ethylene oxide at vent outlets as well as emissions at other sites such as
warehouses and manage emissions along the boundaries of our facilities in fiscal 2009 we were able to reduce emissions of ethylene
oxide despite our increased use of the chemical by operating our emissions treatment system we will track the emissions pathway in
more detail to refine our methods for monitoring the levels of emissions

 see the environmental risk assessment of chemical substances second edition ministry of the environment




  additional ethylene oxide emissions treatment facilities installed at fujinomiya factory

in fiscal 2009 we installed an additional catalytic oxidation treatment system which can
detoxify even lowconcentration emissions at fujinomiya factory in japan in response to an
increase in the use of ethylene oxide using this system together with an existing system we
aim to further reduce emissions and improve the work environment in which the processes
using the chemical are performed at all factories where ethylene oxide sterilization is used
terumo has introduced and been operating systems for the detoxification of ethylene oxide
emissions catalytic oxidation treatment systems are in operation at ashitaka factory and the
rd center in japan we are also working on alternatives to ethylene oxide sterilization

  aiming at appropriate pcb management

in accordance with the law concerning special measures for promotion of proper treatment of pcb wastes and the waste management
and public cleansing law we have removed all transformers fluorescent light ballasts and other equipment containing pcbs to ensure
the prompt and appropriate disposal of these materials we completed early registration with the toyota office of the japan environmental
safety corporation jesco
      an investigation conducted by the japan electrical manufacturers association identified pieces of equipment that may
potentially contain trace amounts of pcbs on the basis of the time of manufacture or other factors following this we conducted our
own investigation categorizing and performing a complete analysis of every piece of equipment including examining manufacturer
warranties with the exception of those that could not be analyzed due to their sealed nature these will be examined when they reach
the end of their life

  green procurement

  toward the establishment of a green conformity assurance system

european environmental regulations rohsweee as well as chinese and japanese laws restrict the use of hazardous substances in
electrical and electronic equipment or require that such equipment be labeled meanwhile creating a conformity assurance system to
bring medical devices which are not yet targeted by the eu s rohs directive into conformity with these regulations is a vital task in the
achievement of ecofriendly operation
       our basic policy on conformity assurance is to prevent harmful substances from entering the factory and also prevent them from
exiting this concept is not vastly different from the traditional concept of quality assurance for medical devices it was necessary however
to add new rules to the management procedures due to the need to handle management elements not conventionally present we thus
added the following management steps the main elements of which had already been stipulated

         1
             procedure for determining which items are subject to the assurance system
         2   procedure for determining conformity of parts and materials purchased and products shipped
             created determination flow and determination standards for purchased partsmaterials partially implemented
         3
             procedure for tracking information about substances contained in purchased partsmaterials
             created instructions for investigating substance composition and began periodic investigations in fy 2007
         4   procedure for ecofriendly product design
             provide results of substance composition investigation via database and provide conformity training
         5   procedure for risk management
             risk analysisimprovement instructionsdetermination of whether selfdeclarations are allowed

     in the future we will integrate each of these procedures in turn into our quality management system to construct an overall
conformity assurance system

environmental auditing

as clearly declared in our basic environmental policy terumo conducts regular internal environmental audits to prevent illegal
acts and environmental problems




  status of internal environmental audits for fiscal 2009
to prevent illegal acts and environmental problems and reduce present and future environmental risks we conduct internal environmental
audits of factories in japan shonan center head ofﬁce sales ofﬁces and terumo group companies

  audit tasks

1 clarify environmental laws and ordinances and check compliance

2 check the status of management of environmental risk items and their performance

             status of operation of our environmental management organization
             status of waste management and related risk management
             progress and results of energy management and energy conservation projects
             status of chemicals management and related risk management


  audit results

with regard to environmental laws and ordinances major noncompliance was not detected and a
management system was in place at all sites for environmental risks
      in fiscal 2009 regulatory authorities conducted an external onsite inspection of specified factories
and offices focusing on environmental issues particularly with regard to a specified building and a cold
evaporator equipment for liquefied nitrogen following these inspections we received no remedial
instructions from authorities
                                                                                                               internal environmental audit
