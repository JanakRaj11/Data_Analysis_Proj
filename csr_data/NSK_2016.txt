        building a stronger business foundation
          the final year of our fourth midterm management plan
        in fiscal 2014 the intermediate year of our fourth midterm management plan we achieved record highs for net sales and operating
        income surpassing the numerical targets of the plan a full year ahead of schedule this strong performance was attributable to growth
        in our electric power steering business and effective cost reduction measures as well as a boost from external factors such as demand
        growth driven by the gradual economic recovery and the weak yen
           fiscal 2015 is the third and final year of our current midterm management plan as an even more important goal than our
        numerical targets we will press ahead with measures to increase our fundamental capabilities in sales technology production and
        management all of which underlie our success in sales and income
           going forward we will step up our efforts to realize the plans overarching vision of establishing corporate fundamentals
        appropriate for a company with net sales of 1 trillion


        contributing to the wellbeing and safety of society and protecting the global environment
          environmentally responsible prosperity
        the abnormal weather occurring across the world in recent years including devastating typhoons unprecedented torrential rainfall
        droughts and subsequent crop damage largescale forest fires and recordbreaking cold and heat waves indicates that climate change
        due to global warming presents real risks meanwhile the human pursuit of materially abundant lifestyles is growing stronger economic
        activity is increasing and emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases continue to rise it is becoming more important than
        ever for companies to help preserve a healthy global environment as they work to sustain social development
           it is in this context that we see worldwide upgrades to social infrastructure and new technology development taking placeall efforts to
        secure social progress and ensure environmental protection for instance many of the worlds countries are developing environmentally
        friendly transportation infrastructure including urban railway networks such as subways and elevated railroads as well as the construction
        of highspeed railways connecting major cities additionally selfdriving vehicle technology developed by automakers and it companies
        has reached the pilot stage whats more a fuelcell car that converts the energy of hydrogen into electricity through a chemical reaction
        that does not emit carbon dioxide while driving was commercially released in japan in december 2014
           developments like these lead to the creation of things that never existed before through greater sophistication and integration of
        materials as well as mechanical electronic and information technologies they suggest the growing potential to bring innovation to
        peoples lives local communities and global society

          leveraging the art of manufacturing to achieve greater growth
          nsk has declared in its corporate philosophy a commitment to fostering social progress by aiming to contribute to the wellbeing

          motion  control accordingly nsk has steadily carried out initiatives befitting a qualitydriven manufacturer 
            for example nsk has provided highperformance railway axle bearings since the shinkansen bullet train first went into operation
          in 1964 these bearings had to provide outstanding reliability and the ability to perform at high speeds while over time getting
          smaller and lighter in recognition of superior performance in these areas nsk bearings were adopted for the hokuriku shinkansen
          which went into service in march 2015
             responding to the needs of automakers we have repeatedly made improvements to the features quality and costs of our
          various products including bearings parts for automatic transmissions and steering systems meanwhile on our manufacturing
          floors we have achieved virtually all of the goals set out in our environmental voluntary action plan making steady progress with
          improvements to equipment processes and methods as well as saving energy and recycling
             the nsk group aims to leverage the art of manufacturing to achieve even greater growth  we are determined to stay on the
          path of constant development by delivering new technologies products and services toward that end we will first of all make

          corporate governance

        basic approach
        nsk regards corporate governance as a structure that enables the operational organizations to realize efficient and fair
        management under the supervision of the board of directors the corporate governance rules which are part of nsks
        inhouse regulations articulate the basic approach to and framework of corporate governance at the nsk group
          nsks efforts to strengthen corporate governance are based on the following four policies

          1 improve management flexibility by delegating more authority from the board of directors to operational organizations
          2 ensure the super vision of the operational organizations by the super visor y organizations by separating the former and the latter
          3 strengthen the super vision of the operational organizations by the super visor y organizations through close coordination
              between the former and the latter and
          4 increase management fairness by strengthening the compliance system



         corporate governance structure
        nsk operates under a company with nomination committees etc system in which executive and supervisory roles are
        clearly defined with the aim of maintaining and enhancing management soundness and transparency for the operating
        organizations the ceo makes final management decisions and the executive officers appointed by the board of
        directors oversee the specific operational functions under the direction of the ceo

        consign the survey again expanding its scope to include sites outside of japan


          strengthening antibribery measures
        given stronger antibribery regulations in many countries the nsk code of corporate ethics was revised in may 2014 in

          preventing insider trading
        the internal regulation for preventing insider trading applies to all officers and employees it requires nsk officers
        and employees to submit a form whenever they buy or sell nsk shares awareness of this regulation is being promoted
        in elearning programs and the compliance newsletter additionally in september 2014 nsk adopted an approval
        application system


          avoiding all contact with organized criminal elements
        the nsk code of corporate ethics prohibits any contact with organized criminal elements in order to clarify the need to
        avoid any association with organized crime even in transactions with suppliers the basic procurement contract used by
        nsk has been revised contracts are now being updated through consultation with suppliers


          security export control initiatives
        the nsk group has strengthened its system of controls for preventing the export of products and leakage of technology
        related to the development manufacture and use of weapons based on japans foreign exchange and foreign trade
        acts in 2014 nsk in japan started improving the technical information regime regarding plant machinery in addition
        nsk sought to reinforce the shipment regime including inspecting the customs entry results of controlled products in
        2015 nsk plans to continue such initiatives and extend the scope of items subject to management


          complying with regulations for disclosure of conflict mineral informations
        basic approach
        nsks procurement policy seeks to ensure that its entire supply chain is free from any payment to antisocial armed forces
        engaging in human rights violations whenever the possibility of such payments is discovered nsk takes measures to
        avoid the use of the parts raw materials or other supplies concerned


        action update
        the disclosure rule under the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the united states
        requires an annual survey and disclosure of information on the status of use of four conflict minerals tin tantalum
        tungsten and gold originating in the democratic republic of the congo and surrounding countries
           its goal is to cut off the source of funding for armed groups and rebels involved in human rights violations nsk is not
        listed on a us stock exchange and so is not subject to these rules nevertheless nsk has adopted a policy of avoiding
        the use of conflict minerals and is working with its suppliers on this issue
           in 2013 nsk added an article concerning conflict mineral initiatives to the nsk supplier csr guidelines in order to
        communicate this policy to suppliers in fiscal 2014 the groups supplier survey found no evidence that nsks suppliers

           when i found out that my wife was pregnant i felt that i was the only one who could suppor t
           her as both of our parents live far away although we considered the option of her returning to
           her parents house to give bir th newborn babies grow so fast during the early days and weeks
           i wanted to be involved in this process as a father so i took approximately two months of
           childcare leave
              before the childcare leave began i was looking forward to spending time with my child
           but initially my hands were full taking care of unfamiliar housework leaving only a little time
           to spend with my child it taught me how difficult it is to take care of a child while handling
           housework at the same time however my efficiency improved as time passed allowing me to
           spend precious time with my wife and baby
              taking childcare leave allowed me to better understand my childs feelings moreover being able to pay constant
           attention to the feelings of my wife helped us understand each other better than ever at work i am tr ying to shor ten the
           time required to finish my duties by standardizing daily tasks
              to be honest it takes courage to take as much as two months off from work in my case i consulted my boss more
           than six months in advance and asked my colleagues for their cooperation i was apprehensive before taking the leave
           but my understanding boss and suppor tive colleagues helped me through it i am truly grateful to be in such a for tunate
           position the company has programs allowing both women and men to take childcare leave i recommend ever yone to
           embrace the new challenge of childcare and not to miss the oppor tunity to discover a new side of yourself

          in china where the number of plants has increased rapidly the number of occupational accidents was on an upward
          trend accompanying the growth in plants in response nsk took a firm topdown approach developing a safety
          management system strengthening safety education and implementing hazard prediction activities and monthly
          workplace inspections as a result the number of occupational accidents fell by 50 in fiscal 2014 the group put
          special effort into safety education producing educational materials for team leaders and holding related study
          meetings 812 employees in total attended the study meetings
             the group also established a safety dojo at all plants launching handson education for both new employees
          and veterans at these sites employees can gain awareness of
          workplace dangers and the importance of work rules by experiencing
          simulated accidents in addition the group developed new educa
          tional materials and improved existing programs particularly those
          aimed at new employees as a result it was able to reduce the number
          of occupational accidents caused by employees who had been on the
          job for less than a year to onethird that of the previous fiscal year

            compliance and response to complaints
          basic approach
          the nsk group complies with relevant environmentrelated laws and carries out initiatives in line with policies for
          preventing environmental pollution and reducing environmental impact additionally in the event of an environmental
          accident or legal violation the group investigates the cause and promptly implements countermeasures


          preventing a recurrence of emissions standards being exceeded
          in fiscal 2014 there were no serious legal violations or environmental pollution accidents however there was one
          incident of drainage standards being exceeded at a site in japan and two incidents of standards being exceeded under
          regulations related to volatile organic compounds vocs at a site in europe the drainage standard issue was caused by
          oil in wastewater due to the washing of dishes in the cafeteria management was improved by installing a grease trap that
          captures oil contained in wastewater the voc regulation issue in europe was caused by kerosene used in the product
          washing process plans are underway to switch to a cleaning liquid that does not contain vocs


          remediating soil and groundwater pollution
          the nsk group completely eliminated the use of chlorinated organic solvents in fiscal 2003 however the remediation of
          groundwater is continuing at four sites where soil and groundwater pollution remains from past use the group regularly
          monitors groundwater and reports remediation progress to the authorities

          environmental accounting japan
        the nsk group has disclosed the results of environmental accounting a tool for quantitatively ascertaining and
        evaluating the costs and results of environmental protection activities the group also has introduced environmental
        accounting as an information tool to broaden peoples understanding of the groups activities
           environmental conservation costs in fiscal 2014 consisted of about 34 billion yen in investments including the
        installation of solar power generation units and around 106 billion yen in expenses the economic benefits of these
        investments amounted to roughly 14 billion yen the nsk group is striving to create products that help to reduce
        environmental impact approximately 65 of its environmental conservation costs were for rd in environmentally
        friendly products and technologies please see the appendix section of this reportp 64 for more information

          creating environmentally friendly products
        transforming the structure of society to reduce risks from events such as increasingly largescale natural disasters
        related to climate change and to prevent the depletion of natural resources is a common challenge for humanity toward
        that end companies are expected to make positive contributions through their products and services this includes
        the development of new technologies making those newly developed technologies even more sophisticated to aid in
        environmental protection and increasing utilization of renewable energy


        policy
        harnessing nsks four core technologies to help reduce the environmental impact of human societies
        the products of the future must perform better than todays in order to help reduce the impact human societies have
        on the natural environment in an effort to contribute to the wellbeing and safety of society and to protect the global
        environment as spelled out by its corporate philosophy nsk is working hard to accurately determine the needs of its
        customers and the broader society as well as to develop environmentally friendly products and technologies which in
        keeping with its basic policy make the most of the companys four core technologies tribology material engineering
        analysis technology and mechatronics by delivering these products and technologies to all corners of the globe nsk
        aims to contribute to the sophistication of the machinery in which its products are incorporated and to the development
        of environmentally friendly products as well as to the reduction of environmental impact throughout society

                                           basic policy for the development of environmentally friendly products

                                the nsk group minimizes the environmental impact of its products at every stagefrom rd and design
                                to production usage and disposalby upholding the following standards

                                1 each product should contribute toward the energy and resource conservation of the machine in which it is
                                   installed
                                2 the amount of energy and resources required during product manufacturing should be minimal
                                3 environmentally harmful substances should not be used in products or manufacturing processes
                                4 products should contribute to the health and safety of end users by having low emissions of vibration noise

        midterm goals fy20132015
        the nsk group is creating even more environmentally friendly products and technologies based on the nsk
        environmental policy and the basic policy for the development of environmentally friendly products it also calculates
        how much its products help to reduce co2 emissions during use


        fy2014 activities

        in fiscal 2014 the nsk group developed 12 new environmentally friendly products that help customers conserve energy
        and resources the total number of environmentally friendly products developed since 2002 comes to 202


        nsk ecoefficiency indicators
        the nsk ecoefficiency indicator neco system is an nskoriginal benchmark established in 2008 for quantitatively
        evaluatingearly on in the development phasethe degree of environmental contribution a product will make and since
        its creation has been used to evaluate product development a products neco score is calculated by dividing product
        value v which is an indicator of how much the new products lifetime and performance have been improved over the
        previous product by environmental impact e which is an indicator based on parameters such as product weight and
        energy consumption the better the product performance and lower the environmental impact the higher the neco value
        is currently the group is working to develop new products with a neco score of 12 or higher

          global warming countermeasures
        concerns are mounting that todays increasingly serious climate change problems have the potential to cause
        tremendous damage including rising sea levels droughts localized torrential rain and the spread of infectious diseases
        as well as having harmful effects on ecosystems at present the world is debating how to achieve substantial reductions
        in emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gases to help build a lowcarbon society companies are expected to
        make aggressive efforts to develop new and more advanced technologies that will lead to energy savings they are
        also required to help popularize energysaving products and reduce the co2 emissions generated by their business
        operations


        nsks approach
        amid growing concerns about global warming the onus is on companies to develop energysaving technologies
        popularize energysaving products and reduce co2 emissions generated by their business operations
         nsk is committed to developing and broadly disseminating environmentally friendly products with the aim of reducing
        co2 emissions throughout society as a whole the group is also making efforts to reduce co2 emissions in its business
        operations through improvement in the efficiency of energy use and the adoption of clean energies


         contributing to the fight against global warming by creating environmentally friendly products and reducing energy use in operations

        midterm goals fy20132015
        the nsk group has established co2 emissions reduction goals related to manufacturing distribution and offices and is
        carrying out efforts to reach the goals
          the group is saving energy by streamlining production at its production sites in and outside japan in addition the
        group is reducing co2 emissions by promoting initiatives including implementing fuel conversion replacing machines
        adding inverters to compressors reducing the use of compressed air by switching to energysaving spindles adopting
        led lighting and installing gas cogeneration systems
          under its environmental logistics policy the group strives to reduce the environmental impact of transport through
        improved loading efficiency achieved by combining product distribution and procured part distribution and by shifting to
        modes of transport with lower environmental impact
          the head office and sales divisions have also made efforts to save energy including controlling airconditioning
        temperatures turning off lights when not in use and switching to led lighting additionally the group is switching
        company vehicles to electric hybrid and vehicles with smalldisplacement engines

          plants outside japan achieved a 283  reduction in co2 emissions per valueadded production unit from the fiscal
        2011 level exceeding the target of a 3 reduction as a result of improvement in productivity associated with increased
        production and the increase in operations that emit comparatively lower amounts of co2

          measures for resource conservation and recycling
        there is growing concern around the world that an economic system based on mass production mass consumption
        and mass disposal will end up depleting a wide range of resources in the future against this backdrop companies are
        required to help build recyclingoriented societies by ensuring the efficient use of resources throughout the entire product
        lifecyclefrom the extraction of resources to product use to disposal additionally there is concern that the increase in
        worldwide demand for water will lead to the depletion of water resources in the future companies must therefore make
        efficient use of water resources


        nsks approach
        the nsk group aims to make efficient use of the resources it requires for raw materials and is working on reducing
        reusing and recycling the 3rs striving to do its part in building recyclingoriented societies around the world the
        groups development and design divisions strive to develop products that can be produced with the minimum amount
        of raw materials and that can be easily recycled when disposed after use the groups manufacturing and distribution
        divisions attempt to reduce the generation of waste and also work to reuse and recycle waste that is generated aiming
        to eliminate landfill waste disposal as for water the nsk group has judged that there is a low possibilityunder existing
        conditionsof it being impacted by water shortages based on the volume of water it uses and where its business sites
        are located still the group remains committed to the efficient use of water realizing that the future may bring a serious
        global shortage of water resources

        the nsk group is strengthening its initiatives to achieve the rigorous goals it set for the effective utilization of resources
        recycling rate and landfill disposal rate the group constantly pursues higher performance on the 3rs it will also start
        working on reducing water withdrawal per unit of production
          manufacturing sites in japan have already achieved their goals for zero emissions the elimination of landfill waste
        disposal with a recycling rate close to 100 now they are aiming to achieve a recycling rate of 100 of industrial waste
        by the end of fiscal 2015
        the nsk group has defined zero emissions as a landfill disposal rate of no more than 001

        nsk has steadily reduced steel material waste by changing the forging shape for parts the nsk groups plants in
        japan achieved a waste recycling rate of 99999 and a landfill disposal rate of 0001 by thoroughly sorting waste and
        expanding the channels for use of recycled waste this performance met fiscal 2014 targets on the other hand plants
        outside japan did manage to increase their recycling rate to 945 however did not attain their target of at least 977
        plants in japan reduced industrial waste per production unit by 298 compared to a target of a 20 reduction from
        fiscal 2011 levels they also reduced packaging material waste per production unit by 161 compared to a target of a
        7 reduction from the fiscal 2007 level with respect to water withdrawal per production unit plants in japan achieved a
        255 reduction and plants outside japan achieved a 336 reduction compared to a target of a 3 reduction from fiscal

        punching out steel sheet with a die conventionally even if the size of the cages differed a little the width of the steel
        sheet and the punching pitch of the dies were kept the same however nsk optimized the width of the steel sheet and the
        punching pitch of the dies for the varying cage sizes in order to reduce wasted material this reduced steel sheet waste

            manufacturing 2 initiatives to reduce industrial waste
          in fiscal 2014 the group strove to optimize its recycling contractors in each area where it has plants as a result a greater
          amount of waste was reused as a valuable resource reducing industrial waste per production unit by 298 and greatly
          surpassing the goal of a 20 reduction in fiscal 2015 the group will implement further initiatives to reach its new goal of
          a 32 reduction


              distribution       increasing reuse and recycling of used packing materials
          the nsk group is working to use fewer packaging materials by meticulously sorting used packaging
            in fiscal 2014 the group reduced the total amount of discarded burnables by 682 from the previous fiscal year by
          resorting burnables into recyclable material and nonrecyclable material and recycling the recyclable material the
          group also reduced waste by 234 tons for the year by reusing pallets used for import when exporting

          reducing use of environmentally harmful substances
        chemical substances have made modern life much more convenient however some chemicals can have adverse effects
        on human health and the environment at the world summit on sustainable development in 2002 the nations of the world
        reaffirmed their commitment to aim by 2020 to use and produce chemicals in ways that do not lead to significant adverse
        effects on human health and the environment since then the international community has been working cooperatively to
        regulate chemical substances more strictly


        nsks approach
        the nsk group is striving to create products that use no environmentally harmful substances ahead of laws and
        regulations around the world and voluntary standards from its customers responding to stricter regulations the group
        tightly controls environmentally harmful substances through each stage of development and design procurement
        manufacturing and distribution to ensure that safe products are delivered to customers


         goals and performance
          midterm goals fy20132015
        to ensure the products it delivers are safe the nsk group is reinforcing its systems for global management of
        environmentally harmful substances and systems for ensuring that products contain no environmentally harmful
        substances
           the nsk group is also upgrading its management systems for the development and design processes and rolling
        out green procurement to its global production sites the group additionally aims to further reduce environmentally
        harmful substances handled during production processes the group is focused on establishing a global management
        framework by surveying the inclusion of environmentally harmful substances in parts and raw materials based on the
        latest nsk list of environmentally harmful substances



           f iscal 2015 targets for reducing use of environmentally harmful substances
          development and design
          establish a development and design management system that ensures environmentally harmful substances are not contained in products
          procurement
          complete the extension of nsk green procurement to key suppliers worldwide
          manufacturing
          complete a global chemical substance quality assurance system for products
          totally eliminate machining fluids containing chlorine additives
          in japan	reduce the handling of prtrdesignated substances per production unit by 25 compared to fiscal 2011




          management system
        the nsk group is striving to strengthen its management by implementing initiatives not only in japan but also at plants
        worldwide to reliably ensure that environmentally harmful substances are not included in products and then auditing the
        status of implementation
          in fiscal 2014 the group conducted onsite audits at four plants in china two plants in europe and three plants in the
        us these audits identified problems and specified points requiring further attention and needed changes were made
        reinforcing the management system
          furthermore the group trained 34 new environmentally harmful substance auditors in japan and 12 outside japan
        bringing the total up to 319 so that plants around the world can autonomously conduct selfaudits and supplier audits

          fy2014 activities

          following on from fiscal 2013 the nsk group revised the nsk list of environmentally harmful substances again in fiscal 2014 in
          response to legislative amendments in europe in order to enhance management of environmentally harmful substances it conducted
          a survey not only in japan but also at production sites worldwide of environmentally harmful substances inclusion in parts and raw
          materials and strengthened its management so that environmentally harmful substances are not used in products moreover the
          group promoted initiatives to totally eliminate use of machining fluids containing chlorine additives in manufacturing processes


                 design            taking action based on the nsk list of environmentally harmful substances
          nsk has registered nearly 3500 chemical substances in its nsk list of environmentally harmful substances as prohibited substances
          reduced substances and observation substances the group is aiming for zero use of environmentally harmful substances in the
          manufacture of its products
            as in the previous fiscal year the nsk group conducted a survey in fiscal 2014 of parts and materials suppliers based on the list to
          make sure that substances prohibited by nsk are not included in its products nsk also listed all parts that have been confirmed not to
          contain substances prohibited by nsk and worked on building a system that ensures design departments check that products under
          development contain no harmful substances


            procurement 1         worldwide efforts to increase awareness of nsk green procurement standards
          the nsk group cooperates with suppliers in an effort to strengthen the management of environmentally harmful substances and
          procure environmentally friendly parts and raw materials to make the nsk green procurement standards well known outside japan
          the group holds briefing sessions for suppliers around the world and obtains agreement forms pledging adherence to the standards
            the nsk groups production sites worldwide will continue to work with suppliers to manufacture dependably safe products


            procurement 2          improving onsite audits of suppliers
          the nsk group conducts periodic audits of suppliers of parts and raw materials with a high possibility of containing or carrying
          environmentally harmful substances group employees who hold qualifications as environmentally harmful substance auditors visit
          suppliers and conduct the audits using an nsk audit check sheet this has strengthened environmental initiatives throughout the
          supply chain in fiscal 2014 onsite audits were conducted at 44 suppliers in japan and 12 suppliers outside japan the group is
          working with suppliers to follow up on improvements to issues identified through the audits going forward the nsk group will step
          up its audits of suppliers outside japan aiming to complete onsite audits of all of its principal suppliers by 2015 the nsk group is
          committed to further strengthening its management system for environmentally harmful substances

           biodiversity conservation
          there are believed to be some 30 million species of organisms on earth today which have been adapting to their
          specific environments for as long as several millenia these organisms live in connection with one another supporting
          one another through the food chain and the oxygencarbon dioxide cycle based on photosynthesis the food clothing
          and shelter which people need to live totally depend on the bounty of biodiversity aiming to conserve biodiversity the
          convention on biological diversity was concluded at the earth summit in 1992 in 2008 a new law in japan the basic act
          on biodiversity came into effect


          nsks approach
          although nsks business operations have a comparatively minor direct impact on biodiversity its strong efforts in
          areas such as energy conservation and air and water quality management play a role in preserving biodiversity the
          materials that the group procures however have an indirect impact on biodiversity when traced back through the
          supply chain nsk is committed to contributing to biodiversity conservation by identifying the direct and indirect impacts
          that its business has on biodiversity and using its findings to improve its business operations and enhance its social
          contributions


          basic policy

                                                                            basic policy

                               the nsk group recognizes the importance of biodiversity and understands the relationship between our
                               business activities and the ecosystem we aim to reduce our impact on the environment by creating systems
                               and initiatives that ensure biodiversity is conserved



            action agenda
           1research and development
             we will contribute to the conser vation of biodiversity by developing products that save energy and resources
           2procurement and purchasing

                                                        thirdparty comments
again this year nsk asked professor yoshinao kozuma of sophia universitys faculty of economics to provide third
party comments on this report




                                       yoshinao kozuma
                                       professor faculty of economics sophia university japan

                                        after leaving the sophia university graduate school of economics upon earning credits in the latter half of the
                                        doctoral program professor kozuma worked as a research assistant at the nagoya institute of technology a
                                        visiting researcher at the limperg instituut in the netherlands an associate professor at the university of shizuoka
                                        and an associate professor in the faculty of economics at sophia university before taking up his current position
                                        he has held successive positions as the chair or member of various csr or environmentrelated advisory panels
                                        study groups and research conferences for the ministry of the environment the ministry of economy trade and
                                        industry the ministry of land infrastructure and transport the ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries
                                        the cabinet office and the japanese institute of certified public accountants his specialty is environmental

1 establishment of a new management vision
it seems like fiscal 2014 was a major turning point for nsk not only did the company post record net sales and operating income while achieving the sales
goals in its fourth midterm management plan it also established and officially announced nsk vision 2026 a new management vision looking ahead to
the companys next era this new vision is a 10year growth model starting in 2016 the year of nsks 100th anniversary under the slogan setting the
future in motion the vision is an image of how nsk will achieve the various kinds of motion needed for future business development by actively focusing
on peoples lives and the society of the future moreover this new motion movement and action will contribute to the creation of shared value between
nsk and society this is a strong commitment toward the realization of a sustainable society unique to nsk which recognizes future generations as
stakeholders
    what is needed to achieve this kind of future vision is the establishment of a sound governance system appropriate information disclosure is also
an essential factor nsk has been continuously working to improve the quality of its csr information disclosure this year it substantially enhanced the
amount of information disclosed especially in the area of governance it also included environmental data by country which had previously only been
disclosed online i hope that this positive motion will continue in the future

2 effects of diversity initiatives
in terms of social aspects i have noticed that the effects of nsks diversity initiatives are gradually starting to appear the fact that the numbers of people
utilizing the reemployment system for seniors and childcare leave for men have been increasing should be lauded the increase in childcare leave for
men in particular is an indicator of the soundness and effectiveness of csr management since it is often difficult for men to take this kind of leave without
organizational support the fact that the employment rate for persons with disabilities has been rising consistently also deserves a positive evaluation
however the reporting scope for social aspects still focuses on the group in japan and does not reflect the current reality of nsk where employees
outside japan comprise 64 of the groups total staff this area requires immediate improvement


3 strengthening of compliance
in november 2014 the korea fair trade commission ruled that nsk had violated competition law this time the company escaped penalties and
a criminal indictment due to the application of a leniency system but it was a further reminder that the companys past business practices were
inappropriate i believe that nsk needs to use this opportunity to remind itself the seriousness of the situation in fiscal 2014 nsk moved ahead steadily
with improvements to its compliance system including the implementation of a compliance awareness survey however those efforts including
measurement of results require further strengthening


4 other challenges
in terms of management of csr targets and performance other than environmental indicators many targets are qualitative making it impossible to
evaluate progress numerically additional explanations regarding the basis for evaluation would therefore increase the reliability of reporting furthermore
there are some environmental targets that have not been met for several successive years the company may need to reconsider either the targets
themselves or the effectiveness of its environmental management

thank you for your candid comments on our csr report 2015
   we regard these as an important contribution to the ongoing development of our csr activities which form a key element
of nsk vision 2026 setting the future in motion
   we appreciate your recognition of our progress in enhancing the disclosure of information on governance and the
environment nevertheless we also understand that there are aspects of nsks csr management that need further
improvement both in our disclosures and in the substance of our activities
   as a global company we are committed to reporting in accordance with international standards such as the g4
sustainability reporting guidelines
   we acknowledge the urgency of your request that we extend the disclosure of social aspects to include the group beyond
japan and will improve this issue in our next report
   further to your comments on our environmental targets we are reviewing these and our environmental management
activities
   finally regarding compliance we recognize that this issue needs continuous focus and effort throughout the group
