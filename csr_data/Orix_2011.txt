change until the earthquake                                                                          power want to see a transition to clean energy over the long term but
   for example some people seem to think that it would be better to                                  there are differences of opinion as to the timeframe
live with a shortage of electricity rather than to continue to use nuclear                            miyauchi there are relatively significant differences when you think
power in the end however that seems to amount to a denial of                                       about the impact on daily life rather than getting caught up in these
civilization and i think that it is a mistake to look for answers based                              types of disagreements however i think it is essential that we take a
on the assumption of reduced economic strength in addition if we                                    multifaceted longterm approach to discussing this issue
halt nuclear power we will have no choice but to depend on thermal




 ebw was established in 2004 when then minister of the environment yuriko koike held meetings with 10 women executives and opinion leaders who were active in environmentrelated areas
  firstround members ebw conducts activities that support the development of environmental businesses and people working in environmental businesses from the perspective of women
  leaders the theme of the organizations activities is the creation of a virtuous cycle between the environment and the economy the minister of the environment subsequently held a series of
  meetings and ebw continued to communicate its message to society while adding members the fourth round of members has since joined increasing ebws membership to 39 members
  in june 2007 ebw became a limited liability intermediary organization

                                                      both as a finance provider and
                                                              as a business operator
                                                                                    yoshihiko miyauchi




an age of electric power options                                                            in addition to wind power and solar power renewable energy also
oba energy also involves an aspect of quality methods of electric                    includes geothermal and biomass isnt orix also active in biomass
power generation from which output fluctuates daily such as solar                       power generation
power generation are sufficient to meet the needs of typical                            miyauchi we have just recently started commercial operation at the
households however they dont offer the high quality that is                           agatsuma biomass power plant in agatsuma gunma prefecture
necessary in industry that is a stable supply with limited fluctuations                biomass presents issues that will require ongoing attention in the
in voltage and frequency nuclear power is indispensable for this                       future such as a stable supply of wood chips but i think it is important
i think for example that we would be able to make some progress                        to first move ahead and take on the challenge
toward resolving energy issues if electric power was graded by                           kawaguchi also geothermal power generation involves the use of
quality say from 1 to 3 and customers were categorized by the grade                    heat that is already being generated naturally so i think that we need
of power they use some customers would require the higherquality                       to include geothermal as well however there is also the issue of the
grade 1 while grade 3 would be adequate for others                                     extent to which various regulations will hinder development what is
miyauchi thats right detailed coordination would be necessary to                      important is that we expand our range of options by diversifying our
make it happen another approach might be to limit the use of                            sources of energy so that for example we can shift to geothermal or
grade 1 electric power to only those customers that truly need high                     solar power if the price of biomass fuel increases
quality power such as plants manufacturing precision machinery in
japan there is a strong tendency to pursue the highest levels of                        environmental business initiatives from a
service in all fields in some cases though i think that might not be                  financial services provider
economically rational                                                                   kawaguchi orix group is developing highly original and interesting
yoshitaka in addition to securing sources and the use of electric                       financial services moving forward what types of businesses are you
power how we will prevent the hollowing out of domestic industry is                     considering in the environmental field
also an important issue in asia the introduction of renewable energy                   miyauchi i believe that the role of financial services is to support the
has begun to pick up speed but the majority of the equipment used                       popularization of new technologies and systems through financial
in those initiatives is made in china or south korea equipment made                     functions i think that there are two directions in the design of
in japan is hardly used at all due to cost issues first we need a                      environmentally friendly systems one is to establish strict regulations
vision for the future of japan and then we can move ahead with                          the other is to focus on providing directional guidance in areas where
discussions about electric power based on that vision                                   strict regulations need not be established
kawaguchi thinking realistically about balance with the economy it                        in the energy field for example if strict regulations are established
is vital that a clear distinction be drawn by clarifying the criteria for                with a focus on stability and safety the cost of meeting those
decommissioning nuclear reactors that have reached the end of their                      standards becomes quite high however because all of the market
useful life so that dangerous reactors do not remain in use and safe                     participants face the same standards the principle of competition
reactors are approved for reuse                                                         can function within those parameters on the other hand relatively




                                                   by changing the perspective it is clear that the environmental and
                                                   energy fields have great potential for growth
                                                   in the future i would like to see orix serve as a driving force behind
                                                   the development of businesses in these fields
                                                   mariko kawaguchi
                                                   mariko kawaguchi has 15 years of environmental management and socially responsible investment survey and research
                                                   experience she has conducted surveys and research on global trends in evaluating companies based on environmental
                                                   social and governance esg issues and the reflection of principles for responsible investment pri in investment decisions
                                                   she has also promoted the popularization of these concepts in japan




                                                                                                                                                                                    06

                                                      energy also involves an aspect of quality
                                                      i think we would be able to make some progress toward
                                                      resolving energy issues if electric power was graded by quality
                                                      miyuki oba
                                                      miyuki oba holds a doctorate degree in engineering specializing in heat transfer throughout her career she has
                                                      researched the energy consumption of households and companies based on which she has proposed energysaving
                                                      measures for the different life stages of a household or company after working at the energy conservation center
                                                      japan she moved on to establish environment and energy research co ltd in 1998




loose standards can hinder the introduction of renewable energy                          following the lead of emerging countries in this field also as energy
which has high generation costs and there will be a need for subsidies                   prices have risen dramatically emerging countries which had
to promote the adoption of these renewable energy technologies                           previously wanted as much energy as they could get for economic
although the establishment of reasonable regulations is a difficult                       development are starting to emphasize energy conservation in this
task with a choice between establishing regulations and fostering                        setting the japanese government is aggressively promoting japans
competition in a highcost environment on one hand and offering                          energy conservation technologies in emerging countries
subsidies and providing guidance on the other in either case a                               also there is a move toward the creation of emissions trading
finance scheme and financial services to provide the necessary                            markets in asian countries such as china south korea thailand and
capital are indispensable                                                                indonesia
yoshitaka i think that subsidies are good for getting these technologies                     moving forward in addition to the existing international emissions
off the ground but the use of subsidies causes a lack of continuity                      trading schemes the japanese government with the ministry of
and autonomy another method is to use the market function for                            economy trade and industry meti taking the lead has proposed a
trading environmental added value such as with emissions trading                        bilateral credit system to the united nations
kawaguchi there is also the problem of regulations for example                             transactions implemented under the kyoto protocol are based on
the framework linking companies that want to enter the solar power                        strict rules in accordance with multilateral schemes such as the
business but lack sufficient funds with companies that want to provide                    world trade organization wto however as with free trade
support for initiatives such as solar power is still not sufficiently                     agreements fta bilateral credits are determined by the countries
developed                                                                                involved as a result japans co2 emission reduction technologies
miyauchi we are starting to see the emergence of manufacturers that                      could be sold overseas and the resulting reductions could be offset
will guarantee solar power output over the long term with that in place                 against japans reduction targets contributing to the real economy a
the development of a purchasing system will facilitate more reliable                      fund could also be utilized to provide support for superior technologies
cash flows and then it will be easier to obtain financing one thing                      miyauchi i see i was under the impression that the international
japan needs at this point is the establishment of an operating                            implementation of current emission trading schemes continually
environment that makes full use of the high degree of liquidity of                        provides financial support for emerging countries i think that we can
domestic funds in other words we need to create a system that                           expect to see a lot of developments in these areas in the future
makes it easier for financial institutions and investors to provide funding               esco fund a finance scheme that is limited to environmentally friendly capital investment

  the environmental field currently requires a large amount of funds
there is substantial room for privatesector organizations like orix                     waterrelated businesses a huge market
group to take an active role i believe that orix group can contribute                   kawaguchi in the case of developing countries the environmental
to society through its roles as a provider of funds and as a company                     field is relatively broad including not only energy but also water
that is directly engaged in environmental businesses such as power                       forestry resources and agricultural land
generation                                                                               yoshitaka in protecting the forestry resources of emerging countries
  moving forward we will expand both of those roles in growing                           there is some competition to secure resources i have the sense that
markets including overseas                                                              japan unfortunately is one step behind in many areas it is difficult to
                                                                                          resolve problems related to water resources solely with privatesector
developing environmental                                                                  funding there is a need for new schemes such as joint public

businesses overseas                                                                       private initiatives

kawaguchi i would like to ask about environmental businesses                             miyauchi energy is needed for economic activities but water is

overseas                                                                                 essential for human life consequently these are more fundamental

yoshitaka i have been involved with the clean energy business in                         problems in the future achieving substantial growth in waterrelated

developing countries and there are significant changes underway                         businesses will require more than just conducting business in certain

for example the feedin tariff fit system has been introduced in                       sectors such as selling waterrelated equipment overseas for

emerging countries in thailand meanwhile the government has                            example i dont think there will be any substantial gains without a

established an esco fund and together with local banks is                              decisive approach that involves japans public and private sectors in

providing funding on a trial basis i have the sense that japan is                        all types of projects such as water supply sewage and water
                                                                                          purification projects


07    orix group environmental report 20112012

  actually these types of initiatives are already getting underway                                insufficient i therefore hope that orix group will take the lead in
orix group has invested in a water processing company in china                                      opening new markets assume risks and become a leader in the
and a preparatory study has commenced for sewage treatment                                          domestic and overseas environmental business fields
operations in emerging countries i think that the overseas markets                                 oba going forward i think that a massive market for solar panels will
for waterrelated businesses offer significant potential                                           emerge however in order for this market to become selfsustaining
oba speaking of efforts to secure water supplies in regions where                                  there will also have to be a secondary market for used solar panels
water is in short supply fuel cells naturally produce water when                                   i believe that activity in the solar panel market will only begin to take
generating power the water that is produced is pure and therefore                                  off once a market for used solar panels is developed for this reason
drinkable fuel cells generate power using only oxygen or air and                                 i hope that orix group will take steps to stimulate the used solar
hydrogen for this reason installing fuel cells overseas in areas faced                            panel market such as creating a market where solar panels can be
with water shortages can help supply both water and power in                                       reused overseas
overseas environmental businesses i feel that it is not enough to                                  kawaguchi orix group is known for its active development of
simply focus on energy an approach needs to be based on a                                          progressive businesses by leveraging the knowhow it has
broader perspective                                                                                accumulated through the leasing business some believe that japan
kawaguchi the business of producing water is important however                                   lacks energy resources however this is only true with regard to fossil
we need to be careful not to forget the growing need to manage                                      fuels and other finite fuel resources quite the contrary japan has
water usage such as by tracking the water used during manufacturing                                geothermal energy and a warm humid climate that is ideal for
processes at factories these types of watersaving efforts are as                                  biomass power generation in this way there is a clear possibility that
important as energysaving initiatives                                                             japan may become an energy superpower 100 years or so in the
yoshitaka in addition to waterrelated businesses i believe that                                  future by changing the perspective it is clear that the energy market
thermal and electric power storage are also important business                                      in japan has great potential for growth in the future i would like to
themes japans precision control technologies the intangible                                      see orix group serve as a driving force behind the development of
elements of operations are the most advanced in the world while                                   businesses in these fields
i have heard that europe is more advanced in terms of water treatment                               miyauchi i am acutely aware of the fact that the tasks orix group
technologies japans control technologies are superior therefore                                 must address in the environmental field have increased further the
i feel that japan can leverage this strength in the areas of thermal and                            recent nuclear issues have resulted in the emergence of a number of
electric power storage and battery control the intangible elements of                              differing views with regard to the environment and energy accordingly

  implementation of solar power systems and bulk electric power purchasing services in new condominiums

  orix electric power has begun offering a new service that combines its bulk electric power
  purchasing service with a solar power system this service is currently being offered at lions omori
  nishi grand fort a new daikyo corporation condominium development provision of this service
  allows both energy savings and a further reduction in electricity costs for each unit of the condo
  minium building by supplying electricity generated from the solar power system through the bulk
  electric power purchasing distribution system previously it was common practice for the electricity
  generated from a condominium buildings solar power system to only be used in shared spaces
  within the building due to constraints such as the cost burden of installing electricity distribution
  equipment for individual units however by using a distribution system to supply the electricity to
  each unit in accordance with its floor space orix electric power enables each unit to use electricity
  generated by the solar power system regardless of the total amount generated combined with the
  reductions provided by the bulk electric power purchasing service this allows for more than a 10
  reduction in electricity costs

   orix electric power estimate actual reductions may vary depending on conditions such as the size and scale of the             artistic rendition of lions omori nishi grand fort in ota
    solar panel system the location where it is installed and the number of condominium units                                    ward tokyo the provision of a new service combining the
