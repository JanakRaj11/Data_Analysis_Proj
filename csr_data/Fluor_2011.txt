                                        dear valued stakeholder

                                        i am pleased to report that our company made
                                        considerable headway in implementing sustainability
                                        best practices during 2010 both within our internal
                                        operations as well as on behalf of our hundreds of
                                        clients on projects in a variety of global locations
                                        in the 2009 sustainability report we featured one of our most important relationships the
                                        alignment of our sustainability agenda with those of our clients in that report clients
                                        defined what they expect from us in addressing their sustainability challenges even during a
                                        period of global recession they characterized the application of our experience expertise
                                        and commitment to their sustainability challenges as critical to their success clearly if its
                                        critical to their success its critical to ours  not only to our bottom line but also to meeting
                                        our own sustainability commitment

                                        in this 2010 report we take the next step while defining our progress in a wide range of
                                        areas we illustrate specific ways in which we help our clients meet their sustainability goals for
   david t seaton                      example in 2009 we introduced a companywide fluor sustainability manual  a comprehensive
   chief executive officer              compilation of best practices that integrates sustainability into our own processes and those we
                                        provide to clients on construction projects in this way these practices become more routinely
                                        and consistently a part of daytoday operations

                                        it is our practice to meet with clients and align on sustainability goals and specific steps we will
                                        take to achieve those goals we and our clients find that utilizing such an approach offers clear
                                        benefits and can even be transformative to illustrate this process and the related benefits in
                                        real life terms we feature three project examples in this 2010 report

                                    beyond our project world the year 2010 was also productive in many other ways whether the
                                    aim was to improve our approach to health safety and the environment strengthen corporate
                                    governance further encourage ethical behavior and compliance support our employees while
                                    creating a more effective workplace or increase community and social service we made notable
                                    gains we also observed once again that while there may be differences of opinion regarding
                                    approaches in public policy to global climate change our clients look to us to help them address
                                    this challenge

                                    whether an issue is policy or technicallydriven fluor has built a reputation for creating
                                    and applying innovative solutions to the most difficult problems in 2010 we were productive
                                    in developing innovative technologies that support sustainability objectives alone or with
                                    partners we worked to destroy methanerich gas from landfills and generate power as a
                                    byproduct address water needs in shale gas development demonstrate carbon capture at a

                                    i am particularly proud that fluor continues to be a leader in the elimination or reduction
                                    of corrupt business practices as stakeholders well know fluor was a founder of the world
                                    economic forums wef partnering against corruption initiative paci in 2004 we
                                    continue to provide important leadership to paci as well as to the wefs global agenda
                                    council on corruption in addition i am proud to serve as chair of the forums effort to
                                    provide a global business perspective on corruption to this years meeting of g20 leaders
                                    which is being hosted by france

                                    fluor is also a signatory to the united nations global compact a commitment that i am
                                    pleased to reconfirm we believe that the global compacts 10 principles truly reflect
                                    fluors operating philosophies standards and processes our progress in abiding by these
                                    10 principles is outlined in this stakeholder report

                                    while fluor and others have come far and accomplished much we understand that sustainability
                                    is a marathon not a sprint progress in one area is often followed by new challenges one such
                                    challenge relates to the global utilization of natural resources as we well know countries that
                                    are often the richest in natural resources are sometimes among the poorest economically with
                                    extreme levels of conflict and corruption as growing populations and their drive toward higher
                                    standards of living continue to propel the demand for natural resources we must once again call
                                    upon world leaders to stand strong against the risks inherent in natural resource management in
                                    this regard fluor strongly supports the responsible resource development initiative launched
                                    last year under the auspices of the mineral and mining sector of the wef

   the sustainability committee established biweekly         the sustainability manual and the heightened
   meetings in which members received additional             awareness it brings provides another benefit
   education on sustainability and began identifying        theres a lot of synergy between value awareness
