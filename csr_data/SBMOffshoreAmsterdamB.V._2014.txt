1 overview
11 message from the ceo

by any measure sbm offshore finished 2013 in much better shape than we began the legacy projects
are now largely behind us and the balance sheet is secured as a result we have the focus and financial
flexibility to pursue the projects we wish to win and we are winning them cidade de maric√° and cidade
de saquarema for petrobras together with stones for shell represent our future culturally we are
making critical transitions we are becoming a more client focused organisation

the companys competitive advantage for several decades has been its technological edge especially at the
ever advancing deepwater frontier above all we sell reliability so while maintaining our investment in innovation
was critical in 2013 so was flawless execution and operation our consistent uptime across the fleet of over 99
demonstrates this to be without exception

across the company we expect our teams to start by listening to the client identifying the problem to be solved
and directing their intellectual and engineering efforts to that purpose these behaviours will be critical in the era
our industry is entering

the oilfield services sector faces a structural shift big oil companies and independents alike are under pressure
to reduce expenditure costs are rising while free cash flow is in decline clients are asking service providers to be
more cost effective at the same time national oil companies are increasingly taking the lead responsibility for
ambitious projects and scrutiny of costs despite these trends the attraction of an fpso as a lifeoffield solution
has not diminished the economics remain compelling at around us5 per barrel produced

so what exactly do clients seek in this new era simply put they require reduced capex spend through better
design shorter build or fitout times and reduced operating costs they must of course have a dependable
provider for the entire life of the field  a partnership of between 15 and 25 years this plays to our strengths
great engineering is the key to simpler cheaper better designs we can deliver an fpso and assure our client
that we will be there long term but redesign and reliability do not mean cutting corners we will never bid a price
dependent on upfront cost savings that risk causing problems down the line we will never compromise on builtin
redundancy or systems resilience which ensure uninterrupted production and the strongest safety regime

additionally being equally comfortable with the sale or lease of fpsos the company offers a financing choice
oil companies looking to minimise preproduction costs can opt for lease  operate this is a commercial
advantage for the company both in securing projects and appealing to investors through the downcycle the
companys lease portfolio represents consistent long term cash flow with an average fleet duration of 145 years
providing unrivalled longterm visibility in the oil services sector

the transformational programme begun two years ago made great strides in 2013 i have already referred to our
renewed focus on listening to our customers as a business with an ethical code of conduct we are highly
conscious of our own guidelines in two vital respects the ways we work with clients and the importance of
working within rules this is not merely my impression clients are providing evidence they support our
transparent ways of working also assessment surveys show that our people understand what is required and
why this is a critical element in boosting the pride of those working for sbm offshore




sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                     2

let me address safety our performance has shown a slight yet undeniable deterioration in 2013 this direction
must be reversed but it must also be understood we have pushed rapidly into new geographies and significantly
more complex processes it is essential for us to adapt to these new conditions and learn swiftly which we are
doing

so what is our agenda for 2014 our industry faces different conditions from twelve months ago we can only
take advantage of these circumstances through consistency 2013s standards of quality and delivery need to be
made permanent while we relentlessly drive our productivity forward it will be equally vital to extend our
leadership in technology in the main this will come from our own rd but we may identify opportunities in the
market above all in a changing environment we must keep listening to our clients to propose adapted solutions
we have achieved much and created encouraging momentum i thank all sbm staff for their contribution and
dedication but there is a great deal more to play for

15 corporate strategy
151 introduction
underlying global demand for oil gas and energy will continue to support the companys business model for
decades to come despite the emergence of alternative fuels hydrocarbons are expected to remain the main
energy source through 2040 driven by population growth particularly in regions with increasing standards of living
and urbanisation the expectation that the world population will increase by approximately 2 billion to a total of
around 9 billion individuals by 2040 helps support the notion of strengthened energy demand

the fact that existing producing fields are depleting rapidly while demand is increasing will also contribute to the
companys success oil companies are facing strong pressure to replace reserves and develop proven fields
inducing them to explore opportunities increasingly further offshore in deeper water under more complex
conditions almost 70 of the oil discovered over the past three years have been in deep water these
opportunities most often require highend floating production solutions where the companys main competitive
advantage lies the fact that fpsos are cost competitive solutions including low abandonment costs also adds
to their appeal

however despite strong demand for energy current market developments continue to challenge oil companies
and the company must remain alert with an increasing number deepwater fields to be developed as well as
more complex reservoirs also comes increased technical challenge which has contributed to increasing lead
times between project award and first oil delivery this enhanced technical challenge together with growing
material and human capital input costs have contributed to rising breakeven oil prices and delayed orders for the
fpso industry these market conditions are expected to persist and will thus continue to drive the companys
strategy formulation and execution strong attention is being focused on improving productivity decreasing unit
cost and enhancing riskadjusted returns



152 mediumterm strategic plan 3year plan
the groups updated 3year strategic plan adopted as of december 31 2013 addressed the period from 2014 to
2016 in line with previous years the plan draws on thorough external analysis of the market customers
competitors and technological developments coupled with extensive internal analysis across the companys
activities the management board and the supervisory board have reviewed and approved the plan

the company remains dedicated to its restated focus on core products with good margins these include floating
production and mooring systems production operations as well as terminals and services over the long term the
company continues to see strong potential at the highend of the converted fpso sector supported by a strong
macroeconomic outlook and favourable industryspecific trends mediumterm strategy will therefore be focused
on penetrating the current market more profitably by deploying best practice in terms of reliability talent
management customer value and technology leadership




sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                12

reliability  consistently doing the right thing at the right time
it is the companys ambition to operate and deliver in a safe and reliable manner in terms of hsse quality
compliance and project execution despite increasingly complex dynamics reliability also encapsulates sufficient
financial security to install a sense of trust and confidence amongst our stakeholders in the resilience of our
business model as well as being best placed to exploit growth opportunities



operational excellence
several internal initiatives focusing on improved hsse and compliance in recent years have already started to
deliver results across the organisation even if 2013 hsse statistics themselves have fallen short of internal
expectations the company expects progress to translate into actual shareholder value as new processes and
standards are fully adopted

the execution of the companys transformation programme is expected to contribute significantly to operational
and financial reliability by improving ways of working project control and competencies the programme is
extensive and will be given careful attention across the organisation in the coming years read more about the
transformation programme

in order to facilitate strategic decisionmaking and deliver further management efficiency the company has
simplified its governance structure from three layers comprising the supervisory board management board and
board of management to two by removing the board of management a new position of group executive
managing director has been created reporting to the ceo bernard van leggelo formerly managing director of
the sbm houston execution centre has been appointed to this new role he will focus on the execution of the
companys operational strategy and longterm planning additionally a broad portfolio of responsibilities has been
assigned to the managing directors responsible for the performance of their execution centre all managing
directors will thus report directly to the ceo and have functional reporting lines to the new group executive
managing director

it is the companys intention that these efforts together with previous reorganisational pursuits will continue to
streamline the organisation and enhance transparency ensuring successful delivery and execution of large
complex fpso projects in the future



striving for a balanced portfolio
the company continues to engage both in the lease  operation segment as well as the turnkey sale segment
leasing provides longterm visibility of cash flows and earnings however it is capital intensive and requires tight
management of complex financial operational and contractual risks turnkey sales contracts generate revenues
and profits as the project during the construction phase progresses minimizing capital requirements from the
company balancing both types of activity allows the company continually to improve its track record while
managing its balance sheet exposure and the cyclicality of the industry

an important advantage of the companys business model revolves around the full lifecycle aspects of the
business by leasing and operating its assets the company can feed back its operational knowledge into its
engineering process which allows for continuous improvement and innovation this loop results in further
business opportunities such as relocations vessel refurbishments and other brownfield projects but it also
contributes to an indepth understanding of the effects of age on components better lifecycle costing and asset
integrity management



sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                   13

the fact that the companys activity spans both the lease and turnkey sale segments is an important competitive
advantage for floating production systems it is essentially the clients choice whether to opt for lease or
purchase which decision is often taken relatively late in the contracting process however it is the overall risk
profile of each project which determines the riskreward balance for the company and influences the appetite for
exposing its balance sheet

the company aims to grow primarily through the organic growth of its lease fleet of fpsos but may consider
acquisition opportunities that match its financial operation and strategic criteria the company aims to maintain
its leadership in brazil and angola but simultaneously aims to secure new suitable projects in geographical
areas such as the far east australia north sea mexico and west africa to diversify its geographic spread
while also keeping its highend positioning



better risk  reward balance
with increasing complexity and technical risk characterising the market recent riskadjusted returns in the fpso
sector have proved unsustainable and a call for a more appropriate riskreward profile it therefore remains a main
objective for the company to grow selectively and lead the industry in improving the risk and reward balance
the fact that the company remains the largest and most experienced player in a niche market with high barriers
to entry should allow the company to become increasingly selective in its bidding policy additionally the
company has initiated a review of countryspecific risk exposure and set its risk appetite

more specifically the company intends to achieve a better riskreward balance by continuing its dialogue with
clients on risksharing and only tendering for fpso projects that meet its stringent riskreturn profile ultimately
the companys risk appetite and risk management will be inextricably linked with its strategy



partnerships
entering into partnerships will contribute to the companys ability to finance continued growth of its lease fleet as
well as in developing the local content component of fpso projects

current key commercial partners include sonangol misc qgog and gepetrol key financial partners include
mitsubishi corporation nyk and itochu key technical partners include dsme and synergy key technology
partners include linde ivanhoe energy and compactgtl longterm equity alliances are becoming particularly
important as the scale and capital requirements of future projects increase

the company will continue to enter into partnerships in order to improve its chances of securing new business
and add value to its performance in the long run



divestment of noncore activities
in line with the focused strategy around fpsos the company has continued its divestment of noncore assets
throughout the year

the sale and leaseback of a part of the companys monaco office portfolio has progressed with sale and lease
back transactions completed for two of three buildings the remaining building is now expected to be sold in
2014 sales proceeds thus far exceed us100 million resulting in a book profit of us27 million

the sale of the dscv sbm installer a new build diving support and construction vessel will be pursued during

talent management  growing talent in order to grow our company
the company operates in a market where competition for increasingly scarce talent is fierce it therefore remains
a significant priority for the company to focus on talent development in order to secure the necessary skills and
capabilities for the future and maintain its technology leadership consequently numerous internal initiatives
have been progressed and continue to be initiated in order to fulfill the companys ambition to become an
excellent training ground for newly educated engineers and other graduates as well as for more senior people
within the organisation for example the company implemented a customised leadership and management
development lmd programme and a middle management development programme mdp additionally efforts
have been and continue to be targeted at improving succession planning and mobility schemes read more
about talent management



customer centricity  valuing customers to build value
throughout the year efforts have been targeted at improving organisational structures and procedures guiding
how the company engages with clients in order to establish best possible collaboration and value creation for
everyone involved amongst others a new client management process system has been formalised with
assigned gates and responsibilities to ensure the most effective interaction furthermore the company has
organised client technology days a forum for client alignment and discussion on technology trends and
opportunities the purpose of these is to focus on value creation and improve commerciality and competitive
advantage

as implementation proceeds the company expects considerable benefits to be reaped from these initiatives
particularly in terms of project execution operational excellence and technology insight additionally it remains
the companys belief that improved client interaction will contribute to greater alignment of views on the
appropriate riskreward balance in a manner beneficial to the company and its stakeholders



technology leadership  defining the market instead of being
defined
the company has an outstanding reputation as a technology leader for large and complex fpsos as well as
turrets and mooring systems on which the company continues to build to maintain this leading position the

greater focus within the company on the socalled three lines of defence

     captured in the companys general management system gms and the manner in which the line managers incorporate
     these in the performance of their duties and responsibilities


   the second line of defence is formed by the functions that have as their primary task to assist in the rollout and
     observation of all that is contained in gms and other applicable laws rules and regulations functions such as hsse and
     quality control but also group financial control risk and compliance play an important role in ensuring best practice in
     each of their respective disciplines


   internal audit is the group function that is mostly engaged in the third line of defence activities through the audits that are
     part of the annual audit plan and any specific audit undertaken as circumstances require internal audit investigates
     whether activities performed have been carried out in compliance with the relevant external and internal applicable
     standards


internal audits regular reports to the audit committee ensure that the highest levels of management in the
company are made aware of the general condition of assurance

23 remuneration report
dear shareholders

 as chairman of the appointment and remuneration committee arc dealing with remuneration matters i
am pleased to present you this remuneration report



231 remuneration of the management board
in 2010 the arc conducted a detailed review of the remuneration policy 2008 to ensure continued alignment
with the companys strategic priorities remuneration principles external market developments and best
practices based on the outcome of this evaluation a new remuneration policy rp2011 was designed at the
annual general meeting agm of shareholders dated 5 may 2011 rp 2011 was adopted for a detailed
description of rp2011 reference is made to the 2011 annual report pages 3541

rp2011 was then amended at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders egm held on 27 june 2012
by the adoption of rp2011aa aa connoting as amended the amendments in rp2011aa were specifically
designed to overcome the rigidity of the variable remuneration parameters of rp2011 which was an impediment
to the appropriate remuneration of a new management board all of who were appointed in the course of 2012
and who faced the challenging task of achieving a turnaround of the company for a detailed description of
rp2011aa reference is made to the 2012 annual report pages 3436

rp2011aa applies to the board of management which consisted of the management board being the ceo the
cfo and the cgco as statutory directors plus the coo until his dismissal on 7 november 2013 and the cto
until the revision of the senior management structure on 3 december 2013 as nonstatutory directors disclosure
of the remuneration was and will remain limited to the remuneration of the management board members going
forward and with the discontinuation of the board of management committee on 3 december 2013 rp2011aa for
the remainder of its term and rp2015 will apply to the management board members only being the statutory
directors of the company

the arc has recognised that it would be inappropriate to retain certain of the measures that were introduced in
rp2011aa such as the special incentive after the end of the turnaround period as those were designed to
govern the turnaround years of 2012 2013 and 2014 following the positive resolution of a number of the
companys legacy project issues and the successful strengthening of the companys statement of financial
position through a private placement of 995 new shares to hal investments bv on 20 december 2012 and
the 10 rights offering of new ordinary shares of 3 april 2013 it is expected that the turnaround will be largely
completed by the start of 2015 accordingly the arc decided that it will be necessary to revise rp2011aa with
the aim to develop a robust sustainable remuneration policy for 2015 and beyond to be called rp2015
shareholders approval of the rp 2015 will be sought at the agm of 17 april 2014

consultant to carry out a remuneration benchmarking study this study showed that the base salary of the ceo
was not compliant with the rp2011aa principle of remunerating at the median of the peer group and required an
increasethe arc recommended raising the ceos base salary from 677200 pa to 800000 pa effective 1
july 2013 and the supervisory board endorsed this recommendation

csr multiplier

in its business plan and performance objectives the management board has specific operational health safety
security and environment hsse objectives as mentioned at the egm of 27 june 2012 however due to the
urgency and priority of achieving the operational and financial business objectives of the company no other
specific csr objectives were set for the purpose of the csr multiplier in 2012 since the csr multiplier is
calculated as a multiple of the company performance element that in 2012 was nil the csr multiplier outcome
was equally nil despite a marked improvement in hsse performance

hsse performance in the year 2013 was assessed and the supervisory board on advice of the arc scored
the csr multiplier at 100 consequently this score does not modify the sti payable in 2014 on account of
performance in 2013

at the start of each year performance shares are conditionally awarded at the target level of base salary the
target number of performance shares conditionally awarded is determined by dividing the lti target opportunity
outlined in the table above by the average closing price of the company shares over the five trading days
following the date of publication of the final results for the previous financial year at the end of the threeyear
performance period performance against agreed targets is assessed and scored by the supervisory board acting
upon the recommendation of the arc and the target number of performance shares is adjusted upwards or
downwards based on that assessment to arrive at the final number of shares awarded

in 2013 following the successful rights issue in april in accordance with the lti performance share regulations
which are posted on the company website the arc recommended and the supervisory board endorsed
increasing the number of conditionally awarded shares by 19187 being the theoretical ex rights price
correction factor as applied by euronext amsterdam for the adjustment of derivatives pursuant to the nyse
euronext corporate actions policy for the euronext derivatives markets

the total remuneration of the members of the supervisory board amounted to  567000 2012  615000 for
the individual remuneration please refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements reported in us
these amounts are gross ie before tax amounts per year

the supervisory board and subcommittee fee levels are to be reviewed every second year a review was due to
be carried out in 2012 but the supervisory board on the advice of the arc concluded that it would not be
appropriate to revise supervisory board remuneration at that time in 2014 the arc has with the assistance of
its own remuneration consultant and other advisors reviewed the existing fee levels led by the consideration that
the supervisory board will only be in a position to fulfill the demands of its tasks if its approach to supervisory
board work is commensurate with todays broad and global requirements for which it needs to attract
internationally oriented qualified and expert persons this review recognized that the level of remuneration on
offer must be such that the company remains competitive in recruiting in the relevant international market the
existing fees which have remained unchanged since the egm of 2010 were benchmarked against supervisory
board and committee fees at aex companies and at relevant international companies and were compared with
the current market trends based on this work it was concluded that certain changes are required and a
proposal to that effect will be submitted at the agm of 2015

i am looking forward to answering any questions which may arise from this report at the agm of 17 april 2014

yours faithfully

3 report of the management board
31 report of the management board  introduction
2013 was a year of significant achievements for the company during the early months the company
successfully resolved challenging legacy issues and significantly strengthened its financial position within the
operations the reconfiguration of resources around an exclusively fpsoled strategy has renewed the
companys sense of purpose these gains taken together have paved the way for securing an increasing share of
highend technologically complex projects

in a decisive move to remedy outstanding legacy issues the company reached final agreement with talisman
                                              tm
energy to decommission the yme mopustor platform for a settlement by the company of us470 million in
march this contribution covered the termination of existing agreements and arbitration procedures and the
decommissioning of the platform as the company had already taken a provision of us200 million for
decommissioning costs in december 2012 the balance of us270 million was recognised in the first half of 2013
with the total cash settlement of us470 million paid to talisman during the first quarter

responsibility for decommissioning and bargeloading the platform now falls to talisman to be completed no
later than 2016 the company will take charge of transporting the platform to a yard for scrapping

following several months of installation works to safely bring the platform to full production capacity the deep
panuke platform was commissioned in december prompting production acceptance and the start of the lease
contract

meanwhile the internal investigation into potentially improper sales practices announced in the second quarter
2012 is ongoing the company is in active dialogue with the relevant authorities

the companys financial position was significantly strengthened in april following a successful 1 for 10 rights
offering of which 977 was taken up by existing shareholders and the remainder subscribed and paid for by
hal investments bv raising us247 million in total

the company had also received an additional payment of us27 million from hal as a result of the announced
settlement with talisman this was paid in cash as a share premium contribution on the shares hal acquired
through a private placement in december 2012 according to a preagreed formula

raising capital in this manner was complemented by the noncore asset disposal programme which continued
during 2013 in line with group strategy in december 2013 the company reported a sale and lease back
transaction and a sale and purchase agreement for two of three office buildings it owns in monaco the remaining
building is now expected to be sold in 2014 sales proceeds thus far exceed us100 million resulting in a book
profit of us27 million this process followed the sale and licence of the cool hose technology assets

the company continued to make progress in the strategic pursuit of the larger more complex production
facilities which clients are increasingly demanding in july the company announced the finalisation of two twenty
year charter and operation contracts for new fpsos cidade de maric√° and cidade de saquarema for petrobras
both fpsos are destined for the lula field in the presalt province offshore brazil and will follow the blueprint
provided by fpso cidade de ilhabela scheduled for launch next year

in addition maric√° and saquarema will benefit from the technological expertise and experience acquired during

the completion of fpso cidade de paraty  the first of sbm offshores stateoftheart presalt fpsos to start
production offshore brazil planned delivery for the two fpsos is expected by end of 2015 and early 2016
respectively

project in the gulf of mexico the deepest oil and gas development in the world delivery is expected in first half of
2016 the contract envisages an initial ten year lease with extension options up to twenty years

introduced by ifrs finance lease accounting



311 riskreward balance
during 2013 the company has taken steps to improve the riskreward balance in the provision of fpsos
historically this has been a challenge for the entire industry but with the escalation of value and complexity in
fpsos in recent years tackling this issue has become imperative naturally improving this balance must be
achieved while preserving and protecting value for the client and the company has consulted extensively with its
customers

an important first step in this respect has been to focus attention across the industry on improving and
regularising standard terms for fpso contracts within the company there has been a close focus on disciplined
tendering procedures and identifying the niche opportunities where the company brings to bear its leading edge
expertise and avoids competing as a commodity provider for clients the company has focused on service
excellence in particular on maximising uptime at levels above 99



312 focus on high end segment of the converted fpso market
over the course of 2013 the company continued to reshape its project management capabilities and invest in
operational development to accommodate the increasingly complex largescale fpso projects this resulted in
the successful execution of a number of significant conversion project awards


      the twentyyear charter and operation of the two fpsos cidade de maric√° and cidade de saquarema for petrobras
       jointly this was the largest project award in companys history read more about maric√° and saquarema

313 directional reporting
in june 2013 the company introduced the directional reporting methodology in addition to ifrs to provide
greater transparency of the underlying business performance the new reporting method enabled a nonifrs
operating lease presentation of company results more in line with operating cash flows and was included
alongside accounts presented under international financial reporting standards ifrs

this change was driven by two factors firstly the ifrs concept of finance lease accounting causes significant
disparity between cash flow and revenue recognition secondly the companys business model which combines
turnkey sales construction and lease and operate projects means that the company builds fpsos that it puts in
its own lease and operate portfolio adding a layer of complexity in respect of the ifrs concept of finance lease
accounting ifrs rules applied to the companys business model result in an accelerated recognition of
revenues profit and equity in advance of any rents paid by client

2013 has been an important year in demonstrating and promoting the understanding of directional reporting as
the primary indicator for company performance and analysis directional reporting will continue to be a regular
disclosure feature complementing ifrs reporting for 2014 the companys guidance will be based on
directional results the management believes that these disclosures allow for a level playing field when investors
compare the company with other services companies in the oil and gas sector

introduction on ifrs 10  11 standards and directional reporting

ifrs 10  11 standards will be introduced in 2014

it implies for the company discontinuation of proportional accounting of joint ventures jvs to be replaced by


   full consolidation of controlled jvs mainly brazilian ventures
   equity accounting of jointly controlled jvs mainly african ventures

these changes will chiefly impact the balance sheet where the relatively young brazilian fleet increases the size
of the asset base and loan portfolio only partially offset by the deconsolidation of the african assets and loans

the changes in ifrs will not affect the calculation method under the companys loan covenants as the loan
agreements stipulate the correction back to the old standards in case of changes

also applying new ifrs 10  11 under directional reporting to the project portfolio removes the revenue the
company generates during the project phase from its jvs partners from the income statement the effect is to
grossly understate the operating cash flow and thereby invalidate the concepts of directional reporting which is
cash based

consequently directional reporting from 2014 onwards will


   classify all leases as operating leases as before
   treat all production facilities on a proportional accounting basis

as a consequence directional revenue and results will only be marginally impacted by the ifrs 10  11

332 fpso technology
sbm offshore positions itself at the premium end of the leased fpso market focusing on the largest and most
complex projects over the years the complexity of the companys fpso fleet has grown significantly and
generation 3 fpsos now represent the core of new business activity

the company has developed an optimised and cost effective design for the generation 3 fpsos which are
needed to produce the presalt fields in brazil in ultradeep water conditions these units require extensive gas
                                                                2
conditioning systems including gas phase membranes for co removal together with large gas and carbon
dioxide compression plants for gas reinjection at very high pressure

the company is building a series of four of these complex fpsos for charter to petrobras the first unit
successfully entered service during 2013 with three more under construction when complete these vessels will
                                                                          3
be able to produce 570000 bpd in aggregate and compress 22 million nm d 775mmscfd of gas



333 mooring system  riser technology
the company is recognised as the world leader in complex mooring systems throughout 2013 the company
has continued to develop its mooring technology to retain and strengthen this position

the companys largest ever internal turret mooring system for the shell prelude flng is currently under
construction two further complex turrets are also underway for the ichthys fpso and the quad 204 fpso all of
these projects have very high mooring loads and benefit from the companys proprietary technology for turret
bearing systems and fluid swivels

the fpso stones project for shell in the gulf of mexico represents a significant step change in terms of
disconnectable mooring systems this project will achieve a number of industry firsts the first disconnectable
fpso with steel risers the deepest production facility in the world at 2900m water depth and the largest ever
disconnectable mooring buoy




sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                        64

this highly complex turret mooring system has been made possible by extensive development work in recent
years in particular two components have recently completed qualification testing a high capacity locking
mechanism for use with disconnectable turret moorings and an inline mooring connector ilmc improving
offshore safety by avoiding the need for divers

the companys laboratory located in france is dedicated to the rigorous testing and qualification of advanced
fluid swivels swivel sealing systems and mooring components many of these represent significant advances in
the industry by expanding the allowable operating envelope of turret mooring systems

a new fluid swivel design for ultrahigh pressure applications designed to allow reinjection of gas and water into
high pressure ultradeep reservoirs such as the lower tertiary of the gulf of mexico has completed a rigorous
qualification test programme in the companys laboratory and is now marketready

the growing trends for production operations in ultradeep water fields and high pressurehigh temperature
fields has increased the industry focus on steel riser systems as an alternative to unbonded flexible risers or
hybrid riser towers the companys fpso espirito santo is the worlds first turret moored fpso to be equipped
with steel risers and has now successfully completed over four years of service the company continues to
develop an enhanced version of this turret design with capacity for a greater number of steel risers in ultradeep
water conditions



334 other floating production units
                                                                                                            tm
the company continued to develop its dry tree configuration of the proven deep draft semisubmersible hull in
order to allow the use of surfacemounted christmas trees in ultradeep water fields in brazil and the gulf of
mexico development work is progressing well with further model basin testing performed during 2013 to refine
the conceptual design

this new product has the potential to overcome the inherent water depth limitation of tlp platforms which are
limited by tendon cost and consequently offers great potential for ultradeep water fields especially for high
pressurehigh temperature reservoirs where dry trees may be preferred

as part of the continued development of this dry tree semi the company has identified and has a patent
                                                                                                   tm

lower investment than required for other concepts currently on the market

the company has a commercial development agreement with uk based compactgtl ltd the pioneer of
modular gastoliquid solutions to work exclusively together on offshore projects the use of gtl technology
significantly reduces gas flaring by transforming associated gas into synthetic crude oil which can be blended in
to the produced crude oil this product continues to be developed jointly with compactgtl and is being actively
marketed to clients



336 intellectual property
the company maintains a significant intellectual property ip portfolio including patents trademarks and
copyrights the companys extensive patent portfolio of over 200 patent families covers a wide range of items
including fpso mooring and turret systems hydrocarbon transfer and processing systems including lng and
gas processing drilling and riser technologies and offshore installation during 2013 the company was granted
60 new patents in different countries the company also filed over 20 applications for new patents



337 technical standards
in 2003 the company introduced a set of proprietary technical standards which defined design procurement
construction commission and installation processes for fpso products these have continued to evolve over the
past decade adopting the accumulated learnings from project execution and fleet operation today the
standards are unique in being the only set of fpsospecific technical specifications in the offshore industry
capturing the accumulated experience from over 200 years of fpso operations they provide a valuable
foundation for the companys leased fpso projects

the company has now put in place a system of technical authorities to continue the development of these
standards and to ensure that they are correctly applied on our projects

34 risk management
341 process and activities
introduction

the company recognises that efficient and effective risk management throughout its business and support
activities must be a prioritised strategic objective

the company has developed governance risk and compliance systems following the general principles and
recommendation of iso 31000

the company also recognises the importance of regular review and ongoing improvement of its risk
management processes

risk management policy

the companys risk management principles are defined in a group policy which is part of sbm offshores group
management system

the pyramid below represents the different levels of the company operational management and supervisory
board demonstrating how risk management is enforced across the company with clear accountability

all individuals within the company are fully accountable for the management of risks  opportunities ro
within their respective areas of responsibility at project department business area and group level ro is
tracked and managed by the respective authority




sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                             67

the process cycle risk  opportunity circle illustrates the complete process of risk management commencing
with identification and spanning assessment response monitoring and reporting




sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                         67

this process has been made applicable across every level of the business

developments during 2013

structure
the reporting structure that was put in place in 2012 remains unchanged with the group risk officer reporting to
the chief governance and compliance officer cgco

risk team
in 2013 the group risk team focused on training and developing the methodologies that were previously put in
place to ensure uniform understanding and adoption across the business with the objective of propagating the
appropriate culture

risk network
at execution centre level risk management responsibilities have been assigned to the finance manager he will
support each managing director in their relevant execution centre in in the management of ro however for the
fleet operation execution centre sbm operations a dedicated risk manager supports the ro processes
across the whole fleet in addition on some major projects a full time dedicated risk delegate has been
assigned to assist the project manager

engineering and construction risk institute
the company is now a recognised member of the engineering and construction risk institute ecri this gives
the company access to industry best practice training and peer networking in relation to risk management this



sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                           68

allows the company continuously to improve its approach to risk through a combination of presentations of the
sbm risk framework regular attendance to ecri sponsor meetings risk maturity surveys or other activities
facilitated by the institute all contribute to continuous improvement training sessions organised by ecri are
regularly attended by company personnel across all execution centres to reinforce the culture and knowledge of
risk management

procedures
the processes developed to ensure consistent and systematic application of risk and opportunity management
activities across the company have now been tested formalised and progressively implemented within the
framework of the group management system some outstanding procedures and work instructions are under
finalisation and will be issued by the end of the first quarter of 2014

group risk matrix
a standardised risk matrix has been developed and is now enforced within the company across all disciplines
and activities




the purpose is to ensure a consistent and systematic approach to any risk assessment that is performed in the
company

the matrix is divided into 3 different areas green orange and dark orange areas to translate the risk tolerance
level onto the matrix
 green continuous improvement can require the implementation of risk response



sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                69

 orange reduce risk should require the implementation of risk response
 dark orange intolerable must require the implementation of risk response immediately

severity and likelihood thresholds have been defined for different activities eg health  safety environment
security reputation information technology capex schedule opex and constitute general guidelines to
allow a qualitative assessment rather than firm a prescriptive limit

risk appetite
in order to ensure maximum effectiveness the groups risk appetite framework has been defined in line with sbm
offshores threeyear strategic plan the groups risk appetite and associated thresholds are revised once a year
the management board defines the risk appetite of the company ie the level of risk that the company should
take to achieve its objectives and reviews regularly the group risk profile as reported




execution centre and group function risk review
reviews of individual execution centre and group function reviews are now performed on a quarterly basis by the
group risk management team together with the management teams

they aim to identify assess address and monitor risks and opportunities ro and their associated response
strategies within each execution centre or group function the output of such review is a detailed risk register and
matrix illustrating the top risks and opportunities

quantitative and qualitative risk analysis
the group risk management team has developed and implemented a methodology to quantify the impact of risks
which shall be included in an estimate at tender stage and managed throughout a project execution this is



sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                70

based on the statistical monte carlo method the forecasts produced from these simulations help to quantify
exposure to risk reducing uncertainties and establishing with the proposal and project control team the
appropriate contingency levels to be maintained during project execution

risk aggregation
all risks identified throughout the groups activities are aggregated and classified in terms of impact and
probability in order to maintain a global overview of the group risk profile

risk registers are updated on a regular basis for each proposal and project and major risks and opportunities are
reported through the weekly and monthly reports and dashboard to the management team similar reports are
generated for each of the fleet units

for all risk reporting specific key performance indicators as well as key risks indicators are being progressively
developed and implemented

reporting

the outcome is a quarterly ro report which covers proposal projects and fleet individual risks as well as group
functions and execution centres and is made available to the management board and supervisory board the
ro report provides an overview of the top 10 risks and top 10 opportunities as well as the latest risk profile
versus the defined risk appetite status to the management board and supervisory board

developments for 2014

risk appetite
the risk appetite will be revisited on an annual basis to align with the group strategy but the actual status of the
group risk profile versus its appetite will continue to be reported on a quarterly basis

business continuity
a plan to review update test and maintain the existing business continuity plans in a more comprehensive and
integrated manner will be proposed to the management board and is to be implemented in 2014

finalise risk processes within group management system
any outstanding work instructions will be finalised and issued and where necessary previous procedures will be
updated to reflect continuous improvements changes and feedback

governance risk and compliance grc
the group risk team is actively involved and aligned with odyssey 24 sbm offshores transformation
programme particularly in relation to the governance risk and compliance work stream and will participate in the
development of the associated framework and tools

communication
a regular series of risk road shows will continue to inform managers and leaders in the main construction sites
shore bases and selected units of the fleet

training
risk related training of staff across the company will continue in various forms including through the groups
membership of the ecri external training sessions in specialist areas such as schedule risk analysis and
quantitative tools and internal training

ecri review  audit
it is foreseen to use the services of ecri to conduct an external audit of sbm risk management framework in
order to identify areas of improvements

risk profile

the risks inherent in the companys core business activities did not change substantially during 2013 although a
number of new risks were identified and ranked as shown in qualitative assessment matrix below these include

  1 the potential costs of environmental pollution following events in the gulf of mexico have resulted in a tendency for the
    companys clients to try to allocate more potential liabilities for pollution to the company in general the trend towards
    tougher contractual requirements has continued during 2013
  2 the ongoing compliance investigation into potentially improper sales practices may expose the company to the risk of
    penalties or fines
  3 the company is exposed to the industry wide risk overall shortage of competencies in the total range of skills required in
    the companys activities
  4 a strong focus on asset integrity aims at improving long term overall fleet safety and performance
  5 transforming the company may create uncertainty for some employees and may lead to detract their attention from
    assisting in delivery of the companys objectives




the general nature of the risk categories confronting the company and the way in which these are managed are
explained below

safety results

sbm offshore operations

the fleet of fpsos recorded an increase in its trifr in 2013 081 compared to 071 in 2012 and its lost time
incident frequency rate ltifr 017 in 2013 compared to 008 in 2012

during 2013 a series of new initiatives has been put in place to emphasise management system compliance and
enhance dynamic risk awareness and behaviours

the length of operating time achieved without recordable incidents provides a good indicator of safety
performance throughout the industry in 2013 the offshore fleet was awarded eight safety milestone certificates
for recordable incidentfree periods with one offshore unit the fpso saxi batuque in angola achieving four
years recordable incidentfree

as part of its drive for continuous improvement sbm offshore operations has attained compliance recognition by
abs on a voluntary basis for occupational health and safety assessment series ohsas 18001 following a
successful implementation of the standard in brazilian shore bases in 2009 and onboard fpsos managed from
brazil in 2010 the process continued in angola and for the rest of the world fleet in 2011 and 2012

for further information see the compliance table in part 17 group management systems and compliance table
compliance to the mandatory international safety management ism standard and the international ship and
port facility security isps code remains the cornerstone for effective fleet management across the company

onshore projects

all construction yards undertaking work for the company provide the company with details of their safety records
to support its reporting requirements in this area

in 2013 the onshore operations recorded a stable performance in its total recordable incident frequency rate
trifr 031 compared to 032 in 2012 while the lost time incident frequency rate ltifr has increased to
012 compared to 006 in 2012

despite solid performance on a number of yards and projects the companys overall safety performance has
been impacted in 2013 by the challenges in safe working practices on one of its projects

following the deteriorating performance on this project sbm launched several initiatives aimed at improving
safety onsite including


   increased number of safety resources
   improvement and strengthening of the permit to work system used

following the launch in 2012 of a structured programme to address the improvement areas in process safety
management psm the company has further developed a framework and associated tools for implementation of
a comprehensive psm programme based on a wellestablished industry standard guidelines for risk based
process safety by the center for chemical process safety ccps part of the american institute for chemical
engineers aiche

when applied throughout the lifecycle of sbm products the twenty framework elements have the potential to
reduce the risk of catastrophic events with the ultimate aim of minimising these risks on any of its facilities
worldwide

the implementation of the psm framework will be through the group management system to ensure that the
process safety management controls are fully integrated in the sbm business activities and processes



354 security management
ensuring the security of employees wherever they work is a key priority for managers and supervisors throughout
the company the groups security policy procedures and controls are intended to protect its employees
wherever they operate in the world

in those areas of the world identified as high risk risk assessments are always completed before construction
contracts for offshore units managed by the company commence in addition the groups security manager
monitors global security issues for onshore and offshore operations daily security reports are issued throughout
the year to all sbm sites and operations as well as daily threat analysis for personnel operating in high risk
locations security alerts are issued when applicable

the company recognises its duty of care to employees and contractors on security matters relevant security
information is being compiled and distributed from security information suppliers as well as through network of
security contacts this is particularly important when the company vessels are operating in areas assessed as a
high risk location

to support the above facetoface security briefings as well as security awareness training were delivered in
2013 to project personnel traveling to locations with specific security threats

offshore operations

across the lease fleet the isps international ship  port facility security code is used as the basis of a system
that safeguards personnel onboard and provides overall protection for all company facilities during 2013
security drills exercises and audits were carried out to ensure that the procedures in place to deal with offshore
incidents were comprehensive fit for purpose and regularly tested these exercises were particularly relevant for
an offshore project in nigeria where the company completed the brass buoy changeout the company has
operated in high risk areas of nigeria for a period of more than six years without security incidents involving sbm
personnel or assets

transit risk assessments were carried out for the company offshore units transiting the indian ocean either
going to their operating field or returning from the field to a construction yard in china security training was also
carried out onboard an fpso in china prior to sailaway

company security officers provide advice on security to the operating fleet focusing their efforts on three main
operating areas angola brazil and the rest of the world




onshore projects

certain countries in which the company operates are designated as high risk with respect to personnel security

throughout 2013 the company maintained a particular focus on the security aspects of travel between all
locations in which it operates it continued to deploy isoscontrol risks for travel security services to monitor
all employee business travel security and to establish appropriate procedures for evacuation including medevac

support if necessary and give the appropriate briefings

country evacuation plans have been developed for various countries the programme has been extended to
equatorial guinea and china for 2013




355 environmental management
the company endeavours to operate on its own behalf and on behalf of its clients in an environmentally
sustainable way in order to minimise damage to local ecosystems

the company pays particular attention to three key environmental challenges


   avoiding oil spills
   preventing unnecessary flaring or emissions to sea or air
   minimising the use of energy and waste outputs by encouraging reduced consumption and reuse

the ambitious plan of the company to bring its entire fleet into compliance with iso 14001 was achieved in early
2013 with the accreditation of the fpso cidade de anchieta all the fpso units are now compliant with the iso
14001 standards

during 2013 the company has aligned its environmental performance reporting with the reporting guidelines
from the international association of oil  gas producers 2 as a consequence the company reports additional
environmental related performance data and has decided to group fleet data by region the 2012 data have been
reported accordingly by region as well for comparison purposes




sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                           80

emissions to air

the primary emissions from the offshore fleet are greenhouse gases ghg caused by energy generation and
flaring

during production of oil and natural gas the most significant components of produced ghg are carbon dioxide
co2 and methane ch4

emissions reported in the companys emissions records include


   ghg emissions for the production of energy records ghg emissions from steam boilers gas turbines and diesel
     engines used by the operating units
   ghg emissions from gas flared records of the volume of gas flared attributable to sbm account andor attributable to the
     client account


the records of gas flared include the volume of emissions below the limit defined by the client and the volume of
emissions above the limit attributable to sbm account or at the request of the client to optimise production

emissions reported do not take into account any fugitive emissions nor emissions from cargo tank venting

in general the overall ghg emissions from energy generation and gas flared increased by 9  in comparison to
2012 but still remain 9 below the ogp average 159 tonnes of ghg per thousand tonnes of hydrocarbon
produced 3

the total gas flared in 2013 was 184 tonnes of gas flared per thousand tonnes of hydrocarbons produced 17
above the ogp average 157 tonnes of gas flared per thousand tonnes of hydrocarbon produced 4 with 37
of the gas flared recorded on sbm account and 63 on client account for production optimisation or not
exceeding the client allowance

the high level of gas flared in 2013 is mainly due to startup of two new oil production units in canada deep
panuke and brazil fpso cidade de paraty which typically flare a substantial amount of gas during this phase
as systems are being tested and commissioned with hydrocarbons once production is stabilised emissions levels
will drop as these systems have been designed to produce without flaring gas unless for safety reasons

energy consumption

the energy used to produce oil and gas covers a range of activities including


   driving pumps producing the hydrocarbons or reinjecting produced water
   heating produced oil for separation
   producing steam
   powering compressors to reinject produced gas
   driving turbines to generate electricity needed for operational activities

the main source of energy consumption of offshore units is fuel gas and marine gas oil

energy consumption of the company units was 33  better in 2013 than the ogp average 157 gigajoules of
energy per tonnes of hydrocarbon produced in 20125

oil in produced water discharges

produced water is a high volume liquid discharge generated during the production of oil and gas after extraction
produced water is separated and treated deoiled before discharge to surface water

the quality of produced water is most widely expressed in terms of its oil content limits are imposed on the
concentration of oil in the effluent discharge stream generally expressed in the range of 1530 ppm or discharge
is limited where reinjection is permitted back into the reservoir the overall efficiency of the oil in water treatment
and as applicable reinjection can be expressed as tonnes of oil discharged per million tonnes of hydrocarbon
produced

the companys result has been stable as compared to 2012 in 2013 the average volume of oil discharged was
398 tonnes of oil discharged to sea per million tonnes of hydrocarbon production which represents less than half
of the ogp average 88 tonnes of oil discharged per million tonnes of hydrocarbon production in 20126

environmental releases

in 2013 the offshore operations fleet reported 37 environmental incidents 33 of which were contained within the
offshore unit with no release to the sea while the remaining 4 resulted in releases to the sea

total volume of these releases to the sea is estimated to 0019 cubic meters for 2013 compared to 0076 cubic
meters in 2012

for offshore operations there were no spills recorded in the category of reportable spills in accordance with the
ogp guidelines ie above 1 barrel  159 litres

waste

in 2013 the company has improved its environmental reporting with the consolidation of the volume of waste
produced on all its offshore units

total volume of waste generated by the operating units was 2340 tonnes in 2013 of which 46  was
nonrestricted waste

363 training  development
the company encourages an environment of development and empowerment enabling each staff member to
contribute hisher skills and talents towards sustaining high performance and achieving rewards and recognition

in these times of increasingly complex projects and technical challenges when the competition for the best
energy industry talent is more intense than ever it is the companys aim to develop from within and retain the
inhouse and technical knowhow for which the company is renowned and which remains a key asset

over recent years a series of programmes have been implemented within the framework of the talent
management and succession planning process thereby building the foundations for the companys continued
success

the global and local people reviews take place on a yearly basis and help tthe company ensure that it has the
necessary successors ready for key positions

in 2011 the company implemented a customised leadership and management development lmd programme
with the objective of building a common leadership and management culture and reinforcing these skills
throughout the company 153 participants have attended the lmd since 2011

in parallel 2012 saw the launching of a middle management development programme mdp that embodies the
companys ambitions and is inspired by the lmd scheduled over a total of 6 days it focuses on the following key
skills open communication and organisational buyin driving results building and leading teams decisionmaking
and problemsolving and crossborder collaboration a total of 215 participants have attended the mdp since
september 2012

a mentoring process has also been developed within the framework of these programmes with the objective of
solidly anchoring the company management competencies and behaviours across the company this personal
learning contract includes a 360 survey for the participant the mentee generating 3 strong points and 3 points
for improvement the mentor and the mentee then jointly define development objectives and implement actions
derived from the programme culminating in a final individual development plan discussion following their active
participation attendees become mentors for future participants in order to guide and challenge them throughout
the process as well as provide continued support beyond the end of the training

two new programmes have been designed over the course of 2013 including one dedicated to the discipline
lead engineers and a projectunit management programme

both programmes are scheduled for a companywide rollout in 2014

in addition the company continues to offer international career opportunities to a significant number of
employees to enhance their experience within the company and contribute to the work as one strategic goal

finally a company induction path has been developed for all newcomers it is available on the companys
intranet system

additionally the company provides a wide range of training and development opportunities to enhance the skills
of its employees in all locations worldwide a total of 7350 permanent employees took part in 22054 courses
which amounted to a total of 306555 training hours over the course of 2013

onshore staff

training policy is closely aligned with the companys objectives and strategy in addition to group programmes
that are provided the need for training and development is also discussed during the annual performance
appraisal sessions between employees and managers resulting in individual training plans

training provided by the company covers both inhouse training sessions which are performed by the
companys staff or consultants and external training which is performed outside the company by specialised
training providers

the majority of training courses are around technical and hsse topics including technical and scientific software
use over the last few years focus has been given to managerial and leadership training with the development of
the groups programmes in addition to individual training courses

offshore staff

given the significant technical and safety requirements of the operations onboard the company considers
onthejob training distance learning and external courses to be of utmost importance for all its offshore
personnel whether employed on a permanent or contract basis

hsse topics and safety in particular represent the vast majority of training courses that are provided to
companys offshore staff

in addition to the above specific programmes have been rolledout in 2012 such as management and
communications training for oims offshore installation managers and superintendents and supervisory skills
training for supervisors and people moving to a supervisory positionthe company has an obvious and extensive
commitment to industry best practice and has embedded opito training and competence standards where
possible throughout the training plan and competence assurance system proof of the extent of this approach
was recognized by winning in november 2013 opitos employer of the year award in abu dhabi

the importance given to training and development applies not only to longstanding crew and technicians but also
to the additional workforce available locally that needs to familiarise itself with the specifics of the companys
activities to meet this need the company supports nationalisation programmes specifically in brazil angola
equatorial guinea and malaysia these programmes include enrolment of personnel into higher education
technical colleges and professional institutions either in their country of origin or even abroad eg scotland
special leadership and management courses and personal development courses the company has also
established process simulators replicating the central control rooms of the fpsos located in brazil and angola
in order to support our training and development activities these play a key role in our nationalisation
programmes

the wellbeing of all employees is paramount for attaining their best possible performance and output as a
company sbm offshore offers a noncash benefits package which is among the best in the industry

incentive programmes have been designed to cascade company objectives down to individual levels and reward
every employee for individual achievements as well as for their collective contribution the company has also
developed numerous nonfinancial recognition programmes to celebrate key project milestones and reward
significant individual achievements

a new bonus plan has been implemented in 2013 for all onshore employees worldwide to achieve this objective
to optimise employee engagement and to achieve performance levels incentive plans including kpis and
targets are now communicated to all employees with full transparency

the same philosophy for performance incentive plans will be initiated within the offshore population throughout
2014

retention

retaining key talent is essential to delivering the corporate strategy and achieving defined goals this is of
paramount importance given the increasing shortage of skills faced by the industry as a whole primarily the
company aims to retain talent through career development opportunities and by offering its employees the
possibility to work on the best fpso projects in the industry the companys compensation  benefits policy
supports this goal through the implementation of several longterm incentive schemes to reward longterm
commitment to the company although those plans may be difficult to implement consistently in all locations the
company is making every effort to bring those plans to fruition

the core principle of longterm initiatives are outlined below




sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                 87

   the employee share ownership plan esop encourages every employee depending on local regulations to invest in
     company shares offering a significant contribution from the company to the plan




365 employee wellbeing
the company conscious of the need to protect its most important asset is focused on the wellbeing of its
personnel and the need to provide a pleasant work environment in this respect several initiatives have been
implemented over the past few years across its execution centres such as


   implementation of international soscontrol risks medical evacuation repatriation and travel security coverage
     worldwide
   stress management and healthy living presentations to managers monaco houston and schiedam
   employee care officer consultations available to employees schiedam and monaco
   stop smoking campaigns in monaco
   fitness rooms in houston and monaco
   organisation of social events at all locations to encourage interaction
   bicycle plan in schiedam
   sbm nursery the monacobased professionallyrun nursery and preschool structure welcomes 34 children from 3
     months to school age


the companys focus on employee wellbeing complements the emphasis on ensuring a safe working
environment which the company considers as a priority

in november 2013 the company launched their initial global employee engagement survey with the aim of
gauging workplace perceptions and awareness of the companys objectives and programmes the survey
approached issues including strategy transformation and compensationto name a few the survey provider
began analysing responses in middecember 2013 results will have direct impact on 2014 action plans and will
be shared broadly with employees following a presentation to management



366 equal opportunities
the companys employment policy follows the principles of equal opportunity thereby preventing any
discrimination on the basis of sex age race religion political or trade union affiliations nationality or disability
salary scales are in line with a competency matrix and take into account qualifications and professional
experience the company considers this as an attractive element of the recruitment strategy

the offshore engineering business has long been maledominated however the company has adopted a
recruitment strategy to increase the percentage of female employees including in managerial positions in the
onshore segment over the past 15 years this initiative has been successful but only to a degree as the number
of graduates coming out of engineering schools and universities is still predominantly male which limits the
gender ratio in engineering positions moreover the operating crew onboard production units remain
overwhelmingly male as is the case for all operators in the offshore industry the total percentage of femalemale
permanent employees from both onshore operations and offshore production was 2476 in 2013 a similar
ratio to the previous year however it is to be noted that in the onshorebased population the total percentage of
permanent female employees reached 30 and in terms of management positions the female population

367 social responsibility
the company works hard to integrate social balance and equal opportunities whilst preserving cultural diversity
the company is committed to being globally aware promoting local development and operating with integrity
the company also believes that social responsibility means investing in the wellbeing of its staff and maximising
employee opportunities for success by providing stimulating challenges customised training and high levels of
work satisfaction all within a safe working environment



368 global workforce information
headcount

the total headcount is based on all the companys personnel permanent staff and contractors registered as at
31 december 2013 for onshore projects and offshore operations

the companys headcount totalled 9936 compared with 7493 in 2012 which represents an increase of 33
this includes the yard joint ventures brasabsl in brazil rj 2666 employees and paenal angola 1044
employees read more about headcount

the 2013 main increase in the global headcount is explained by the increase in activities in brasabsl with
associated growth in personnel 2191 permanent and contractors

at yearend 2013 the headcount of a permanent employees totalled 8358 representing 84 of the companys
workforce the headcount of contractor staff totalled 1578 employees representing 16 of the workforce

workforce diversity

over the decades with its business spreading over six continents the company has embraced the challenges
offered by different environments and adapted to this cultural mosaic the need for incountry adaptation and
development has created greater flexibility and diversity at all levels of the workforce indeed the company has
managed to turn diversity into a strength building stronger links and and synergies amongst its personnel

the companys policy to recruit localbased employees whilst at the same time maintaining competency
requirements through training has led to the employment of just over 90 different nationalities

in 2013 the company employed seven main nationalities brazilian 42 french 13 angolan 12 malaysian
7 dutch 5 american 4 and british 4

this is explained by the geographical position of the execution centers construction sites and offshore operations
units and shore bases

absenteeism and turnover

the average rate of absenteeism related to standard illness has decreased in 2013 to 269 

the net turnover rate excluding retirement and non work related deaths for 2013 was 131 and comprise firstly

372 neptune building
the companys monaco execution centre is looking forward to relocating into its newly refurbished neptune
building during 2014 office accommodation which has been retrofited to internationally recognised
environmental standards

in line with the companys sustainability values the building was refurbished to deliver environmental
performance in accordance with breeam 1 international environmental standards the company has
implemented many improvements and has ensured that the construction work adheres to standards of best
practice in sustainable design to achieve breeams prestigious very good rating

the objective of the refurbishment was to dramatically transform the space and upgrade the energy performance
of the building as part of this endeavour the project team conducted employee stakeholder assessment to
establish which features the companys employees wanted to see in their new offices the project team
integrated this feedback into the building design where possible

prior to the refurbishment the buildings energy costs were high for an office building of its size thanks to this
investment it is expected that the new building will consume only 80 kwhm2year this significant improvement in
energy saving is almost equivalent to the energy costs of constructing a new environmentally sustainable building
which today typically consumes 50 kwhm2year

to achieve this cost reduction the company will take advantage of monacos sunny climate through the use of
650 sq meters of solar panels the solar panels will produce 10 to 15 of the electricity required in addition to
the solar panels a solar hot water heating system will supply 70 of the buildings hot water needs

the overall energy consumption for the building has been greatly reduced due to several innovative features such
as lifts equipped with an energy recovery system and low consumption lighting with motion and luminosity
sensors in addition a special solar treated tripleskin fa√ßade with special curtains will help regulate the buildings
temperature thus reducing heating and cooling costs

41 2013 overview
411 2013 company overview
introduction
the company began its transformation in 2012 refocusing its strategy around fpsos and related products and
services followed by far reaching changes to the organisational structure emphasising accountability
transparency and compliance the results strong revenue growth good core performance and record backlog
clearly began to emerge in 2013 the transformation continues as the company focuses on strengthening project
controls support functions and operational disciplines across the business this is being achieved through a
programme to improve ways of working for people and through processes and systems designed to increase
effectiveness deliver control and allow the company to work as one

apart from the ongoing internal investigation into potentially improper sales practices the company has largely
consigned its legacy issues to the past the yme settlement was signed in march and the deep panuke platform
achieved production acceptance in december 2013 asset values have been adjusted where required through
the corporate and project financing activities completed in the year the financial position of the company is
markedly strengthened enabling it to competitively address the increasing demand for larger and more complex
projects from our clients

the project award delays encountered in 2012 combined with a strong commercial effort resulted in record order
                               1                                               1
levels in 2013 with directional order intake of us100 billion and directional backlog of us230 billion

consistent with the companys strategy to focus on its core business and to further strengthen the financial
position a number of noncore asset divestments were made during the period which include the sale and lease
back transactions of two out of three office properties in monaco and the sale of its noncore cool hose
technology

in the first half of the year the company strengthened its financial position through a 1 for 10 rights offering of
new ordinary shares raising us247 million and as a result of the settlement with talisman an additional us27
million topup from hal investments bv hal as a share premium contribution on the new ordinary shares it
acquired through a private placement in december 2012

the company secured a project loan facility for fpso ngoma for us600 million and bilateral credit facilities
for fpso cidade de maric√°and cidade de saquarema for us600 million the additional liquidity and greater
financial flexibility have further improved the companys risk profile for securing funding for future projects

ifrsbased disclosures the company introduced directional reporting directional reporting addresses the
complexity in the groups business model whereby turnkey sales are combined with construction projects for its
own lease  operate portfolio furthermore the companys fpso lease  operate contracts are increasingly
classified as finance leases which adds further complexity by accelerating revenue and profit recognition into the
                                                                                               1
construction phase well before rents are invoiced to and paid by the client the directional view extends
reporting with nonifrs disclosures showing revenues and results more in line with operating cash flows to
simplify some of these complexities this is designed to increase transparency and understanding of performance
                                                                                  1
and provide disclosures of backlog and income statement based on directional principles

                 1
   directional reportingis an additional disclosure to ifrs reporting
                 1
   directional reporting assumes all lease contracts are classified as operating lease
                 1
   directional reporting is limited to restating revenue and operating income no balance sheet restatements are made
                 1
   directional reportingis included in the financial review
                                       1
in order to introduce directional reporting the company achieved the following steps

                              1
   disclosure of directional income statement and backlog for h1 2013 and the h1 2012 comparison was made in august

   2014 guidance for directional revenue
                                              1
the need for the introduction of directional reporting is acute and significant revenue reported under ifrs rules
                        1
exceeds the directional view by some us14 billion in 2013 this represents the present value of future income
to be invoiced and realised over the next 20 years under ifrs the company reports a us111 million positive
                                                                        1

profitability
the primary business segments of the company are lease  operate and turnkey plus other nonallocated
corporate income and expense items ebitda and ebit are analysed per segment but it should be recognised
that business activities are closely related and certain costs are not specifically related to either one segment or
another for example when sales costs are incurred including significant sums for preparing the bid it is often
uncertain whether the project will be leased or contracted on a turnkey lump sum basis

in recent years new lease contracts are showing longer duration and are increasingly classified as finance leases
for accounting purposes whereby the fair value of the leased asset is recorded as a turnkey sale during
construction this has the effect of recognising in the turnkey segment during construction part of the lease
profits which would in the case of an operating lease be reported through the lease  operate segment during
the lease

nonallocated other income and expenses showed a net cost of us21 million in 2013 compared with us49
million in 2012 and includes us27 million of book profit relating to divesting activities in 2013

net financing costs increased to us100 million compared to 2012 us78 million mainly as a result of interest
paid on the us private placement set up for fpsos cidade de anchieta and fpso cidade de paraty project
loan the average cost of debt came to 53 in 2013 53 in 2012

more generally once production units are brought into service the financing costs are expensed to the income
statement whereas during construction interest is capitalised it should be emphasised that the net profit
contribution of newly operating leased units is limited by the relatively high interest burden during the first years of
operation although dedication of lease revenues to debt servicing leads to fast redemption of the loan balances
and hence reduced interest charges going forward

interest income on the companys cash balances was again very low in 2013 due to the low level of shortterm
us interest rates main interest income of the company is derived from interest bearing loans to joint ventures
and associates

the reported share of profit in associates was minimal in 2013 us1 million as it was in 2012 us4 million in

a accounting framework
the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with international

beginning 1 january 2013

effective standards that apply to the company

the company has adopted the following new standards with a date of initial application of 1 january 2013

postemployment defined benefit plans under the revised standard the company recognises actuarial gains and

management


   amendments to ias 1 presentation of items of other comprehensive income

the amendments to ias 1 change the grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income items that
could be reclassified or recycled to the income statement at a future point in time for example exchange
differences on translation of foreign operations and net movement on cash flow hedges will be presented
separately from items that will never be reclassified for example actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit
plans the amendment affects presentation only and hence had no impact on the companys financial position or
performance


   disclosure amendments to ifrs 7 offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities and ias 36 recoverable
     amount disclosures for nonfinancial assets


as a result of the amendments to ifrs 7 and ias 36 there is no impact to the companys disclosures

standards effective after 31 december 2013 that apply to the company

contrary to the companys original intention the companys financial statements as of 31 december 2013 do not
include the impact of standards published as of 31 december 2013 but which application is mandatory as per
european union as from financial years subsequent to the current year

ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements ifrs 11 joint arrangements and ifrs 12  disclosure of
interests in other entities

ifrs 10 introduces a new control model to determine whether an investee should be consolidated this new
model focuses on whether a group has power over an investee exposure or rights to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee and its ability to use its power to affect those returns

ifrs 11 changes the accounting treatment for interests in joint arrangements by distinguishing two types of joint
arrangements


   a companys interest in a joint operation which is an arrangement in which a company has rights to the assets and
     obligations for the liabilities will be accounted for on the basis of the companys interest in those assets and liabilities and


   a companys interest in a joint venture which is an arrangement in which a company has rights only to the net assets will
     be equityaccounted


when making this assessment ifrs 11 requires consideration of the structure of joint arrangements the legal
form of any separate vehicles the contractual terms of the arrangements and other facts and circumstances
previously the structure of the arrangement was the sole focus of classification

in accordance with these new standards the company has reviewed the treatment of its jointly controlled entities
as a consequence the company expects the following changes in accounting treatment of its interests in joint
arrangements as from 1 january 2014

the change had no impact on equity and profit but led to a different presentation of the companys financial
position comprehensive income and cash flow statement the 2012 comparative figures have been restated
accordingly for comparison purposes




sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                       130

b consolidation principles
all the companies which are controlled exclusively by the company are consolidated using the global integration
method this includes special purpose entities for which the company has the power to govern the financial and
operating policies

proportionate consolidation is used for joint ventures for which the activities are executed by jointly controlled
entities the list of the companys proportionally consolidated joint controlled entities is provided in note 34
interest in joint ventures and associates

the equity method is used for investments over which the company has significant influence but not control over
operational and financial policies

the main affiliates of the company close their accounts as of 31 december and all consolidated companies apply
company accounting standards

all intercompany balances and transactions as well as internal income and expenses are fully eliminated

subsidiaries are consolidated as of the date of acquisition being the date on which the company obtains control
and continue to be consolidated until the date control ceases



c critical accounting policies
the distinction between current assets and liabilities and noncurrent assets and liabilities is based on their
maturity assets and liabilities are classified as current if their maturity is less than twelve months or
noncurrent if their maturity exceeds twelve months

the preparation of financial statements in compliance with ifrs requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates
are material are disclosed in the paragraphs below

a use of estimates

in the preparation of the financial statements it is necessary for management of the company to make estimates
and certain assumptions that can affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities and the outcome of the income
statement the actual outcome may differ from these estimates and assumptions estimates and judgments are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future
events that are believed to be reasonable

in particular significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that
have the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements are


   the anticipated useful life and residual value of the leased facilities
   the lease classification
   the revenue and margin recognition on construction contracts based on the stage of completion method
   the impairment of property plant and equipment and intangible assets
   the impact of variation orders incentives and claims from clients where negotiations or discussions are at a sufficiently


sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                             131

     advanced stage
   the future costs to complete for construction projects and required contingencies
   the timing and estimated cost of demobilisation
   the companys taxation and
   the companys exposure to litigation with third parties and noncompliance

b leases accounting by lessor

a lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a payment or series of payments
the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time

leases in which a significant portion of the risk and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified
as operating leases the asset is included in the statement of financial position as property plant and equipment
lease income is recognised over the term of the lease on a straightline basis this implies the recognition of
deferred income when the contractual day rates are not constant during the initial term of the lease contract

when assets are leased under a finance lease the present value of the lease payments is recognised as a
financial asset the difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised
as revenue lease income is as of the commencement date of the lease contract recognised over the term of
the lease using the net investment method which reflects a constant periodic rate of return during the
construction period of the facility the contract is treated as a construction contract whereby the stage of
completion method is applied

c impairment of nonfinancial assets

assets that have an indefinite useful life for example goodwill are not subject to amortisation and are tested
annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are tested for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable an impairment
loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount the
recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and valueinuse for the purpose of
assessing impairment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash
flows cashgenerating units nonfinancial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed for
possible reversal of the impairment at each statement of financial position date recoverable amounts are
determined based on valueinuse calculations that require the use of estimates

d impairment of financial assets

the company assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets
together referred to as financial asset is impaired at the end of each reporting date a financial asset is
impaired and impairment losses are recognised only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one
or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset a loss event and that loss event or events
has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset that can be reliably estimated the criteria
that the company uses to determine whether there is objective evidence of an impairment loss include


   significant financial difficulty of the obligor
   a breach of contract such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments
   the company for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulty grant to the borrower a
     concession that the lender would not otherwise consider



sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                      132

   it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation
   national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the financial assets

the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value
of the estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the
financial assets original effective interest rate the assets carrying amount is reduced and the amount of the loss
is recognised in the income statement if the financial asset has a variable interest rate the discount rate for
measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract

if in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the reversal of the previously recognised
impairment loss is recognised in the income statement

impairment on trade and other receivables is described later in section d significant accounting policies

e revenue

revenue is shown net of valueadded tax returns rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the
group


   construction contracts

construction contracts are accounted for using the percentageofcompletion method revenue and gross margin
are recognised each period based upon the advancement of the workinprogress

the percentageofcompletion is calculated based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs
provisions for anticipated losses are made in full in the period in which they become known

complex projects that present a high risk profile due to technical novelty complexity or pricing arrangements
agreed with the client are subject to gate reviews at advanced degrees of completion in engineering prior to
recognition of margin typically around 25 complete until this point no margin is recognised with revenue
recognised to the extent of cost incurred

due to the nature of the services performed variation orders and claims are commonly billed to clients in the
normal course of business additional contract revenue arising from variation orders is recognised when it is more
than probable that the client will approve the variation and the amount of revenue arising from the variation can be
reliably measured revenue resulting from claims is recognised in contract revenue only when negotiations have
reached an advanced stage such that it is more than probable that the client will accept the claim and that the
amount can be measured reliably


   lease and operate contracts

revenue from longterm operating lease contracts is reported on a straightline basis over the period of the
contract once the system has been brought into service the difference between straightline revenue and the
contractual dayrates which may not be constant throughout the charter is included as deferred income
revenue from finance lease contracts is as of the commencement date of the lease contract recognised over
the term of the lease using the net investment method which reflects a constant periodic rate of return




sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                              133

f construction work in progress

construction work in progress is stated at cost plus profit recognised to date less any provisions for foreseeable
losses and less invoiced instalments cost includes all expenditures related directly to specific projects and
attributable overhead where instalments exceed the value of the related costs the excess is included in current
liabilities advances received from customers are also included in current liabilities

g cash flow statement

to improve visibility to stakeholders the company applies the following presentation whereas the structure of
cash outflows and inflows for finance leases is similar to operating leases because no cash is received from the
client during the construction period except any advance payments and the investment is repaid during the
lease period through the bareboat charter the company has therefore aligned its finance lease presentation with
operating leases as follows


   during the construction period cash outflows are treated as investing activities and not as operating activities
   during the lease period cash inflows are treated as operating activities and not as investing activities

given the nature of the commitments inflows and outflows from interestbearing loans to joint ventures and
associates are treated as investing activities




d significant accounting policies
a financial assets

the company classifies its financial assets into finance lease receivables and other financial assets

finance leases are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determined payments that are not quoted in an
active market they are included in current assets except for maturities greater than twelve months after the end
of the reporting period which are classified as noncurrent assets

other financial assets relates primarily to interestbearing loans to joint ventures that have a remaining term of
more than one year

b borrowings bank and other loans

borrowings are recognised initially at fair value measured at amortised cost and classified as current liabilities
unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after
the statement of financial position date

c segment information

as per ifrs 8 an operating segment is a component of an entity


   that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses
   whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entitys chief operating decision maker and
   for which distinct financial information is available


sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                    134

effective as from 1 january 2013 the turnkey services segment has been merged with the turnkey systems
segment to form a new turnkey segment

the three business segments as reported to the chief operating decision maker the management board are
therefore organised as follows


   the lease and operate segment includes all earned dayrates on longterm operating lease and operate contracts in the
     case of a finance lease revenue is recognised during the construction and installation period within the turnkey segment
     as of the commencement date of a finance lease contract interest income is shown in this segment
   the turnkey segment includes monaco houston schiedam and kuala lumpur execution centres that derive revenues
     from turnkey supply contracts and aftersales services which consist mainly of large production systems large mooring
     systems deep water export systems fluid transfer systems tanker loading and discharge terminals design services and
     supply of special components and proprietary designs and equipment
   other which consists of corporate overhead functions and other units

d foreign currency transactions and financial instruments

foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency the us dollar at the exchange rate
applicable on the transaction date at the closing date monetary assets and liabilities stated in foreign currencies
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on that date resulting exchange gains
or losses are directly recorded in the income statement except exchange gains or losses on cash accounts
eligible for future cash flow hedging on net foreign currency investments

translation of foreign currency income statements of subsidiaries into us dollars are converted at the average
exchange rate prevailing during the year statements of financial position are translated at the exchange rate at
the closing date differences arising in the translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded
in other comprehensive income as foreign currency translation reserve on consolidation exchange differences
arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings of such investments are
taken to company equity

derivative financial instruments held by the company are aimed at hedging risks associated with foreign
currency and interest rate fluctuations a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting cash flow hedge or
net investment hedge when there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and of the
effectiveness of the hedge throughout the life of the contract a cash flow hedge aims to reduce risks incurred by
variations in the value of future cash flows that may impact net income a net investment hedge aims to reduce
risks incurred by variations in the value of the net investment in a foreign operation

in order for a derivative to be eligible for hedge accounting treatment the following conditions must be met


   its hedging role must be clearly defined and documented at the date of inception and
   its efficiency should be proven at the date of inception and as long as it remains highly effective in offsetting exposure to
     changes in the fair value of the hedged item or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk


all derivative instruments are recorded and disclosed in the statement of financial position at fair value where a
portion of a financial derivative is expected to be realised within twelve months of the reporting date that portion
should be presented as current the remainder of the financial derivative should be shown as noncurrent

changes in fair value of derivatives designated in cash flow or net investment hedge relationships are recognised
as follows



sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                           135

   the effective portion of the gain or loss of the hedging instrument is recorded directly in other comprehensive income and
     the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the income statement the exchange
     gain or loss which is deferred in equity is reclassified to the net income in the periods in which the specified hedged
     transaction affects the income statement and
   the changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify as hedging in accounting standards are
     directly recorded in the income statement


when measuring the fair value of a financial instrument the company uses market observable data as far as
possible fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the
valuation techniques further information about the fair value measurement of financial derivatives is included in
the note 30 financial instruments  fair values and risk management

e offsetting financial instruments

financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net
basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously

f provisions

provisions are recognised if and only if the following criteria are simultaneously met


   the company has an ongoing obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event
   the settlement of the obligation will likely require an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits and
   the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated provisions are measured according to the risk assessment or the
     exposed charge based upon bestknown elements


demobilisation obligations relate to estimated costs for demobilisation of leased facilities at the end of the
respective lease period for operating leases the net present value of the future obligations is included in
property plant and equipment with a corresponding amount included in the provision for demobilisation as the
remaining duration of each lease reduces and the discounting effect on the provision unwinds accrued interest is
recognised as part of financial expenses and added to the provision for finance lease contracts demobilisation
obligations are analysed as a component of the sale recognized under ias 17  leases  and accrued for as
deferred income until demobilisation occurs

warranties where the company makes good by repair or replacement defective items that become apparent
within an agreed period starting from final acceptance of the delivered system are provided to customers on most
turnkey sales this provision is classified as current by nature as it coincides with the production cycle of the
company

g property plant and equipment

property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses

historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of such items the capital value
of a facility to be leased and operated for a client is the sum of external costs such as shipyards subcontractors
suppliers internal costs design engineering construction supervision etc third party financial costs including
interest paid during construction and attributable overheads


sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                              136

subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the company and the
cost of the item can be measured reliably the costs of assets include the initial estimate of costs of
demobilisation of the asset all other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the
financial period in which they are incurred

when significant parts of an item of property plant and equipment have different useful lives those components
are accounted for as separate line items of property plant and equipment with the exception of the
thunderhawk facility depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis as follows


   converted tankers 1020 years including in vessels and floating equipment
   floating equipment 315 years including in vessels and floating equipment
   buildings 3050 years
   other assets 220 years
   land is not depreciated

the depreciation charge for the thunderhawk facility is calculated based on its future anticipated economic
benefits this results in a depreciation charge partly based on the units of production method and for the other
part based on the straightline method

residual values useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at least annually and adjusted if
appropriate

the assets residual values are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each statement of financial position date
an assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is
higher than its estimated recoverable amount

gains and losses arising on disposals or retirement of assets are determined by comparing any sales proceeds
and the carrying amount of the asset these are reflected in the income statement in the period that the asset is
disposed of or retired

h intangible assets

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the companys share of the net
identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of the acquisition

goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units cgus for the purpose of the annual impairment testing

patents are amortised over their useful life on a straightline basis over fifteen years

research costs are expensed when incurred in compliance with ias 38 development costs are capitalised and
amortised over its useful life if all of the following criteria are met


   the projects are clearly defined
   the company is able to reliably measure expenditures incurred by each project during its development
   the company is able to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the project
   the company has the financial and technical resources available to achieve the project
   the company can demonstrate its intention to complete to use or to commercialise products resulting from the project
     and



sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                         137

   the company is able to demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or if it is used
     internally the usefulness of the intangible asset


the development costs capitalised in 2013 are contained in note 11 intangible assets

the carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever internal or external events indicate
that there may be impairment in which case an impairment loss is recognised

i assets or disposal groups held for sale

the company classifies assets or disposal groups as being held for sale when the following criteria are met


   management has committed to a plan to sell the asset or disposal group
   the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition
   an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset or disposal group
     have been initiated
   the sale of the asset or disposal group is highly probable
   transfer of the asset or disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year
   the asset or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair
     value and
   actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the
     plan will be withdrawn


assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value or fair value
less costs of disposal noncurrent assets are not depreciated once they meet the criteria to be held for sale and
are shown separately on the face of the consolidated statement of financial position

j inventories

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value cost is determined using the firstin firstout
method net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated
cost of completion and selling expenses inventories comprise semifinished and finished products valued at cost
including attributable overheads and spare parts stated at the lower of purchase price or market value

k trade and other receivables

at each balance sheet date the company assesses whether any indications exist that a financial asset or group
of financial assets is impaired

in relation to trade receivables a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the
company may not be able to collect all of the amounts due impaired trade receivables are derecognised when
they are determined to be uncollectible

other receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method interest income together
with gains and losses when the receivables are derecognised or impaired is recognised in the income statement

l cash and cash equivalents

cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in bank and in hand fulfilling the following criteria a maturity of usually


sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                                138

less than three months highly liquid a fixed exchange value and an extremely low risk of loss of value

m share capital

ordinary shares and protective preference shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable
to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds

n income tax

the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax tax is recognised in the income statement
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in this
case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity

the company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining
the worldwide provision for income taxes there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business the company recognises liabilities for
anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due where the final tax
outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will influence
the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made

income tax expenses comprise corporate income tax due in countries of incorporation of the companys main
subsidiaries and levied on actual profits income tax expense also includes the corporate income taxes which are
levied on a deemed profit basis and revenue basis withholding taxes this presentation adequately reflects sbm
offshores global tax burden

o deferred income tax

deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the statement of financial position
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is
settled

deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
against which the temporary differences can be utilised deferred tax is provided for on temporary differences
arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary
difference is controlled by the company and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future

p employee benefits

pension obligations the company operates various pension schemes that are generally funded through
payments determined by periodic actuarial calculations to insurance companies or are defined as multiemployer
plans the company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans


   a defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on
     retirement usually dependent on one or more factors such as age years of service and compensation
   a defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the company pays fixed contributions to public or private
     pension insurance plans on a mandatory contractual or voluntary basis the company has no legal or constructive



sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                                      139

     obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating
     to employee service in the current and prior periods the contributions to defined contribution plans and multiemployer
     plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred


the liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date less the fair value of the
plan assets together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and past service costs the
defined benefit obligation is calculated periodically by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit
method the present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future
cash outflows using interest rates on highquality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the
terms of the companys obligations

cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions
are recognised immediately in comprehensive income

pastservice costs are recognised immediately as an expense in the income statement

share based payments within the company there are three types of share based payment plans that qualify as
equity settled


   rsupsu
   performance shares
   matching bonus shares

the estimated total amount to be expensed over the vesting period related to share based payments is
determined by reference to the fair value of the instruments determined at the grant date excluding the impact of
any nonmarket vesting conditions nonmarket vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number
of shares that the employee will ultimately receive main assumptions for estimates are revised at statement of
financial position date total cost for the period is charged or credited to the income statement with a
corresponding adjustment to equity

when equity instruments are exercised the company issues new shares

accordingly thus the companys reportable segments are identified as follows


    lease and operate
    turnkey
    other this category consists of corporate overhead functions and other units

sales between segments are carried out at arms length the revenue to third parties and noncurrent assets
reported to the chief operating decision maker the management board are measured in a manner consistent
with that in the income statement and statement of financial position these assets are allocated based on the

the year was marked by the following financial highlights

divestment programme for noncore assets

as part of the disposal program of noncore assets announced in 2012 the company completed sale of its
noncore cool hose technology and the sale and lease back transactions of two out of three office
properties in monaco sales proceeds thus far exceed us 100 million resulting in a book profit of approximately
us 27 million reported as other operating income in 2013

yme project

in march 2013 the company reached an agreement with talisman to terminate the yme mopustor contract
for a settlement of us 470 million the settlement includes the termination of the existing agreements and
arbitration procedures and the decommissioning of the mopu as the company had already made a provision of
us 200 million for estimated decommissioning costs in 2012 the difference of us 270 million was recognised
in the 2013 results as cost of sales

the company is currently investigating the possibility to recover losses incurred in connection with the yme
development project from insurers under the terms of the settlement agreement with talisman all pending and

future claim recoveries after expenses and legal costs relating to the yme development project under the
relevant construction all risks insurance shall be shared 5050 between the company and talisman

during 2013 the company has started with the preparation for the future demobilisation works of the platform
and as such it has incurred related costs a call for tender for the transportation from the 500 meters zone and
the scrapping of the platform was issued and responses were being evaluated at yearend 2013 on this basis
the company has reviewed and updated the necessary accruals for these future works which are currently
anticipated to occur during summer 2015

deep panuke project

the company completed the debottlenecking process and brought the platform to full production capacity safely
and received a production acceptance notice pan from the client on 11 december 2013 the platform is
currently on hire and generating the full day rate as per contract terms additional costs associated with the delay
and debottlenecking lead to an additional impairment charge of us 27 million accounted for in the 2013 results

thunderhawk

the thunderhawk semisubmersible production facility in the us gulf of mexico is the only facility in the
company lease fleet portfolio which bears exposure to reservoir risk

during the second half of 2013 there have been two new triggering events for impairment

 production has declined more quickly than originally projected due to a lack of reservoir drive compounded by a
higher than anticipated water cut

 the company has engaged in commercial discussions around potential tiebacks to the facility

the revised estimates of future deliverable volumes derived from production trends from current reserves and
projections from planned new fields including a potential tieback in 2015 and the expected rates derived from
recent commercial discussions will be insufficient to sustain the assets current book value

as a result an impairment charge of us 65 million has been accounted for in the 2013 results

decommissioning review

with the upcoming expiration of contracts for fpso kuito and fpso brasil the company has undertaken the
reassessment of decommissioning costs as a consequence a companywide review was conducted in the last
quarter of 2013 to reassess decommissioning expenses of all other vessels this review was conducted while
taking into consideration various contractual obligations resulting from the contracts with customers and revised
decommissioning costs estimates derived from the quotes received for imminent decommissioning of certain
vessels resulting in a charge of us 40 million accounted for in the 2013 results

residual value of laidup vessels

the fpso falcon and vlcc alba laid up since 2009 and 2011 respectively have been classified as assets held
for sale and were subsequently written down to their estimated market value resulting in an impairment of us
53 million

note 7 income tax
the relationship between the companys income tax expense and profit before income tax referred to as
effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period considering among other factors a changes in
the blend of income that is taxed based on gross revenues versus profit before taxes and b the location of the
companys operations generally annual marginal tax rate is lower than annual effective tax rate consequently
income tax expense does not change proportionally with income before income taxes significant decreases in
profit before income tax typically lead to a higher effective tax rate while significant increases in profit before
income taxes can lead to a lower effective tax rate subject to the other factors impacting income tax expense

contingent liabilities
the company reported with a press release on 10 april 2012 that it had become aware of certain sales practices
involving third parties which may have been improper an investigation was commenced in 2012 at the request of
the company into alleged payments involving sales intermediaries in certain african countries in the period 2007
through 2011 in order to determine whether these alleged payments violated anticorruption laws in the course
of the investigation allegations were made of improper payments in countries outside africa but to date no
conclusive proof of such allegations has been established the investigation is being carried out by outside legal
counsel and forensic accountants with the support of the chief governance and compliance officer and under
the oversight of the audit committee

as the investigation is not yet concluded the company cannot make any definitive statements regarding the
findings of the investigation the initial feedback received to date is that there are indications that substantial
payments were made mostly through intermediaries which appear to have been intended for government
officials

the companys new management board appointed in the course of 2012 has introduced new policies
processes and systems established an independent compliance function enhanced its internal controls and
monitoring systems and continues to emphasise awareness of proper compliance throughout the company up to
the highest management levels

the company voluntarily disclosed the investigation to the dutch public prosecution service openbaar
ministerie om and the united states department of justice doj in 2012 and has remained in active dialogue
with these authorities the company disclosed the initial feedback from the investigation to the authorities
actively cooperates with them and continues to give followup on specific questions
at this stage it is not possible to state anything on the outcome of the investigation financial or otherwise
but failure to comply with anticorruption laws once established could give rise to criminal prosecution
by the om the doj or any local authorities civil claims or administrative proceedings against the company this
could result in the company paying damages or significant fines or penalties imposed by the om the doj or any
local authorities as well as disgorgements debarment or other remedies which could have a material financial
impact on the company however a reasonable estimate cannot be made at this stage

additional information

 in the above table the company has disclosed the fair value of each class of financial assets and financial
liabilities in a way that permits the information to be compared with the carrying amounts

 classes of financial instruments that are not used are not disclosed

 the company has not disclosed the fair values for financial instruments such as finance leases receivables
shortterm trade receivables and payables because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair
values as the impact of discounting is not significant

responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section our responsibility for the audit of the
financial statements of our report we are independent of sbm offshore nv within the meaning of the relevant
dutch ethical requirements as included in the verordening op de gedrags en beroepsregels accountants
vgba and the verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants vio and have fulfilled our other
responsibilities under those ethical requirements we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is

the key audit matters from our audit

key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgement were of most significance in our audit of
the financial statements key audit matters are selected from the matters communicated with the management
board and the supervisory board but are not intended to represent all matters that were discussed with them



sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                              201

our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial
statements as a whole our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the key audit
matters described below and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters

revenue recognition on construction contracts involves significant judgement

the engineering and construction of floating production storage and offloading systems fpsos is complex
and exposes the company to various business and financial reporting risks revenue arising from construction
contracts in its turnkey segment represents more than 75 of the groups total revenue the recognition of
revenue and the estimation of the outcome of construction contracts requires significant management judgement
in particular with respect to estimating the cost to complete and the amounts of variation orders to be recognised
in addition significant management judgement is required to assess the consequences of various legal
proceedings in respect of construction contracts reference is made to 426 notes to the consolidated financial
statements accounting principles c critical accounting policies e revenue construction contracts

we identified revenue from construction contracts as a significant risk requiring special audit consideration our
audit procedures included an evaluation of the significant judgements made by management among others
based on an examination of the associated project documentation and discussion on the status of projects under
construction with finance and technical staff of the company we also tested the controls that the company has
put in place over its process to record contract costs and contract revenues and the calculation of the stage of
completion in addition we visited two projects under construction furthermore we discussed the status of legal
proceedings in respect of construction contracts examined various documents in this respect and obtained
lawyers letters

lease classification is complex and requires significant judgement

the companys primary business is to enter into lease agreements for fpsos with its clients this concerns both
finance leases in which the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the client and operating leases in
which the company retains significant risks of ownership of the fpso the classification of a lease agreement
either as a finance lease or an operating lease is complex and requires significant management judgement
furthermore the classification determines the timing of revenue recognition and the presentation in the statement
of financial position reference is made to 426 notes to the consolidated financial statements accounting
principles c critical accounting policies b leases accounting by lessor

our audit procedures included an examination of new lease agreements and modifications thereof an evaluation
of the significant managements judgements with respect to the classification based on the criteria for finance
lease or operating lease as described in ias 17 leases furthermore we assessed the proper recognition of
revenues and the presentation in the statement of financial position in respect of the lease agreements

contingent liability following internal investigation into alleged improper sales practices

the company announced with a press release on 10 april 2012 that it had become aware of certain sales
practices involving third parties which may have been improper reference is made to 426 notes to the
consolidated financial statements note 29 commitments and contingencies the investigation identified that
there are indications that substantial payments were made mostly through intermediaries which appear to have
been intended for government officials this matter required special audit consideration due to its nature

we have assessed the progress and the findings from the investigation and examined various documents in this
respect our procedures included regular discussions with the management board and lawyers responsible for


sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                             202

the investigation an assessment of the remediation measures taken by the company verification of agents fees
paid during the year and obtaining lawyers letters with respect to their activities furthermore we assessed the
adequacy of the disclosure in this respect in note 29 which describes that the outcome of the investigation may
lead to significant penalties fines or other consequences which may have a material financial impact on the
company however a reliable estimate can not be made at this stage therefore in accordance with ias 37
provisions contingent liabilities and contingent assets a provision has not been recognised in the statement of
financial position as at 31 december 2013

going concern

the companys financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting the use of
this basis of accounting is appropriate unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease
operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so as part of our audit of the financial statements we concur
with managements use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the companys financial
statements

management has not identified a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the companys ability to
continue as a going concern and accordingly none is disclosed in the financial statements

based on our audit of the financial statements we also have not identified such a material uncertainty however
neither management nor the auditor can guarantee the companys ability to continue as a going concern

responsibilities of the management board and the supervisory board for the financial statements

the management board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with euifrs and with part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code and for the preparation of the report
of the management board in accordance with part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code furthermore the
management board is responsible for such internal control as the management board determines is necessary to
enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud
or error the supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the companys financial reporting process

our responsibility for the audit of the financial statements

the objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes
our opinion reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with the dutch standards on auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists
misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements

as part of an audit in accordance with dutch standards on auditing we exercise professional judgement and
maintain professional skepticism throughout the planning and performance of the audit we also

 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to fraud or error
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions
misrepresentations or the override of internal control


sbm offshore nv 2013 annual report                                                                             203

 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entitys internal control

 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by management

 evaluate the overall presentation structure and content of the financial statements including the disclosures
and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves
fair presentation

 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the company and business
activities within the company to express an opinion on the financial statements

we are required to communicate with the supervisory board regarding among other matters the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies in internal control that
we identified during our audit

we are also required to provide supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable related safeguards

report on the report of the management board and other information

pursuant to the legal requirement under part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code regarding our responsibility to
report on the report of the management board and the other information

 we have no deficiencies to report as a result of our examination whether the report of the management board
to the extent we can assess has been prepared in accordance with part 9 of book 2 of this code and whether
the other information as required by part 9 of book 2 has been annexed

 we report that the report of the management board to the extent we can assess is consistent with the financial
statements

employees locally employed agency staff contractors and subcontractors in the fabrication sites offices and
offshore workers ie all people working for the company

reporting of indicators for health safety and security hss are divided into four main sections onshore
projects offshore operations offshore contracting and construction yards onshore projects consists of sbm
offshore employees and contractors in all offices yards and sbm operations employees based in the monaco
office offshore operations includes all vessels operated and owned by sbm offshore and their respective
supporting shorebases offshore contracting specifically refers to the normand installer crew and onshore
support staff construction yards employees for hss reporting consist of employees from the brazil based yards
which sbm offshore owns andor operates in joint venture

hsse incident reporting is registered and managed through the companys single incident reporting system
sirs database sirs is a reporting system that is used to collect data on all incidents on all units operated by
the company sirs is a web based application which allows data entry from anywhere in the world

the sirs system will also record an incident that is classed as environmental ie any unwanted release of
pollutants to the environment

incidents are reported based on the incident classifications as defined by oil and gas producers ogp the
company also reports incident data from subcontractors construction facilities if the incident is related to a sbm
offshore project

the company uses manhours records and sirs data to calculate health and safety performance indicators set
by sbm offshore

in addition to the sirs monitoring application the monthly hsse report issued by the group hsse department
consolidates hsse records and events for the company covering onshore and offshore

   units in which the company exercises full operational management control
   units in which the company has full ownership or participates in a joint venture jv partnership where the company
     controls 50 or more of the shares


offshore operations environmental performance results are chosen according to the performance indicators
relative to gri and ogp guidelines1 this includes


   greenhouse gases referred to as ghg which are n o nitrous oxide ch methane and co carbon dioxide
                                                        2                     4                   2

   ghg emissions per hydrocarbon production from flaring
   ghg emissions per hydrocarbon production from energy generation
   gas flared per hydrocarbon production
   energy consumption per hydrocarbon production
   oil in produced water per hydrocarbon production

the environmental performance of the company is reported by region brazil angola and rest of the world
based on the criteria stated above sbm offshore reports on the environmental performance for following vessels
   brazil  fpso brasil fpso marlim sul fpso espirito santo fpso capixaba fpso cidade de anchieta and fpso
     cidade de party
   angola  fpso kuito fpso mondo and fpso saxi batuque
   rest of world  fpso aseng fso yetagun and pfc deep panuke

the segmental reporting for 2013 has changed from last year and the reporting of some 2012 performance
indicators have been revised to allow for yeartoyear comparison

the average for sbm offshore at the bottom of each table is a weighted average calculated pro rata the volume
of hydrocarbon production per region

the calculation of air emissions from offshore operations units is by the method recommended by oil  gas uk
oguk

the company uses the world resources institute greenhouse gas protocol ghg protocol method to calculate
co2 equivalents co2 equivalency is a quantity that describes for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse
gas the amount of co2 that would have the same global warming potential gwp when measured over a
specified timescale generally 100 years for further information on the ghg protocol and country specific
calculation methods please refer to their website httpwwwghgprotocolorgcalculationtools

environmental spills to air except gas leaks which are not quantifiable water or land from the offshore
operations units are reported using the data recorded in the single incident reporting system sirs database

environmental waste include restricted nonrestricted and naturally occurring radioactive materialnorm
waste generated waste is reported every month by offshore operations units on a specific form

environmental waste is reported for twelve vessels following the reporting boundaries described at the beginning

construction yards employees for human resources reporting purposes consist of employees for yards located
in brazil and angola

for some performance indicators the company makes a split between onshore and offshore activities onshore
includes all sbm offshore employees and contractors in onshore offices yards and sbm operations employees
based in monaco offshore includes all fleet and their respective supporting shore base this breakdown does not
include construction yard employees
