                                   dear shareholders
                                   the growing optimism observed during the course of the fiscal year 2010 was tempered in the
                                   year under review by the sovereign debt crisis in europe and the nuclear catastrophe in japan
                                   the weakness of the euro and us dollar our two most important reference currencies against
                                   the swiss franc had a material impact on our business the markets relevant to burckhardt
                                   compression showed divergent developments during the past year

                                   significantly higher order intake despite these strong headwinds order inflow from the markets
                                   of relevance to burckhardt compression was positive fullyear order intake amounted to
                                   chf 4049 mn which represents an increase of 117 over the previous year the strong appre
                                   ciation in the value of the swiss franc versus most other currencies had a negative impact on
                                   reported order intake and its gross profit margin

                                   improved profitability on slightly lower sales sales of chf 3289 mn were chf 267 mn or 75
                                   lower than in the previous year but gross profit increased by chf 67 mn to chf 1223 mn result
                                   ing in a gross profit margin of 372 operating profit rose by chf 33 mn or 54 from the prior
                                   year level which lifted the operating profit margin to 197 173 in the previous year net
                                   income was up by 120 and amounted to chf 505 mn chf 451 mn in the previous year or 154
                                   of sales a respectable achievement considering how challenging the market was last year

                                   difficult exchange rate situation thanks to the companys high rate of innovation productivity
                                   gains and increased sourcing from foreign countries natural hedging we have maintained our
                                   sharp competitive edge even though much of the added value we offer our customers is created
                                   in switzerland and despite the unrelenting headwinds on the forex front the minimum exchange
                                   rate to the euro imposed by the swiss national bank lowered exchange rate volatility and enhanced
                                   planning certainty

                                   strong balance sheet burckhardt compression strengthened its capital base during the year
                                   under review equity increased to chf 2828 mn or a solid 533 of the balance sheet total as of
                                   march 31 2012 holdings of cash and cash equivalents grew as well and amounted to chf 1850 mn

the management buyout in 2002 and contributed to its successful development in many ways

outlook for fiscal year 2012 business in the current year will be shaped in part by the impon
derables relating to europes debt problem the threat of a slowdown in the global economy and
exchange rate movements nevertheless from todays perspective we expect another increase
in order inflow at both business areas in the current fiscal year thanks to the current high order
backlog sales will be substantially higher than in the year under review we expect a somewhat
lower operating profit margin compared to the previous year this is because of the lower average
margin on orders for compressor systems that will be delivered during the current year as a              valentin vogt
result of the price concessions that were granted when these orders were placed  because of
the strength of the swiss franc at that time  margins will be lower

being placed again and major conversion and renovation proj

research and development
extended process gas compressor product line a
market success
as expected the extension of the successful line of process
gas compressors api 618 at the upper end of the performance
range was met with considerable interest in the marketplace
powered by up to 31 mw this most recent addition to burckhardt
compressions line of process gas compressors enables it to
meet all current and foreseeable specifications for largescale
plants the order of the first system during the past year marks
an important reference in expanding our position in refinery and
petrochemical applications

further milestones reached in the development
of a stepless flow control system for reciprocating
compressors
the project for developing and launching a stepless flow control
system for reciprocating compressors passed further mile
stones in the reporting year this system offers various process
control advantages and significant energy savings compared to
conventional control systems initial field tests confirmed the
clearly superior levels of the two key variables of controllability
and energy consumption the successful conclusion of further
field tests as well as longterm tests across a range of differ
ent applications will lay the basis for a broad market launch

financial expenses financial expenses mainly arose from the
local bank funding secured by the indian subsidiary and the
mortgage loan for the commercial real estate in winterthur
the slight increase in financial expenses in fiscal year 2011 is
attributable to the increase in the interest rates charged to the
indian subsidiary on its local borrowing

impairment tests for goodwill goodwill is allocated to the
identifiable cashgenerating units of the burckhardt compres
sion group crosshead piston compressors and standard high
pressure compressors the recoverable amount of a cashgen
erating unit is determined by calculating its value in use these
calculations are based on cash flows projections which in turn
are based on the midterm plans approved by management for
this purpose five planning years are taken into consideration
applying the parameters listed below as well as a terminal
value with no growth at all management estimated the planned
gross profit margin based on past developments and the expec
tations regarding future market developments historical data
were used to make cautious assumptions the assumptions
listed below were used in the analysis of each cashgenerating
unit no impairment losses were recognized for fiscal years 2011
and 2010
