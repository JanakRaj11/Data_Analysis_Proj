 in the meiji modernization age mt besshi had been transformed into a red barren           photo sumitomo historical archives
 mountain wasteland as its forests were cleared to procure firewood for roasting ore
 and charcoal for smelting and as sulfur dioxide gas laid waste to other plant and animal life
      sumitomo took various actions over the years to solve the pollution problem such as moving the smelter to an
 uninhabited island putting limits on copper production and installing sulfur dioxide capture and neutralization
 technologies it also planted as many as 1 million trees annually at the besshi copper mine site to restore the forest a

    the earth has limited mineral resources some of which will dry up some day in recognition of that
    fact smms mission is to create new resources using our strengths as a cuttingedge technology
    company for example useful metals can be efﬁciently extracted from lowgrade minerals that
    contain many impurities valuable metals are being extracted from worn out batteries and other
    waste materials by means of recycling which also helps to reduce waste as the ideal company
    we hope to have established these technologies by 2020 so that a cycle of pdca will lead us
    towards a new goal
       further technological development requires greater mutual cooperation and the synergy of
    advanced technologies possessed by each division the smeltingreﬁning development center
    is scheduled to start in fy2013 with the goal of increasing our technological strength even for
    employees who are not directly connected to the recycling department we want everyone to
    receive information via the inhouse bulletin and other methods so as to raise awareness of the
    usefulness of our work in society and what is expected of us in terms of effective use of resources

             in light of continued extreme weather patterns for the past several years the world economic
             forum based in davos switzerland has listed the increase in greenhouse gas emissions among
             the highest global risks in terms of likelihood in its annual global risk analysis in response to this
             increasingly pressing issue you have mapped out a vision to become a company that meets
             international anti global warming standards through advanced technologies and have conducted
             ongoing efforts centered on reducing emissions per production unit in the 2012 report you stated
             our resolve to proactively invest in energysaving measures energy conservation is an important
             csr objective in an industry which consumes a large amount of energy and also sends a positive
             message that the company is making efforts to improve its corporate value through improved
             productivity another area i would like to look at is your progress towards the vision for 2020 which
             you set as a future ideal from the perspective of recent trends such as scope 3 carbon
             accounting combating global warming no longer simply involves the single vector of reducing the
             smm groups ghg emissions given such developments i believe contribution through means
             such as environmentallyfriendly products will become increasingly important i hope you will
             promote the beneﬁts of combating climate change from a more comprehensive angle

  the smm groups main business of mining development carries the inherent risk of destruction of
  natural surroundings and environmental pollution if not conducted responsibly it is for this reason
  that our company has had a longheld belief that as a very minimum we must conduct our
  operations in ways that do not harm the livelihoods of local residents the natural environment or
  biodiversity based on this principle we have worked to promote energy conservation by improving
  the efﬁciency of our production equipment and processes and have now reached the stage where
  we are expanding our view to include the way energy is used and created and making necessary
  improvements
      in order to realize our vision for 2020 it is important that we consider the issues on a
  companywide level and change the way we approach problems in the future rather than each of
  the resources metals and materials divisions handling issues individually we will cooperate to
  tackle speciﬁc themes on a companywide level utilizing the strengths of each division we are
  also studying joint initiatives with other companies as necessary if our vision was represented by
  the peak of a mountain we are still only 30 up the slope the reason for this is because we have
  set our sights so high as we steadily advance our companywide initiatives i believe that each of
  our employees maintaining a strong awareness of environmental preservation in both their work
  and private lives will help us make major strides toward the peak

  trouble from spreading in case an incident did ever occur we are also installing a system that
  automatically shuts off the discharge if any abnormalities are detected in the wastewater port we will
  continue to control environmental risks properly and to strengthen our activities toward risk reduction

        a decline of about 5 kilotons from the previous year reasons                   mining waste generated by the mineral resources business
        for this decline include a drop in the amount of zinc slag                      such as topsoil spoil tailings and sludge
        generated at the harima smelter and an increase in the                             oxidization of rocks spoil containing sulﬁde minerals

             the human rights policy which was established in 2010 and a companywide pdca cycle activity that
             challenges the supply chain and communities where you conduct business as well as the organization
             itself are amazing initiatives and they are unique to the globallyexpanding smm group in japan the
             scope of human rights is often limited to a very narrow ﬁeld however i want every employee to
             recognize that respect for diversity is included in the right to be given opportunities based on ones
             ambition and ability regardless of nationality or gender and that improving ones worklife balance is
             included in the right to have a rewarding private life while doing a worthwhile job by so doing it is hoped
             that various possibilities will open up for each individual in terms of more opportunities for selfdevelopment sufﬁcient time to
             connect with society and minimization of the conﬂict between ones work responsibilities and family responsibilities such as
             nursing and childcare this will have a positive effect on society as a whole
                when human rights infringements do occur such as sexual harassment and the normal administrative channels cannot be
             used there are assistance functions in place such as directly reporting or consulting top management but are these
             procedures functioning in order for these procedures to be used effectively it is important that you publicize the usage
             method and promote the fact that those who use it will not be discriminated against you could even use csr reports to
             promote their use

  what this department requires from employees is that each one of us should be able to utilize a
  high awareness of human rights in order to act independently both inside and outside the
  company that is why in addition to the human rights education that has already been carried out
  the committee for the promotion of respect for human rights was established this spring and
  training has been conducted for all employees to be fully aware of the human rights policy in
  japan and overseas we have also started to examine the construction of a human rights due
  diligence structure for the entire smm group to supplement the human rights investigations taking
  place in each branch ofﬁce
      since 2012 we have put more effort into female career support and we have been promoting
  infrastructure supply and childcare leave systems while encouraging a change of attitude by
  means of lectures we will also be pushing ahead with the employment of disabled people going
  forward its clear that new initiatives to facilitate the lively employment of diverse personnel are in
  great demand which is the target for smm as a world leader in the nonferrous metals industry
  and as an excellent company of japan we hope that every employee will be individually
  motivated to take on appropriate challenges rather than just being part of company initiatives

             the japan mining industry association works to share information on and study health and safety
             related issues at its member companies through such organizations as the safety act sectional
             meeting safety and health subcommittee and safety site meeting
                 i always focus on the wishes of our important stakeholdersthe families of our employees and
             contractorswho want to see their family off every morning and hear himher cheerfully call out im
             home in the evening safety is therefore an issue that affects all of society
                 in addition to smms hazard training simulation zone at the ojikan facility and the jco study
             center from 2013 the company began holding safety training courses at the smm anzen dojyo i
             understand that the facility aims to vitalize group training at each business site by developing human
             resources who will play a central role in training and instructing others in workplace safety matters
             across the group i hope that graduates of the dojyo program will form their own ideas on what needs
             to be done to ensure safety in their own workplaces share these ideas with their managers and junior
             staff and take action to reform workplace safety initiatives
                 as smm works towards its vision for 2020 business operations at sites outside japan are likely to
             expand further in the future i would like to hear reports on the companys health and safety initiatives
             at its overseas sites

    it is of course essential that we protect the health and safety of all employees including those of our
    contractors and ultimately we aim to provide an environment where employees feel the joy and
    satisfaction of life through their work
        in 2012 there were 11 accidents at the group which was fewer than the target we set i believe this
    improvement is due to our progress in identifying problem areas and building a framework for data
    collection to create effective measures to prevent recurrence as well as improved awareness among
    employees that accidents are not acceptable emphasized by the heads of departments immediately
    rushing to the work ﬂoor when an accident occurs
        in the future as we aim toward zero occupational accidents i believe we must work to ensure
    employees have a strong awareness that they must prevent injuries to themselves and others we must
    also ensure that managers not only work to prevent recurrence of accidents and share information
    across group sites but also perform risk assessments to detect and prevent any possible accidents
    before they occur and create and operate safety initiative plans tailored to the situation at each
    workplace at the smm anzen dojyo which opened in march 2013 we will train students gathered from
    sites across the group in safety philosophy techniques and training methods to provide them with the
    skills to become safety leaders at their respective workplaces after they return by conducting
    highlevel safety initiatives tailored to each workplace we will work to achieve our vision for 2020

    it is vital that smm builds up a relationship that facilitates a free exchange of ideas with each of our
    eight stakeholders in japan and overseas including customers shareholders investors
    employees and local communities and that we achieve greater mutual understanding we
    currently have a consistent relationship but there are also some issues between us one issue is
    how to go about strengthening communication with local communities in overseas locations
    although a long history has been built up in japan that allows for continuous communication
    communication is still lacking overseas due to cultural differences and other issues in this ﬁscal
    year in particular we have put a lot of effort into strengthening ties with citizen groups by
    explaining our business activities and csr initiatives we can pass on a greater understanding of
    our company which will construct a better relationship with great mutual trust and cooperation
        the minor actions of each and every employee are fundamental to building a relationship of
    mutual trust with stakeholders i would like you all to work while keeping in mind the idea that
    everything you do represents the company

          groups employees                                                                their hopes and expectations for smm employees
         i felt that including the perspectives of employees from each                   included a special feature on smms quality philosophy

          readable although the report included outlines of each                          activities of many workplaces and clearly explained how
          initiative i think that including more detailed information on                  our business relates to social issues

          would beneﬁt readers even more

          would be easier for readers if information was summarized                   reducing the amount of text and including more photographs
          into key points and more charts and photographs were                        on each page
          included
