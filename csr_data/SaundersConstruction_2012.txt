conservation is a statewide priority for all
businesses residing in colorado at saunders

in the realm of waste reduction saunders has
been successful at

    increasing the number of our jobsites that
     have recycling programs from 70 in 2010
     to 92 in 2011

    diverting more of the waste produced in our
     corporate offices and on our jobsites from
     landfill



2012 waste reduction goals

waste reduction at saunders will continue to
remain a primary focus through 2016 when
we aim to recycle almost all of the waste
produced at each jobsite

we also plan to continue this trajectory as
follows
