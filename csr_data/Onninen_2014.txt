packaging materials
for recovery
according to the nature of wholesaling onninen unloads and repackages the packages
of its suppliers therefore onninens operations produce packaging waste and raise the
need to obtain and use packaging materials

waste is always transported                      hazardous waste includes waste that
to the correct location                          national legislation defines as hazardous
waste that is generated in onninens             waste at its point of generation the
operations is mainly packaging material         treatment of hazardous waste is always
such as cardboard boxes and plastic wrapping     performed by an external company however
from unpacking supplier deliveries most of      figures between different operating countries
the waste is generated in the distribution       are not fully comparable because there are
centers two thirds of the total volume of       differences in whether or not hazardous
waste is generated in the distribution centers   waste passes through onninen when
and the steel warehouse the remaining one       delivered from the customer to processing
third of the total waste volume is generated     if hazardous waste  passes through onninen
in express outlets and offices                  it can be seen in onninens statistics
                                                   
information about waste management covers        nearly all waste is recycled
all distribution centers the steel warehouse   waste for recovery is sorted at onninen
and more than 90 of onninen express outlets     this includes cardboard plastic wood
and offices at some sites waste management     metal and other fractions that are sorted at

                                                 to recover waste

landfill waste includes the rest of the waste   used portable batteries and accumulators
that is not sorted at onninen the volume of    to all onninen express outlets onninens
landfill waste has been reduced by 17         partners take care of final processing

the total waste recovery of all onninen         need for packaging
operations is 87 to reduce the volume         materials increasing
of waste and to develop waste sorting to        the material onninen uses is mainly
enable waste recovery have been longterm       packaging material such as cardboard boxes
targets at onninen compared to 2012 some      and plastic wrapping for shipping products
improvement is visible but especially when     to customers statistics related to material
taking the longer term into consideration      use are reported for onninens operations
the recovery percentage has increased           in finland sweden norway poland russia
significantly                                  and the baltic countries every country has

electrical and electronic products             of the material is used
portable batteries and accumulators
onninens customers purchase and use            the total volume of purchased packaging
electrical and electronic products as well     materials is approximately 1300 1090
as portable batteries and accumulators         tonnes compared with the previous year
after the life cycle of these products         the total volume has increased
proper recovery is essential to secure
proper possibilities for recovery onninen      the eu packaging directive stipulates that
is a member of and cooperates with local        companies are responsible for the recovery
recycling associations or companies            of packages delivered to the domestic

138 properties under

at the end of 2013 onninen group had 138        weather conditions explain changes
properties in use of which 44 are in finland   in energy consumption
18 in sweden 28 in norway 33 in poland        the changes in energy consumption are
4 in russia 10 in the baltic countries and 1    mainly due to changes in weather conditions
in shanghai china the total area of these      even though weather conditions explain the
properties was approximately 325000 m¬≤         biggest changes a lot of action has also been
some of the properties are owned by onvest       taken to reduce energy consumption the
oy and leased to onninen oy while others        effect of these efforts can be seen in long

energy consumption is reported from the          action to decrease energy consumption has
distribution centers in finland sweden         been countryspecific for example the
norway poland russia and the baltic            consumption of heating energy by the finnish
countries the energy consumption of             distribution center has decreased significantly

80 or more of the sites in the country         systems were modified the consumption of
heating energy is included in the rent in        heating energy also continued to fall in the
many properties in finland sweden norway       distribution center in russia
and russia which is why the total energy
consumption of expresses and offices is          water consumption is not addressed in the
reported only from poland and the baltic         report because it is not considered to be a
countries                                       key figure in terms of onninens operations


energy consumption is reduced

emissions into the air
from heating and
transportation
onninens operations produce greenhouse           the delivery method distribution center
gas emissions that have an impact on global       cross dock or direct sales is chosen on
warming mainly through the production of          the basis of efficiency and customer need
the electricity and heat energy required by       by combining the distribution center and
properties and through fuel consumption           cross dock sales deliveries onninen ensures
in transportation operations                     efficient transportation to customers and
                                                  reduces emissions direct sales deliveries
monitoring of energy consumption covers           are reasonable when the delivered

countries from express outlets and offices
energy consumption is partly available           each onninen country has at least one
