     messages from outside directors

      maintaining a sense of affection towards kagome while looking at them strictly
      in modern society that is developed by economic activity such as investment by individuals and through the
      work of economic organizations companies that serve as engines of the economy must be good corporate
      citizens in that they return profits to society it is only when equipped with such qualities that companies
      can claim to possess governance however sometimes organizations can be overly tied to their own past
      be both inwardlooking and conservative and accordingly they fail to fully meet the requirements of social
      justice for this reason while remaining at arms length they require individuals who monitor their activities
      and provide appropriate advice i believe this idea defines precisely the role of the outside director
          i will do my utmost to fulfill my responsibilities as an outside director by learning as much as i can about
      kagome i will closely watch the companys activities so as to provide frank opinions even if such views are
      not necessarily what senior management wants to hear

  in addition to the effects of fuel conversion we have made
further efforts by jointly developing an lng cold energy utiliza
tion system with the tokyo gas group we have introduced
this system with the aim of achieving further energy savings
using the cold energy of lng
  with this system energy use is reduced as the running of the
refrigerators and cooling towers can be restrained by using the
162c cold energy of lng to cool the coolant for refrigerators

   a co 2 emissions reduction of approximately 2000t is

      recycling center
kagome sets up recycling centers on the premises of its plants
to recycle production byproducts
  for example the fujimi plant painstakingly separates such
materials as drum and plastictype raw material containers
and scrap metal into 63 classifications within 19 categories
these recycled materials are carefully stored until they can be
collected by respective vendors in addition placing these cen
ters in locations that are highly visible from outside the plants
ensures that stored materials are correctly separated and                   nasu plants recycling center

biodiversity protection
   basic approach to biodiversity protection
in the course of its long history kagome has developed a wide
variety of products based on natures myriad gifts such as
tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables kagome seeks to
contribute to the wellbeing and longevity of people worldwide
by offering products that maximize the benefits of natures
bounty
  farmland biodiversity helps nurture these gifts of nature
biodiversity is secured through proper ecosystem maintenance
with regard to farmland forest and other natural settings as a
food company kagome knows the extreme importance of eco               a tomato farm maintained by kagome

systems and biodiversity highquality crops can be grown only
on farmland that is host to the healthy existence of a diversity
of life the ongoing viability of such farmland depends on us
human beings
  protecting ecosystems and biodiversitythis will continue to
be one of kagomes most significant commitments



   promoting sustainable agriculture through contract cultivation
in japan kagome produces tomatoes used as ingredients
in juice and other processed products through contract
cultivation
  in contract tomato cultivation purchase prices are deter
mined through negotiations with contract farmers before cul
tivation even begins after harvest kagome purchases the full
yield from the contract farms to ensure yield levels kagome
provides the farmers with tomato seeds and seedlings and
offers cultivation guidance this frees farmers to concentrate          juice tomato cultivation policy explanatory meeting for
on cultivation and in turn to stabilize their farm management        contract farmers

  in recent years japan is seeing its population of farm
ers aging with advancing age farm maintenance becomes
more difficult in response kagome is promoting technologi
cal advances toward automated harvesting moreover we
are accelerating the development of easytoharvest tomato
varieties such as those whose hull remains on the stem when
picked by helping lessen the physical burden on farmers we
are helping farmers to continue cultivating tomatoes
  farmland biodiversity can be maintained only through proper
use and management therefore by supporting farmers in                 tomato harvester

remaining in tomato businesses kagome is helping to curb the
increase in farmland lying fallow while contributing to the sus
tainability of farmland that supports rich ecosystems

tomato varietiesa size that makes it a worldleading private
sector database to establish this database we collected the
seeds of tomato varieties with distinctive genetic characteris
tics drawing on this database we promote plant breeding to
create new useful tomato varieties
  these seeds are stored at a specified temperature and
humidity however aging deteriorates their germination rates            tomato seeds                             tomato seed library at the kagome

therefore they are periodically updated these meticulous
steps are required to maintain our genetic information data
base on tomatoes certain genetic information on wild and
other tomato varieties is provided to public and other research
institutions as such the kagome research institute functions
somewhat like a gene bank
  also we reevaluate the genetic information that we collect            wideranging tomato varieties created
the results of such reevaluations are used to develop new                 based on our rich genetic resources




   eliminating the use of nonindigenous bee species for pollination
kagome started the production and sale of fresh tabletop
tomatoes in 1998 unlike tomatoes for processed products
which are grown outdoors tabletop tomatoes are grown inside
greenhouses where wind pollination is not possible and so we
use bees for pollination in may 2004 immediately after the
nonindigenous bumblebees we had been using were desig
nated an invasive alien species we replaced the entire stock             kagomes mega greenhouse

with native black bumblebees at the three greenhouses in
japan under our direct control our five other greenhouses
constructed after these three have used the native bees from
the start at the time no largescale breeding technologies
had been established for these native bees kagome sup
ported technological development even though the native
bees impact on tomato quality and economic viability was not             native black bumblebees

then clear the relevant technologies have since been devel
oped and today such bees are supplied for tomato cultivation
throughout japan



   teaching children the preciousness of life through tomato cultivation
since 1999 kagome has distributed lylyco juice tomato seed
lings to elementary schools kindergartens and preschools
nationwide schools use these seedlings as educational mate

   introducing paperbased containers for tomato condiments
since march 2013 kagome has been promoting a switchover
to using paperbased containers for a number of its tomato
based products including mainstay kagome cut tomatoes for
cooking and kagome tomato sauce as well as newly released
tomato  basil topping sauce the use of these containers
helps reduce environmental impact in multiple ways the paper
is recyclable the volume of co2 emissions generated through
the manufacture and transportation of these containers is
smaller than that associated with metal tins and paperbased             tomato  basil topping sauce      kagome tomato sauce

containers can be flattened after use thereby helping reduce
the bulk of waste along with producing shelfstable products
using these containers the company utilizes such media as its
corporate website to propose cooking methods that entail no
heating rather users can just add and season these kagome
products to taste just before dining in these ways kagome is
striving to reduce the environmental burden posed by its prod
ucts even at the consumption stage while helping customers
enjoy a hasslefree cooking
  going forward kagome will work to make its tomatoes even
tastier while proposing great tomato recipes that are easy and            kagome cut tomatoes for cooking   reverse side

fun to cook to that end the company will make the most
of paperbased containers properties thereby creating new
valueadded tomato related products

   environmentfriendly product and system rd




   easily recyclable packaging
kagome has proactively adopted cardboard packaging
because cardboard boasts a stable high recycling rate backed
by established recycling systems although previously most of
kagomes gift products were packaged in presentation boxes
the company has begun using a box top made of cardboard
for some of these products looking to promote maximum
recycling the company includes instructions on the side of the            a gift box sent as a special share
gift boxes on how to fold them for recycling in addition for gift        holder benefit

environmental impact
 energy saving and co2 reduction
while greenhouse uses heating to keep the temperature suit
able for cultivation environmentallyfriendly lng is used as the
heat source the co2 produced during combustion is recov
ered and effectively utilized to aid photosynthesis which is
essential to tomato growth supplementing this the company
also uses liquefied co2 derived from the emissions of external
petrochemical and oil refinery companies which further facili
tates photosynthesis and thereby increases crop yield while                liquefied co2 storage installed       compost production facility
reducing its need for lp gas in addition kagome pursues                  at a farm

efforts aimed at effectively using natural energy sources for
example we satisfy a portion of the electricity needs of the
hibikinada greenfarm by sourcing electricity from a nearby
largescale solar power plant
 water resource conservation
kagome promotes the effective utilization and recycling of                                                                 co2 produced by lp gas to heat green

reuse of nutriculture and culture media and other materials

the use of synthetic pesticides is minimized by taking early
countermeasures that involve preventing insects from entering
greenhouses and monitoring the outbreak of insects on a daily
