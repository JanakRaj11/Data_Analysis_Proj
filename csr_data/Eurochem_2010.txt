the response
to the crisis


in 2009 despite adverse economic conditions the company
        did not stop production at its plants




                                                                                                                                                     sustainable
        increased fertilizer production and sales volume

        continued implementing investment projects

        neither decreased wages nor performed mass layoffs

        created new jobs




adverse economic
conditions in 2009
t
      he key trend during the crisis was a           in addition russian railways increased tariffs   for more details on 2009 market conditions
      reduction in demand and prices for the         on railroad shipments for all types of products   see the chapter our market drivers
      companys products both in russian and         two times during the year

quarter of 2008 and actually remained at this low    fertilizers ahead of the 2009 spring planting
level during 2009 demand and prices started         season instead their existing stocks andor
to recover only in the 4th quarter of 2009 as a     decreasing overall fertilizer application
result the consolidated revenue of the company
decreased by 34 and net profit  by 25 times     the rapid decline in demand contributed to
                                                     increased competition among global fertilizer
prices of raw materials for fertilizer production    producers
decreased gradually during the entire first
half of 2009 while prices for fertilizers rapidly
decreased even at the end of 2008 as a
result at the end of 2008 and in early 2009
production of phosphate fertilizers became
lossmaking and the profitability in the
nitrogen segment decreased rapidly the price
of natural gas the main raw material increased
on average by 14 compared with 2008
