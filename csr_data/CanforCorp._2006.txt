no matter how big the
challenge the opportunity is
always bigger it was this attitude
that best reflects canfor in 2005
without a doubt 2005 was a year
of challenges but not only did we
take on these challenges head
on  we made them opportunities
an opportunity to become more
efficient an opportunity to become
more resourceful but most of all
2005 provided us an opportunity to
reveal the collective strength and
value of our company

dear fellow shareholders

with every challenge comes opportunity
in 2005 those companies who were
able to create opportunities enjoyed
some success in what was otherwise
a disappointing year for the forest
products sector at canfor we made
opportunities for ourselves and managed
what can be considered a respectable
year given the circumstances it is
during these downtimes that one can
truly see the value in a company where
its strengths and weaknesses are and
of course the dedication of its people

wildlife and habitat management
in 2005 canfors coastal operations completed a biodiversity conservation plan the goal of this plan is to keep common
species common the plan outlines measures taken to conserve all species and monitoring strategies to ensure the
effectiveness of the plan the goal for 2006 is to develop a biodiversity conservation plan for at least one bc northern
interior division
     canfor has been actively involved in planning for caribou habitat management throughout our tenures as an
example we began developing a boreal caribou conservation plan in partnership with bc ministry of environment for
fort nelson and fort st john divisions in 2005 the expected completion date is december 2006


coast forest conservation initiative
canfor has been a member of the coast forest conservation initiative cfci since it began in 1999 cfci is a collaboration
among four british columbiabased forest companies dedicated to the sustainable development and conservation of
coastal forests cfci members have been in dialogue with environmental groups forestethics greenpeace rainforest
action network and the sierra club of canada bc chapter in a forum known as the joint solutions project jsp
     the cfci and its environmental group collaborators in the jsp generated a workable package of solutions
regarding conservation and forest management which served as the basis of consensus recommendations reached by
the central coast and north coast land and resource management plan planning tables in 2003 and 2004 respectively
the recommendations were forwarded to the provincial government which entered into discussions with first nations
in the region prior to a final land use plan decision by the provincial cabinet
     in february 2006 the provincial government announced the land use decision which will establish over 100 new
protected areas raising the total protected area for the central and north coast to 18 million hectares the decision
also establishes biodiversity areas to maintain ecological diversity and function while allowing for some resource
development the balance of the plan area over 65 will allow the full range of economic uses while applying a new
adaptive approach of ecosystembased management ebm the intent of ebm is to support a sustainable economy
while protecting ecosystems and to promote stability certainty and longterm resource use in the region


certification
canfor continues to be a leader in thirdparty sustainable forest management certification of its forestry operations
     during 2005 canfor maintained existing certification to the csa sustainable forest management sfm standard
on its tree farm licence at prince george its forest licence in the morice timber supply area tsa and its forest
licence and pulpwood agreement in the fort st john tsa canfors tree farm licences at chetwynd and on vancouver
island and its grande prairie forest management agreement were recertified to the csa sfm standard for another
threeyear term new csa sfm standard certifications were obtained for canfors tree farm licence and forest
licence at vavenby its forest licence and pulpwood agreement at fort nelson and its forest licences at vanderhoof

the iso 14001 standard was recertified to the replacement 2004 version of the iso standard


compliance with regulations
canfor is committed to transparency in our environmental reporting and includes compliance reporting as part of this
process the following is an inventory of compliance for canfors forestry operations
     during 2005 a total of 23 noncompliance incidents occurred on company tenures in all cases canfor promptly
took necessary actions to mitigate any environmental consequences and correct conditions that may have led to the
incident
     canfor forestry operations reported 10 spills to government agencies in 2005 9 in british columbia and 1 in
alberta eight of the spills were the result of equipment failure and two were the result of accidents all spills were
minor in nature and were properly managed and contained

compliance report


canfor is committed to transparency in our environmental reporting and includes compliance reporting as part of this
process the following is an inventory of compliance for canfors wholly owned manufacturing operations
     in 2005 canfor had the following noncompliance situations reported in accordance with government non
compliance reporting criteria


air  at sawmills beehive burners operated below approval temperature as follows one for thirtythree days this issue

has been largely resolved with installation of a fuel reclaim system for the burner one for ten days due to inadequate
fuel to maintain temperature this issue has been resolved with changes in operating regime of the burner one for four
days three of which were due to cold weather one for two days due to damper controls failure one for one day one
burner failed to meet the monthly temperature requirement due to problems with cogeneration startup the burner has
since been shut down with operation of the cogeneration facility one complaint was received regarding flyash from a
burner one burner failed to meet smoke opacity limits due to a power outage one boiler failed to meet smoke opacity
limits due to an equipment issue one sawmill failed to submit monthly burner reports and dustfall test results for
several months in 2005 one sawmill failed to submit an annual report for burner operations for 2004
     at board facilities one osb plant was issued a ticket for open burning in the plant yard that occurred when a load
of hot board from the press was pulled outside and caught fire
     at pulpmill operations particulate emissions from a power boiler exceeded the permit limit by 3


effluent  at pulpmills composite effluent samples were not taken for two days one monthly qaqc requirement for

total suspended solids was not performed
     at a plywood plant the annual report required by the effluent permit was submitted after the due date


landfill  at sawmills one landfill report was submitted after the due date

     at a plywood plant the annual report required by the landfill permit was submitted after the due date


spills  canfor manufacturing operations had 9 reportable spills in 2005 all were contained cleaned up and preventive

actions taken the spills were all to ground and included four spills of process water two spills of thermal oil one spill
of hydraulic fluid one spill of pulp process liquor and one spill of pulp effluent


performance versus objectives in 2005


air quality
objective  as a result of the prince george pulpmill 48mw power project particulate matter and total reduced sulphur

emissions will be reduced with the upgrade of environmental controls at the smeltdissolving stack and with the
conversion of the recovery boiler to a low odoremitting boiler two beehive burners in nearby communities will also be
shut down as a result of the project

performance  the last major stage of the power project was implemented in december 2005 with installation of

a second precipitator on the recovery boiler preliminary indications are that targets for particulate reduction will
be met reductions in total reduced sulphur have exceeded expectations one tier 1 beehive burner has been
permanently shut down and one other burner shut down with provisions to run on an as needed basis to balance wood
residue inventories


ems for wood products
objectives 

     hold a one day session in may for environmental coordinators that do not have previous ems experience
     begin development of basic elements of ems at new canfor wood products operations including developing site
      specific environmental aspects environmental objectives and targets and programs and conducting management
      reviews


performance  the ems session for environmental coordinators was attended by representatives from every new

canfor operation and by all that were newly appointed to the position the program included an overview of an ems as
defined by iso 14001 as well as an exercise in identifying and ranking site environmental aspects
      all new canfor wood products operations have developed a sitespecific registry of ranked environmental aspects
set targets for 2006 and held a management review


ems for tmp mill
objectives 

     develop an aspect registry
     set objectives and targets
     develop environmental programs


performance  the tmp mill has developed an aspect registry with environmental risks ranked according to severity

probability and countermeasures targets have been set for the higher ranked aspects for completion in 2006 the
development of environmental programs will continue in 2006 for high priority environmental aspects


thermal oil systems
objective  we will work with council of forest industries toward the development of an approved training program for

operators of thermal oil systems


performance  increasing sawmill production and increasing energy costs have resulted in more thermal oil systems in

the province rather than a custom training program for operators of thermal oil systems the bc safety authority has
recommended that the minister endorse a reclassification of these systems the existing requirements do not reflect
the risk level of thermal oil systems

wood residue management
objective  we will continue to develop economically viable solutions to meet tier 1 burner phase out requirements and

create value from our wood residue


performance  in mid2005 one of canfors three remaining tier 1 burners was permanently shut down with surplus

wood residue going to the prince george pulpmill power project a second tier 1 burner will be phased out by the end
of 2007 with a 56 million energy system and joint venture pellet plant project we are working towards a solution for
the final tier 1 burner involving a barkfired energy system and whitewood utilization by third parties


audits
objective  we will conduct corporate environmental audits of three pulp mills six sawmill operations one osb plant

one plywood plant and one remanufacturing plant


performance  audits were conducted as planned with the exception of two sawmills which were sold in early 2005




                                c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n   5   s u s ta i n a b i l i t y r e p o r t 2 0 0 5

objectives and targets for 2006


the following are corporate level objectives and targets for 2006


air quality
we will contribute to airshed research in prince george so that air quality improvement can be accelerated through cost
effective management actions


ems
we will provide environmental coordinators of our operations with the knowledge and resources required to achieve
continual improvement reduce the frequency of noncompliance incidents and minimize impact on the environment
three key areas of focus are
     training of new environmental coordinators
     support for further development of environmental management systems
     managing the 2006 audit program for maximum benefit to auditors and operations


drinking water
we will support canfors drinking water system operators with
     regulatory updates
     drinking water audit protocol used at all environmental audits
     on site inspections for operations that have not previously been visited by engineers qualified to assess potable
      water systems


wood residue management
we will finalize and implement phase out plans for canfors remaining tier 1 burners


audits
we will conduct corporate environmental audits of seven sawmill operations and two remanufacturing plants

2005 compared to 2004


2004 was a year of exceptionally good market conditions and canfor achieved record earnings of 4155 million 2005 was a more
challenging year with a stronger canadian dollar lower average prices lumber down 10 plywood 27 and osb 14 transportation
challenges mill closures and other production downtime
           severe cold weather in early january 2005 created operational difficulties resulting in lower production and increased unit costs in
the sawmills and pulp mills the plateau sawmill rebuild project resulted in reduced production in the third and fourth quarters osb
production was significantly reduced in the fourth quarter as a result of a major equipment failure and startup issues at polarboard
           railcar shortages in the first quarter of 2005 severely limited shipment volumes of all products in that period in the first half of the
third quarter a strike by the container truckers at the port of vancouver hampered offshore shipments of lumber and pulp
           in 2005 pretax restructuring costs of 53 million 42 million after tax were incurred which included 38 million of closure
costs for the tackama and hines creek sawmills and severance and other costs of 15 million restructuring costs of 365 million
before tax 288 million after tax were incurred in 2004 as a result of the integration of slocan after its combination with canfor these
costs included 186 million of severance 107 million of mill closure costs and 72 million of asset writedowns and lease costs

 at the average value of the canadian dollar for the year as noted above




as the majority of canfors sales are to us customers the strengthening of the canadian dollar since 2003 has significantly reduced
revenues and net income particularly in 2005 when the dollar averaged 825 cents which was its highest level since 1992

the main factors affecting the comparability of the results over the last eight quarters were the integration of the former slocan
operations as of april 1 2004 changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar which impact us dollar revenues and
the translation of us dollar denominated longterm debt and changes in lumber pulp plywood and osb prices as highlighted in the
table above
      onetime items that had a significant impact on quarterly results include restructuring and mill closure provisions of 183 million
03 million and 102 million in the second third and fourth quarters of 2004 respectively 16 million in the second quarter of 2005
and 25 million in the third quarter of 2005 all figures are after tax the second quarter 2005 results were reduced by a 40 million

aftertax loss on the sale of the fort st james slocan and valemount sawmills which was subsequently increased by 07 million in
the fourth quarter the third quarter 2005 results were negatively impacted by an 89 million aftertax writedown of timber licenses
which was subsequently reduced to 62 million after tax in the fourth quarter in the third quarter of 2005 the bc corporate income tax
rate was reduced by 15 which resulted in a 210 million favourable adjustment to the current and future income tax liability being
recorded in the period the fourth quarter 2005 results were reduced by a 52 million aftertax expense for the executive longterm
incentive plan and by 18 million of bad debt severance and lease terminations costs related to coastal operations 09 million in the
second quarter favourable items affecting the fourth quarter 2005 results include 89 million of income from the seaboard general
partnership and 20 million of scientific research and development tax credits claimed
     canfors financial results are impacted by seasonal factors such as weather and building activity adverse weather conditions can
cause logging curtailments which can affect the supply of raw materials to sawmills plywood and osb plants and pulp mills market
demand also varies seasonally to some degree for example building activity and repair and renovation work which affect demand for
lumber and panel products are generally stronger in the spring and summer months shipment volumes are affected by these factors
as well as by global supply and demand conditions shortages in railcar supply had an adverse impact on shipment volumes in the first
quarter of 2005 and also in the first three quarters of 2004 a container truckers strike at the port of vancouver impacted offshore
shipments in the third quarter of 2005


fourth quarter results


an operating loss of 147 million and a net loss of 123 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with operating
income of 203 million and net income of 430 million in the fourth quarter of 2004
     the main reasons for the decrease in earnings were the strengthening of the canadian dollar which averaged 4 stronger in the
fourth quarter of 2005 than in the same period in 2004 and lower prices for lumber 3 lower plywood 14 lower and pulp 1 lower
partially offset by a 22 increase in osb prices although the dollar strengthened in the fourth quarter the closing value was weaker
than it had been at the end of the third quarter which resulted in a 47 million loss on the translation of longterm debt for the fourth
quarter in comparison a 361 million gain on the translation of longterm debt was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004

     the lumber segment reported an operating loss of 131 million in the quarter compared to operating income of 166 million
     in the same period in 2004 lower shipments volumes of canforproduced lumber in addition to the unfavourable exchange and
     price factors noted above and lower chip revenues as a result of lower chip prices implemented in the third quarter were the main
     reasons for the weaker financial performance production of 10499 million board feet was 15 lower than in 2004 mainly as a
     result of the closure of the tackama and hines creek sawmills in 2005 and reduced operations at the plateau sawmill in order to
     complete that facilitys strategic upgrade project

     the panels segment reported an operating loss of 27 million in the quarter compared to operating income of 199 million in the
     fourth quarter of 2004 lower plywood prices and higher energy costs factored into the poor results and although osb prices were
     25 higher in the fourth quarter of 2005 the impact was more than offset by lower shipment volumes a major equipment failure
     at the polarboard osb mill occurred in november 2005 and an 11day emergency shutdown was taken to repair the equipment and
     to complete other maintenance work that had been planned for early 2006 the shutdown resulted in additional costs of 35 million
     and 16 million square feet of lost osb production in the quarter the new osb joint venture in fort st john which is proportionately
     consolidated in canfors results began production in late december 2005 and incurred a loss of 08 million as a result of the low
     production volumes during the mills startup phase

     the pulp and paper segment earned operating income of 168 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with an operating
     loss of 101 million in the same quarter in 2004 when compared with last year the impact of lower prices and a stronger canadian
     dollar in the fourth quarter of 2005 was more than offset by the favourable impact of the lower chip prices lower energy costs
     resulting from the new cogeneration facility a 23 million scientific research and development tax credit and 14 million of
     forward contract hedging gains




                  c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 0 5   25   m a n a g e m e n t  s d i s c u s s i o n a n d a n a ly s i s

     corporate costs were 157 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 61 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 the main
     factors contributing to the higher costs in the fourth quarter were a 65 million accrual for the executive longterm incentive
     plan related to the last two fiscal years 10 million of severance costs and higher donations consulting fees and employee
     relocation costs

     other income of 79 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 was mainly comprised of 89 million of seaboard general partnership
     income partially offset by 13 million of other equity losses in the fourth quarter of 2004 other expense of 07 million included
     a 30 million writeoff of project costs partially offset by 23 million of equity income also in the fourth quarter of 2005 a 23
     million favourable adjustment was recorded to the timber takeback loss of 111 million recorded in the third quarter



2005 operating results


the following discussion of canfors operating results relates to the operating segments and the nonsegmented items as per the
segmented information note in the financial statements canfors operations include the following three operating segments lumber

ebitda declined by 2437 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 market factors and exchange negatively impacted earnings by 3560
million with the benchmark 2x4 2  better lumber price decreasing by 10 in 2005 or 16 when expressed in canadian dollars
adding to these external factors was the negative impact of lower chip marketbased pricing implemented on july 1 2005 this change
resulted in an unfavourable income variance of 320 million in the lumber segment as compared to 2004 but was largely offset by the
reduced chip costs in the pulp and paper segment

operating performance
positive trends were experienced in a number of key performance indicators relative to 2004 despite continuing input cost pressures
smaller log size and declining log quality resulting from increased beetle harvest improvements were seen in production 9 increase
over 2004 prime grade production improved by 7 and total manufacturing costs 2 reduction over 2004 the majority of these
improvements were realized once the startup curves associated with capital upgrades at the houston prince george quesnel and
fort st john sawmills were complete noncapital driven initiatives accounted for the remaining performance improvements with an
emphasis on quality and optimization programs developed through 2004 and implemented early in 2005 although fuel and energy costs
rose by 9 and labour costs increased by 3 as compared to 2004 total unit manufacturing costs were down 2 this result was driven
by a 7 reduction in maintenance spending in combination with the abovenoted productivity gains log costs decreased by 2 in 2005
over 2004 mainly because of the increased harvesting of lower grade logs lumber recovery improved by 1 over 2004 as best practices
for quality and optimization are being continually implemented throughout canfors operations and are showing positive results
     extremely cold temperatures in the first two weeks of january affected production volumes and recoveries at most of the sawmills
however by early february productivity had improved significantly with production records being set at several mills picketing action
during the log haulers dispute in the prince george area resulted in oneday production stoppages at each of the houston plateau
isle pierre and polar sawmills in the first quarter lumber operations performed well in the second quarter with key performance
indicators improving significantly over the first quarter largely as a result of milder weather conditions and a strong focus on continuous
improvement production decreased in the third quarter as a result of maintenance shutdowns at several threeshift operations
curtailments at specific locations to balance inventories and a 10day shutdown for capital installations at the plateau sawmill work
continued through the fourth quarter on the plateau strategic expansion primary equipment was in place and testing substantially
complete by the end of the year capital spending startup and project benefits are all anticipated to be at or near expectation with
the significantly reduced operations at the plateau sawmill and seasonal downtime at other mills production in the fourth quarter
decreased by 7
     railcar supply was a major issue impacting shipment volumes in the first quarter of 2005 however shipment volumes improved
in the second quarter as a result of increased demand during the active building season and efficiencies in supply through improved rail
car availability and the scheduling of marine shipments to transport product to canfors major us customers

mill closures  dispositions
     the sale of the fort st james sawmill and related tenures which was required by the competition bureau as a condition to the
     slocan acquisition in 2004 was completed in the second quarter

     the highcost valemount and slocan operations were also sold in the second quarter

     because of the increasing demand on albertas fibre supply canfor determined that the availability of timber for harvest was not
     sufficient to sustain both of its two operations in that province as a result in the third quarter canfor permanently closed its hines
     creek operation in order to focus the amount of fibre available for processing at its grande prairie facility

     the highcost tackama sawmill in fort nelson was permanently closed in september

     mill closure costs of 38 million were recorded in the year mainly related to the tackama sawmill as well as some final costs for
the closure of the hines creek operation in 2004 mill closure costs of 161 million were recorded related to the closures of the taylor
upper fraser and hines creek sawmills and the quesnel specialty mill closure costs associated with the fort st james valemount and
slocan operations were recorded in discontinued operations


countervailing cvd and antidumping add duties
in the current year canfor expensed combined cvd and add duties of 2248 million 2004  2762 million and has paid combined duty
deposits of us 7334 million since the inception of cvd and add in may 2002
     in december 2005 after completing its administrative review for the period from may 2003 to april 2004 por2 the us department
of commerce doc determined a cvd assessment rate of 870 for all canadian companies for por2 and an add assessment rate for
canfor of 136 subsequently corrected by the doc in january 2006 to 135 cash deposits on lumber shipments after december 12
2005 are being made at these lower rates
     at december 31 2005 canfor had accrued additional cvd of 674 million in excess of the cash deposits made included in
other accruals and provisions on the balance sheet and had accrued 1137 million of cumulative add cash deposits in excess of
the calculated expense included in longterm investments and other on the balance sheet canfor has not adjusted the previously
expensed duties to reflect the lower revised rates as noted above due to the uncertainty over the timing of receipt of refunds
     a comprehensive discussion of the history and current status of the duties is included in the risks and uncertainties section of
this document


markets
2005 was another outstanding year for the us housing market new records for home sales singlefamily starts and residential
remodeling were set in 2005 relatively low interest rates steady income growth and positive consumer confidence resulted in the
construction of 206 million new homes which is a 6 increase from 2004 this is the highest level since 1972 singlefamily housing
starts increased to a historical high of 17 million units and as a proportion of total housing starts increased from 82 in 2004 to 88
in 2005 as a result sales volumes in 2005 to canfors key professional dealer customers increased by 15 over 2004 while the overall

     another aspect of the strong housing market was the record amount spent in the repair and remodeling industry resulting from
very high levels of existing home sales in 2005 continuing low interest rates motivated many homeowners to refinance their mortgages
and consequently increase their spending even though the refinancing activity was lower than in 2004 the combined increase in
spending and the appreciation in housing prices provided strong incentives for homeowners to invest in renovating their existing homes
as a result canfors sales to the growing home centre segment remained strong at 16 of total shipments
     after the two hurricanes in the us gulf coast in the third quarter the immediate focus was on the construction of temporary
shelters for those residents who lost their homes this activity fuelled much of the demand for lumber and panel products during this
period largescale reconstruction efforts are expected to continue over the next few years
     lumber sales to japan during the second half of 2005 were stronger than during the first half of the year which contributed to
a shortage of jgrade lumber in the fourth quarter the lengthy independent container truckers strike in vancouver during the third
quarter prevented container shipments to japan despite this canfors overall market share in japan increased in 2005 canfors
continued sales and marketing efforts in china malaysia indonesia and vietnam have increased shipments by 10 over 2004 this was
achieved despite two months of shipment reductions due to the container strike in 2005 total offshore sales represented 7 of canfors
lumber shipments
     despite the strong demand the competitive position of canadian producers was reduced due to the canadian dollar appreciating
by 7 against the us dollar in 2005 and the continuing countervailing and antidumping duties on exports to the united states


risks and uncertainties
stumpage rates  as part of its forestry revitalization plan the provincial government is considering changes to the bc interior

stumpage system which are expected to come into effect in april 2006 the impact of these changes to canfor if any is not quantifiable
at this time


mountain pine beetle mpb  the mountain pine beetle continues to pose a significant threat to the lodgepole pine forests in the interior

regions of british columbia a significant portion of this infestation is within canfors operating areas lodgepole pine accounts for 25
of the total timber volume harvested in british columbia and more than 50 of the total timber volume harvested by canfor
     the mountain pine beetle infestation in british columbia now impacts approximately 411 million cubic metres of lodgepole pine
and has spread at a rate that has averaged approximately 59 per year for the last five years the quesnel prince george morice and
lakes timber supply areas tsas all integral to canfor manufacturing facilities continue to be the most heavily impacted in addition
the infestation also impacts at least seven other tsas in which canfor operates including the kamloops mackenzie and dawson creek
tsas although the levels of attack are still relatively low the rate of spread in the dawson creek tsa is high and it does present a risk
to the chetwynd operation there is also a risk of entry of mountain pine beetle into canfors alberta forest management agreement
area which is approximately 40 lodgepole pine this risk has resulted in an ongoing joint effort by canfor the ministry of forests 
range weyerhaeuser and the alberta government to attempt to suppress the beetle in the dawson creek tsa

     canfor is working with the ministry of forests  range and other operators in several areas to implement an aggressive program
to mitigate the spread of infestation by redirecting planned timber development to infected regions over the next five years this has
resulted in nearly 85 of the current wood supply to canfors prince george area mills being comprised of beetle harvest
     the average diameter of affected lodgepole pine logs tends to be smaller than traditional harvests and requires some realignment
and retooling of manufacturing facilities in the prince george region to fit with the changing fibre supply in the shortterm canfor is
assessing appropriate capital expenditures to realign its prince george area manufacturing capabilities to accommodate the increase
in fibre from beetleinfested logs if the outbreak continues to spread the potential implications for canfor include an eventual reduced
fibre supply a change in lumber product mix increased costs and a potential decrease in the quality of lumber and chips produced the
general consensus is that beetlekilled timber will remain merchantable for 5 to 15 years depending on local site conditions research
to gain more information about shelf life is one of the projects relative to the mountain pine beetle that canfor is supporting
     the provincial governments focus in the quesnel prince george morice and the lakes tsas among others has shifted to salvage
of beetlekilled timber rather than on suppression activities in 2004 the provincial chief forester revised the aac in the quesnel
prince george and the lakes tsas upward by approximately 4 million cubic metres to encourage salvage activities several new non
replaceable forest tenures have been and will be advertised for those areas inviting proposals for the use of this salvage volume
managing the potential safety issues associated with this increased harvesting activity continues to be a key focus for canfor eventually
projected by management to be 10 to 20 years from now the aac in the affected tsas will have to be reduced to counterbalance the
current increases in aac the extent of these future reductions is unknown at this time
     late in 2004 canfor in conjunction with the city of prince george and local ministry of forests  range representatives developed
recommendations for a salvage strategy for affected lodgepole pine trees on provincial crown land city land and private property within
the city limits the minister of forests acted on these recommendations by offering community forest tenure to the city of prince george
canfor is assisting the city with their efforts to apply for and manage this tenure


outlook
markets  in 2006 new home construction and repair and remodeling activity are expected to decline slightly from the record levels

in 2005 higher house prices rising interest rates and concerns over rising energy costs and inflation may result in a weakening in
housing demand and lower consumer spending however with the us economy expected to grow moderately in 2006 and the continuing
reconstruction of homes in the hurricaneaffected states activity in the housing sector is projected to remain relatively strong


operations  operating activities in 2006 are designed to enhance canfors operating performance and increase the alignment between

manufacturing and marketing strategies
     in 2006 the operating focus will be on the completion and start up of capital projects initiated in 2005 including those at the plateau
mackenzie houston and radium mills these capital projects were implemented to target canfors strategy of improving margins
reducing costs and aligning production activities with the overall marketing strategy additional capital projects will be initiated and
completed in 2006 with the aim of further capitalizing on this strategy
     in conjunction with these capital projects the group will continue to focus its attention in the following areas implementation of
quality control and optimization systems developed in 2005 a focus on supply chain initiatives including forecasting and order fulfillment
the execution of continuous improvement programs in all areas and the development of people and organizational strength

north american structural panel demand rose to record levels in 2005 reflecting the continued strength in new housing starts in
the second half of the year and the brisk activity before and after the hurricanes in the us gulf coast area similar to lumber supply
exceeded demand at various times throughout the year consequently panel prices decreased from last years high

operating performance
plywood  after a slow start in january due to the severely cold weather production milestones were set at the plywood operations in

the first quarter north central plywood had excellent performance into the second quarter increasing productivity and establishing
new daily production records a software upgrade on the scanner was completed in the second quarter and early results indicate that
this will have a very positive impact on plywood recovery
     the tackama operation had over 80 hours of downtime in the first quarter due to mechanical issues on the carousel and lathe the
mill also took a 9day maintenance shutdown in the third quarter in order to improve reliability and uptime measures
     aggregate plywood performance included a 7 gain in productivity along with a 4 improvement in plywood recovery but these
positive results were offset by an 11 increase in log costs which was primarily as a result of transfer pricing changes due to the
tackama sawmill closure


osb  with the exception of a 6 gain in product recovery 2005 was a disappointing year for osb performance production declined by

8 from 2004 driven almost entirely by a number of downtime occurrences the polarboard osb mill had some downtime in the first
quarter which arose due to lack of dry flake maintenance and reliability issues and power outages the mill was also shut down in the
last week of the first quarter for the installation of two new dryer drums and the completion of the planned capital project to increase
capacity the capital project continued into the second quarter after starting up the mill set several daily production records and is
continuing to work through the anticipated startup curve as noted above log recovery has improved by 6 as a result of process
improvements associated with the new equipment
     in the fourth quarter a major equipment failure occurred in the heat generation unit at the polarboard mill an 11day shutdown
was taken to repair the equipment and to complete other maintenance work that had been planned for early 2006 the shutdown resulted
in additional costs of 35 million and a production loss of 16 million square feet 38 basis these extra repairs and maintenance costs
along with a 22 million writedown of equipment replaced in the mills capacity upgrade project cost increases for resins and wax and
the overall lower production caused manufacturing costs at this mill to increase by 41 over 2004

canforlp osb limited partnership operating as peace valley osb
in 2000 slocan entered into a shareholders agreement with louisianapacific canada ltd to jointly undertake construction and
operation of an osb mill with rated annual capacity of 820 million square feet 38 basis in fort st john british columbia a limited
partnership was formed in 2004 to own the joint venture and carry on the business canfor has agreed to supply 330000 cubic metres of
timber annually to the joint venture out of its existing timber tenure in the area a key strategic advantage of the peace valley osb mill
is the ability to produce highvalue 9 and 10 panels for a growing market
     in 2005 canfor made contributions of 1023 million to the venture 1405 million to date for construction costs preproduction
expenses and working capital canfor has agreed to contribute 50 of the capital to fund the project which is estimated to have a total
funding requirement to both partners of approximately 2880 million of which 2580 million is capital related 170 million is for
deferred costs and the balance is for working capital the original budget for the construction was exceeded by approximately 410
million as a result of scope and design changes 110 million and unforeseen cost increases relating to adverse weather conditions and
raw materials and labour costs 300 million at the end of 2005 construction was substantially complete and the mill had commenced
limited production in december the mill currently estimates that it will be operating at 55 capacity by the end of the first quarter of
2006 and will ramp up to 90 capacity by the end of the year
     canfors 50 interest in the joint venturepartnership has been proportionately consolidated at december 31 2005 and an
operating loss of 08 million has been recognized in the year


outlook
markets  demand for both osb and canadian softwood plywood is expected to remain fairly strong in 2006 boosted by the largescale

rebuilding from the gulf coast hurricanes however supply increases in osb are expected to result in lower average osb prices in this
period


operations canfors plywood and osb facilities are focusing on producing more higherreturn and valueadded panels which will have

a positive impact on margins in the future with many of the capital and maintenance issues completed in 2005 the panel manufacturing
facilities are wellpositioned for significantly improved productivity and financial performance in the next year

     operating strategy


           to be a low cost producer of superior strength premium pulp




operating performance
total pulp and paper production for 2005 was 1316 million tonnes compared to 2004s production of 1276 million tonnes
     combined northern softwood kraft production averaged 3165 tonnes per day in 2005 compared to 3160 tonnes in 2004 northwood
and intercon set average daily production records in 2005 northwood struggled early in the year due to cold weather and other
operational issues averaging 1508 tonnes per day through april but with the completion of a maintenance outage in april and extensive
maintenance and capital upgrades to the recovery boilers northwood has averaged 1622 tonnes per day from may though december
production at prince george pulp was slowed back due to environmental constraints until the completion of the 1 recovery boiler
precipitator upgrade in december the mill averaged 706 tonnes per day compared to the previous years rate of 767 tonnes per day
     taylors production for 2005 was 205906 tonnes which set a new annual production record beating the 2004 record of 203893 tonnes
     the paper machine averaged 354 tonnes per day compared to 375 tonnes per day in 2004 the reduced production resulted from
mechanical and operational deficiencies particularly in the second quarter
     fibre costs averaged 81 per oven dried tonne odt in 2005 compared to 98 per odt in 2004 lower chip pricing was implemented
on july 1 2005 as a result of supplydemand dynamics in the interior of bc which was driven in part by the impact of incremental pine
beetle chips 2005 chip costs were 398 million less than 2004 123 million of this benefit was unrealized at the end of 2005 as the
savings resided in chip and pulp inventories for a net benefit of 275 million included in the 2005 results
     significant strides were made in cost reduction in 2005 with cash conversion costs for premium pulp ending the year 2 lower than
in 2004 maintenance costs continue to trend downward due to asset management initiatives and the realization of energy benefits from
the new cogeneration facility at the prince george pulp mill and the recovery boiler upgrade work at northwood
     the cogeneration project at the prince george pulp and paper mill was completed mid 2005 with the conversion of the 2 recovery
boiler to a power boiler and the commissioning of the turbo generator the prince george mill was slowed back in april running to
liquor availability with the limited firing capacity of the 1 recovery boiler until the new precipitator came online ahead of schedule on
december 15th the main benefits of the cogeneration facility are reduced electricity purchases reduced natural gas consumption
and increased productivity the benefit realized in 2005 from reduced purchased power was approximately 57 million going forward
savings are estimated to be 142 million annually at current electricity prices the 2005 benefit of reduced gas usage was approximately
16 million and is expected to be 57 million annually the precipitator project was completed in december 2005 and substantially
all of the benefits should be realized in 2006 as production ramps up and any operational issues are resolved on an annual basis the
combined benefits of the cogeneration and precipitator projects are estimated at 230 million
     annual maintenance shutdowns have been successfully extended to an 18month cycle for northwood and intercon and prince
george pulp will complete its first 18month cycle in early 2006
     asset management initiatives continue to have a positive impact on maintenance spending as reliabilitycentered maintenance
riskbased inspections defect elimination planning scheduling and optimization and business performance management initiatives
provide the tools and resources to positively impact costs total maintenance spending for 2005 was 918 million compared to 1025
million in 2003

markets
premium pulp  at the beginning of 2005 there were 31 days of supply in inventory in the chemical paper grade market pulp industry 6

after having completed 2004 with a shipmentstocapacity ratio of 107 in december the strong finish to 2004 was indicative of
restocking by buyers in asian markets stocks of bleached softwood market pulp canfors key grade stood at only 30 days of supply at
the beginning of 2005 which is the level at which producers are likely to have enough pricing power to raise prices through december
2005 inventories increased slightly to 32 days of supply which included 30 days of bleached softwood market pulp
       2005 started with northwest european pricing at us 630 per tonne and the industry was able to take advantage of a tightening of
supply in the first and second quarters of the year to allow pricing to climb into the us 650 range this pricing level was not sustainable
into the summer months which is traditionally a slow demand period in the industry prices dropped to the us 585 per tonne level
through the summer a slight resurgence in demand in the fall coupled with a rapidly strengthening canadian dollar allowed producers
to push prices back up to us 600 by the end of the year this pricing development through the year was similar to that of 2004
       overall demand for chemical paper grade market pulp through november 2005 was only 1 higher than the same period one
year earlier most of this gain was attributable to definitional changes in the shipments from some canadian pulp mills that changed
ownership at the end of 2004 most of the shipments from these mills were not considered market pulp in the past because they shipped
pulp to paper mills owned by the same parent company north american shipments were up by 8 through december mainly as a
result of this definitional change western european shipments were down by 26 japanese shipments were off by 41 and china
shipments were unchanged
       during 2005 canfor faced numerous external disruptions that impacted sales of market pulp a major challenge to operations was
poor and inconsistent delivery of empty railcars to canfors pulp mills particularly during the first and second quarters this caused
the mills to incur extra costs such as outside warehousing costs and also caused inventories to rise because sales had to be postponed
when product could not be shipped
       another disruption to the mill operations was the withdrawal of container truck services during the strike by the vancouver
container truckers association that began june 27th sales were delayed again and the mills had to carry extra inventory as a result of
this job action on some sales extra logistics costs had to be incurred in order to satisfy customer shipping requirements as a result
the strike added approximately us 09 million to canfors logistics costs during the third quarter
       in 2005 fuel surcharges implemented by rail and shipping carriers amounted to increases of approximately 12 these fuel
increases resulted in approximately us 18 million in incremental shipping costs




6 these inventory numbers are as reported by the pulp and paper products council for the world 19 group of producing countries this group is estimated to represent 85 of world chemical
    market pulp capacity

paper  during 2005 changes were made in the sales and marketing of the kraft paper produced in prince george a general

partnership was formed with tolko industries ltd to market and sell both companies kraft paper by combining the sales efforts of both
companies under the new partnership premium one papers customers needs are better served with a wider product selection and
security of supply



risks and uncertainties
the main business risks for the pulp and paper segment center upon pulp pricing exchange rates and energy prices
     to counter these risks canfor will continue to strive for a lowcost position on the global cost curve for both pulp and paper
successful implementation of the cogeneration project has positioned the prince george mill to reduce its conversion costs down
to the level of canfors other mills recovery boiler upgrade work completed in 2005 has enabled northwood to increase black liquor
solids throughput resulting in increased mill capacity and reduced energy costs an agreement with shell global solutions to implement
an asset management process saw continued success in 2005 reducing maintenance costs and increased reliability of production in
addition the period of time in between maintenance shutdowns has been lengthened to 18 months and successfully implemented at the
intercon and northwood mills with pg pulp to complete its first full cycle in 2006 to address the risk of major breakdowns associated
with the increase in the shutdown cycle and to meet regulatory requirements the mills perform minishuts within the 18month period
in order to seek to address any issues that may arise
     for paper the continued focus to counter these risks will also be on increasing sales of highervalue products and phasing out less
profitable grades customers and geographic regions


outlook
markets  looking forward to 2006 markets are expected to be stronger than in 2005 however a stronger canadian dollar could more

than offset any pricing gains
     consensus economics estimates real gdp growth of 3 globally in 2006 the same as 2005 the asia pacific region is expected
to expand at virtually the same rate as 2005 or about 37 there may be a slight weakening in gdp growth in north america but
forecasts indicate europe may accelerate its growth rate these conditions will provide paper markets with demand growth ranging from
flat in japan to a high of 31 in western europe chinese paper and board output will likely rise in the 89 range the shipments to
capacity ratio for market pulp is projected at 941 for all chemical paper grades increasing to 952 for softwood sulphate market
pulp historically this level of shipments implies that the industry is operating at full capacity
     the market is expected to be balanced through the first quarter as canadian pulp supply is becoming constrained due to mill
curtailments resulting from the stronger canadian dollar and rising costs particularly fibre costs in eastern canada the usual spring
maintenance programs at market pulp mills are expected to develop a stronger supplydemand balance into the second quarter
allowing for pricing improvement by the end of the second quarter strong pulp production and slowing summer demand will likely
lead to another inventory overhang which will precipitate falling prices into the second half of the year with seasonal demand in the fall
leading to a slight pickup in the latter part of the year industry consultants forecast that it is possible the industry will experience further
temporary or permanent mill closures of softwood market pulp capacity in 2006 as was the case in 2005 should this happen it could
have an impact on the supply and demand balance in favour of the remaining producers of softwood market pulp such as canfor


operations  all mills are forecasting record performance levels for 2006 with key drivers of improvement being the completion

of the precipitator project at prince george pulp and the realization of a full year of benefits from the 5 recovery boiler upgrade
at northwood
     costs are expected to decrease as a result of the lower chip prices implemented july 1 2005 the cogenerator operating at its full
rate in early 2006 and benefits from the mills asset management initiatives

discontinued operations


coastal operations  in the fourth quarter of 2005 canfor announced its intention to transfer its englewood logging operation and

associated timber licenses to a new limited partnership coastal fibre limited partnership cflp jointly owned with oji paper canada
ltd in consideration of the transfer canfor will receive a partnership interest with a fair value of 45 million which approximates book
value of the assets transferred cflp has agreed to transfer these assets to western forest products wfp in return for among other
things a longterm agreement with wfp to supply cflp with fibre and cflp has agreed to supply this fibre to howe sound limited
partnership the transfer which is subject to regulatory clearance under the federal competition act and by the british columbia
minister of forests is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of this transaction the former coastal operations
segment has been reclassified as discontinued operations
       in 2005 canfors coastal operations incurred a loss of 44 million after tax 2004  18 million loss including 25 million of
aftertax charges for severance lease termination costs and an allowance for bad debts log shipments totaled 8621 thousand cubic
metres in the year 2004  11483 thousand cubic metres weak market conditions persisted throughout the year as a result logging
operations were curtailed for most of the first quarter and throughout the third quarter canfors coastal logging operations were shut
down as of december 15th


sawmills  during the second quarter canfor completed the sale of its fort st james slocan and valemount sawmills in british

columbia for total cash proceeds of 590 million aftertax operating income of 33 million was earned by these operations in 2005
prior to the sale dates and a net aftertax loss of 47 million was recorded on the dispositions
       lumber shipments from discontinued operations in 2005 totaled 1205 million board feet 7 up to the date of disposition of the mills
in the second quarter in 2004 lumber shipments from these three mills totaled 4370 million board feet for the year


nonsegmented items


corporate and other
corporate and other costs of 367 million which are comprised of corporate head office and information technology costs decreased
by 173 million in 2005 compared to 2004 the 2004 expense was unusually high as a result of additional costs incurred from the
integration of the former slocan head office including severance costs of 92 million asset write downs and lease costs of 72 million
and duplicated corporate administration costs of 37 million


interest expense
interest expense was 422 million in 2005 net of interest income of 127 million compared to interest expense of 588 million net
of interest income of 83 million in 2004 longterm debt interest of 496 million decreased by 129 million in 2005 as a result of
principal reductions the impact of the stronger canadian dollar and the early redemption of the convertible debentures in november
2004 interest income increased by 44 million as a result of higher interest rates on temporary investments and interest charged to
howe sound limited partnership as discussed under related party transactions below other interest of 53 million was 07 million
higher than in 2004 as a result of increased credit facility standby and letter of credit fees


other income
other income of 128 million in 2005 was comprised of equity income from affiliates of 27 million 2004  113 million seaboard
general partnership income of 89 million 2004  nil and miscellaneous income of 12 million 2004  31 million expense
       canfors affiliated companies which are accounted for on an equity basis consist of lakeland mills ltd winton global lumber

british columbia the combined income of these affiliates decreased by 86 million from 2004 as a result of market and exchange
factors similar to those discussed in the lumber segment
     income of 89 million from the seaboard general partnership was recorded in 2005 as a result of asset sales canfor has a 199
interest in the partnership
     miscellaneous income of 12 million in 2005 includes 21 million in gains on the sale of property partially offset by losses on the
disposal of investments miscellaneous expenses of 31 million in 2004 were mainly comprised of a writedown of deferred costs for
the discontinued sawmill project in maine

unusual expense
in march 2003 the government of british columbia the crown introduced the forestry revitalization plan the plan that provided for
significant changes to crown forest policy and to the existing allocation of crown timber tenures to licensees the changes prescribed
in the plan included the elimination of minimum cut control regulations the elimination of existing timber processing regulations and
the elimination of restrictions limiting the transfer and subdivision of existing licenses as well through legislation licensees including
canfor were required to return 20 of their aac from replaceable tenures to the crown the plan states that approximately half of
this volume will be redistributed to create opportunities for woodlots community forests and first nations and the other half will be
available for public auction the crown acknowledged that licensees would be fairly compensated for the return of tenure and related
infrastructure costs such as roads and bridges
     the effect of the timber takeback resulted in a reduction of approximately 24 million cubic metres to canfors existing aac on
its replaceable tenures canfor worked with the government to identify those licenses and operating areas that were to be returned
to the crown and negotiations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 canfor received compensation of 570 million for the
loss of tenures and a 50 million advance payment against lost infrastructure and road construction costs a loss of 88 million 62
million after tax was recorded on the tenures in 2005 canfor is continuing discussions with the province for further compensation for
infrastructure but the amount and timing of additional compensation if any is not yet determinable
     canfor does not expect that the takeback will adversely affect its ability to obtain adequate timber supplies for its operations or
materially affect the costs of obtaining those supplies


income taxes
the income tax expense of 124 million recorded in 2005 2004  941 million is net of the benefit of utilizing 125 million of deferred
tax credits acquired from howe sound pulp and paper limited partnership hslp 2004  685 million in 2004 future income tax
savings of 11 million were realized arising from canfors share of hslps current operating losses 2005  nil the history behind
these losses is as follows
     on march 10 2001 canfor and oji paper co ltd oji of japan its 50 coventurer in the howe sound pulp and paper limited
howe sound joint venture transferred the business of howe sound into a limited partnership hslp hslp continues to be jointly
owned by canfor and oji and continues to carry on the operations of howe sound as a result of the reorganization howe sound was
amalgamated with canadian forest products ltd cfp canfors principal operating subsidiary and approximately 643 million of tax
losses of howe sound became available to reduce the future taxable income of cfp cfp has seven years in which to utilize these losses
as part of the reorganization cfp made a payment of 602 million to hslp in 2001 which was applied to reduce its longterm debt
during 2002 and 2004 cfp made additional payments to hslp of 50 million and 70 million respectively as a result of losses utilized
a final payment of 500 million was made to hslp on january 2 2005
     the other significant factor when comparing the 2005 and 2004 tax figures is the impact of a 15 reduction in the british columbia

other contractual obligations not included above are

       purchase obligations and contractual obligations in the normal course of business for example purchase obligations of a more
       substantial dollar amount generally relate to the pulp business and are subject to force majeure clauses in these instances
       actual volumes purchased may vary significantly from contracted amounts depending on canfors requirements in any given
       year in 2003 canfor entered into several longterm agreements with the purchaser of its former bc chemicals operation to
       ensure a continued supply of sodium chlorate and processing of the pulp mills soap skimmings into crude tall oil the minimum
       commitment under these agreements is for ten years at 290 million per year for chlorate and 45 million for soap skimming

       deferred reforestation for which a liability of 1110 million has been recorded at december 31 2005 2004 1112 million
       the reforestation liability is a fluctuating obligation based on the volume of timber harvested the future cash outflows are a
       function of the actual costs of silviculture programs and of harvesting at the time and are based on among other things the
       location of the harvesting

       capital expenditures as no significant contractual obligations had been entered into at december 31 2005

critical accounting estimates


the preparation of financial statements in conformity with canadian generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recorded in the financial statements management regularly reviews these
estimates and assumptions based on currently available information while it is reasonably possible that circumstances may arise which
cause actual results to differ from these estimates management does not believe it is likely that any such differences will materially
affect canfors financial position


employee future benefits  canfor has various defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing both pension and other

retirement benefits to most of its salaried employees and certain hourly employees not covered by forest industry union plans canfor
also provides certain health care benefits and pension bridging benefits to eligible retired employees the costs and related obligations
of the pension and other retirement benefit plans are accrued in accordance with the recommendations of the canadian institute of
chartered accountants cica
     canfor uses independent actuarial firms to perform actuarial valuations of the fair value of pension and other retirement benefit
plan obligations the application of these recommendations requires judgments regarding certain assumptions that affect the accrued
benefit provisions and related expenses including the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the obligation the expected
rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase and the assumed health care cost trend rates management and the
companys pension committee evaluate these assumptions annually based on their own experience and the recommendations of its
actuarial firms changes in these assumptions result in actuarial gains or losses which are amortized over the average remaining
service period of the active employee group covered by the plans only to the extent that the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses
are in excess of 10 of the greater of the accrued benefit obligation and the marketrelated value of plan assets


deferred reforestation  canfor accrues an estimate in current dollars of its future liability to perform forestry activities defined

to mean those silviculture treatments or activities that are carried out to ensure the establishment of a freegrowing stand of young
trees including logging road rehabilitation an estimate is recorded in the financial statements based on the number of hectares of
timber harvested in the period the actual costs that will be incurred in the future may vary based on among other things the actual
costs at the time


future income taxes  in accordance with cica recommendations canfor recognizes future income tax assets when it is more likely than

not that the future income tax assets will be realized this assumption is based on managements best estimate of future circumstances
and events if these estimates and assumptions are changed in the future the value of the future income tax assets could be reduced or
increased resulting in an income tax expense or recovery canfor reevaluates its future income tax assets on a regular basis


antidumping duty expense  as discussed in the lumber segment and below under risks and uncertainties canfor has expensed

antidumping duties at an estimated rate for certain periods while cash deposits are made at the deposit rate specified by the us
department of commerce doc the actual rate applicable to canfors product shipment profile will be assessed by the doc during
their administrative review process canfor regularly reviews its estimate of the effective rate by applying the docs calculation
methodology to updated sales and cost data the difference between the estimated rate and the cash deposit rate is recorded as a
longterm receivable on the balance sheet a comprehensive discussion of the softwood lumber duty situation follows in the risks and
uncertainties section

changes in accounting policies

effective january 1 2005

convertible debentures  effective january 1 2005 canfor retroactively adopted the new recommendations of the canadian institute

of chartered accountants cica concerning the balance sheet presentation of financial instruments as liabilities or equity canfor had
previously accounted for its convertible subordinated debentures as equity including the related interest charges in accordance with
eic71 financial instruments that may be settled at the issuers option in cash or its own equity instruments prior year figures have
been restated to reflect the debentures as liabilities and the related interest as an expense on the income statement this had no impact
on previously reported earnings per share or retained earnings the debentures had a maturity date of november 23 2006 but were
converted in november 2004 with the issuance of 11742424 common shares


variable interest entities  effective january 1 2005 canfor adopted the cicas new accounting guideline for the consolidation

of variable interest entities the primary objective of the guideline is to identify and report on entities over which control is achieved
through means other than voting rights the adoption of this guideline did not have a material impact on canfors financial position or
results of operations


cash and temporary investments  effective january 1 2005 canfor retroactively amended its presentation of cash and temporary

investments to include unpresented cheques which were previously included in accounts payable


vendor rebates  in september 2005 the cica issued a new abstract eic 156 accounting by a vendor for consideration given to

a customer including a reseller of the vendors products effective january 1 2006 the eic clarifies the measurement and
presentation of vendor discounts and volume rebates which canfor had previously presented under costs and expenses canfor has
elected to adopt the standard effective january 1 2005 which reduced both sales and costs and expenses by 1033 million for the year
2004  1050 million

effective january 1 2004

asset retirement obligations  effective january 1 2004 canfor retroactively adopted the new recommendations of the cica for asset

retirement obligations which require that such obligations be measured at fair value as a result of adopting these new recommendations
canfors deferred reforestation liability decreased by 56 million its net future income tax liability increased by 20 million and retained
earnings increased by 36 million at december 31 2003 the change in accounting for deferred reforestation liabilities resulted in a
02 million increase to the deferred reforestation expense in 2005 2004  22 million the new recommendations were not applied to
retirement obligations for assets with indeterminate useful lives because sufficient information is not presently available to estimate a
range of potential settlement dates for these obligations


impairment of longlived assets  the cica has issued new recommendations effective january 1 2004 related to the recognition

measurement and disclosure of impairment of longlived assets an asset is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value is not
recoverable and exceeds its fair value canfor regularly reviews its longlived assets for impairment and did not experience a material
impact upon initial adoption of these recommendations


shipping and handling costs  prior to january 1 2004 canfor along with other companies in the forest industry presented sales net

of shipping and handling costs effective january 1 2004 the cica introduced new recommendations for the application of generally
accepted accounting principles gaap which among other things prohibit the use of industry practice and provide guidance on
alternate sources to consult with when an issue is not specifically addressed by canadian gaap as a result of applying the new standard
effective january 1 2004 canfor reclassified shipping and handling costs and countervailing and antidumping duties to cost of sales
also in accordance with cica handbook section 3400 revenue shipping and handling costs recovered from customers have been
included in sales prior periods have been reclassified for comparability

risks and uncertainties


most companies in the forest industry in north america including canfor face similar business risks and uncertainties in addition to the
specific issues discussed above under each reporting segment risks and uncertainties fall into the general business areas of markets
international commodity prices competition currency exchange rates environmental issues forest land base government regulations
and policy reform and for canadian companies trade barriers and aboriginal land claims
     the future impact of the various uncertainties and potential risks described in the following paragraphs together with the risks
and uncertainties identified under each of the companys business segments listed above cannot be quantified or predicted however
canfor does not foresee unmanageable adverse effects on its business operations from and believes that it is well positioned to deal
with such matters as may arise


aboriginal issues
in 1997 the supreme court of canada in the delgamuukw decision confirmed the continued existence of aboriginal title and rights
to lands continuously used or occupied by aboriginal groups as a result aboriginal groups have claimed aboriginal title and rights
over substantial portions of british columbia including areas where canfors forest tenures are situated this decision has added to
uncertainty regarding property rights in canada including forest tenure and other resource rights particularly in much of british
columbia and other areas where treaties have not been concluded with aboriginal groups in 2005 the supreme court of canada made
an important decision relevant to the forest industry in the bernard and marshall case in this decision the supreme court held that
aboriginal title to forest resources had not been established as claimed by aboriginal groups in new brunswick and nova scotia the
supreme court held that although proof of aboriginal title must be sensitive to the aboriginal perspective it must nevertheless meet
common law standards of proof of title due to the complexity of aboriginal title issues it is not expected that the issues of aboriginal
title in british columbia will be finally resolved in the near to medium term
     in november 2004 the supreme court of canada in haida v british columbia and taku river v british columbia confirmed that
the duty to consult with aboriginal groups arises when the crown has knowledge real or constructive of the potential existence of an
aboriginal right or title and contemplates conduct that might adversely impact it notably the court found that the duty to consult is a
crown obligation that does not extend to third parties such as forestry companies while the crown can delegate procedural aspects
to third parties legal responsibility rests with the crown third parties cannot be held liable for the crowns failure to consult while the
crown is required to consult in good faith aboriginal consent is not required and aboriginal groups do not have a veto over government
decisions while this decision provides improved clarity regarding the duty to consult it may take some time for other related issues
regarding consultation and accommodation that were not addressed by the court to be resolved and for governments and aboriginal
groups to respond and adapt to the courts direction this may result in some continued uncertainty as further refinements of the duty
to consult and accommodate are clarified canfor will continue to cooperate communicate and exchange information and views with
aboriginal groups in order to foster good relationships and minimize risks to its tenures and operational plans


canadaus softwood lumber dispute
background  the canadaus softwood lumber agreement expired on march 31 2001 without being renewed or replaced on april 2

2001 countervailing duty cvd and antidumping duty add petitions covering certain softwood lumber products from canada were
filed with the us department of commerce doc and the us international trade commission itc by a us industry group
     on may 16 2002 the itc published its final determination on injury finding that canadian softwood lumber threatened material
injury to the us industry cvd deposits estimated at 1879 were required of virtually all importers and add cash deposits estimated
at 596 were required for imports by canfor however because the itc ruled that canadian lumber shipments only threatened
material injury and had not already caused material injury the obligation to make cvd and add deposits was made to be effective only
prospectively from may 22 2002 as a result in the second quarter of 2002 canfor reversed all preliminary cvd and add duties accrued
prior to may 22 2002




                   c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 0 5   50   m a n a g e m e n t  s d i s c u s s i o n a n d a n a ly s i s

countervailing duty case  from may 22 2002 to march 9 2004 canfor made cash deposits and expensed cvd at the required rate

of 1879 canfor filed for an expedited review of its cvd rate on march 31 2003 to obtain a companyspecific rate rather than make
deposits under the national rate of 1879 the doc completed this review process in february 2004 and the deposit rate was confirmed
at 1224 and became effective for shipments to the us after march 9 2004
     the doc determination that resulted in 1879 cvd was appealed to a nafta panel as a result of a series of nafta panel
rulings and remands to the doc on november 22 2005 the doc issued a fifth remand determination with a cvd rate of 080 which
is considered de minimis it is the position of the canadian parties that this finding requires the cvd order to be revoked and all cvd
deposits that have been collected so far and that have not been liquidated to be refunded with interest in canfors case none of its
cvd deposits have been liquidated it is the position of the doc that if the fifth remand determination is upheld it still will operate
prospectively only which means that the cvd order would be considered to have been effective for the period may 22 2002 through at
least november 22 2005 the fifth remand determination is currently under challenge by various parties before the nafta panel this
nafta cvd appeal will have no effect on cvd cash deposits or cvd until there is a final result in that appeal
     while the nafta litigation was proceeding the doc conducted annual administrative reviews of the cvd order the first annual
administrative review covered the period from may 22 2002 to march 31 2003 por1 on december 20 2004 the doc published its
final determination for the first review setting the cvd rate at 1718 this rate is to be used to determine the actual duties due for
entries made during por1 and the cvd cash deposit rate for shipments made on or after december 20 2004 was also changed to this
rate canfor has reduced the cvd expense accrual for por1 for the difference between the original deposit rate of 1879 and the rate
of 1718 published on december 20 2005 and expensed at the 1718 rate for shipments subsequent to december 20 2004 in
february 2005 as a result of ministerial errors in the calculation the doc announced a further reduction to this rate to 1637
applicable to assessment of cvd for por1 and to future cvd cash deposits as a result in the first quarter of 2005 canfor further
reduced its cvd accrual for por1 by 65 million to record cvd expense at 1637 the results in this review are under appeal and are
therefore not final
     the second annual administrative review covered the period from may 2003 to april 2004 por2 on december 12 2005 the doc
published its determination for the second review setting an assessment rate of 870 for por2 entries which is also applied as the
cash deposit rate on lumber entries occurring on or after december 12 2005 it is anticipated that the final determination in this review
will be appealed
     canfors subsidiary in quebec daaquam had a preliminary companyspecific cvd rate of 299 as a result of the zero rate review
process on october 18 2004 the doc announced that daaquam was not a zero rated company and would have the countrywide rate
applied to all us entries this doc decision is under appeal as part of the quebec border mill group action as a result of the doc
october 18 2004 decision and the december 14 2004 determination canfor has increased the cvd accrual to recognize the daaquam
cvd liability at the countrywide rate of 1637 for the period since canfors acquisition of daaquam in may 2003 and to 870 on or
after december 12 2005
     the doc third administrative review which is currently under way will determine the assessment of cvd duties for the period april
1 2004 to march 31 2005 as well as the future cash deposit rate preliminary review results are due may 31 2006 and final results are
due in the fall of 2006 but can be extended until as late as december 2006


antidumping case  in the case of the add cash deposits were made from may 22 2002 to december 21 2004 at the rate then required

596 canfor reviews its estimate of the add expense rate by applying the docs methodology to updated sales and cost data as they
become available the final rate will be determined when an official administrative review is complete for the respective periods the
first annual administrative review of the add order covered the period may 22 2002 to april 30 2003 and was completed in december
2004 this led to a change in the cash deposit rate on december 21 2004 from the original rate of 596 to 183 the latter rate is a
weighted average of canfor and slocan final rates from por1 based on a changed circumstances review conducted by the doc as
a result of the combination of the companies the canfor por1 rate was 259 and slocans por rate was 165 these individual
company assessment rates are to be applied to the entries for the period may 22 2002 to april 30 2003 in december 2004 canfor
reduced its expense accrual for por1 to reflect these announced final rates canfors results of the first administrative review are under
appeal and are therefore not final




                    c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 0 5   51   m a n a g e m e n t  s d i s c u s s i o n a n d a n a ly s i s

     the second annual administrative review of the add order covered the period may 1 2003 to april 30 2004 with final results
published on december 12 2005 the doc determined the add assessment rate for canfor at 136 for por2 which became the rate for
cash deposits on lumber shipments after december 12 2005 on january 23 2006 the doc revised the rate from 136 to 135 due to
ministerial errors this is the currently applicable cash deposit rate it is anticipated that canfors results in this review will be appealed
     in the add initial investigation and in the first and second add administrative reviews canfor was one of the companies selected
as a mandatory respondent and for this reason has received its own companyspecific add rate however in the third administrative
antidumping review which covers the period may 1 2004 to april 30 2005 por3 the doc employed a sampling methodology and
canfor was not selected as a mandatory respondent in the sampling process as a result the company may be assigned the all others
rate arising from the averaging of the rates of the mandatory respondents selected for por3 in the manner announced by the doc
there is no way of estimating what this rate may be canfor filed a voluntary questionnaire response in the third review but the doc
refused to accept canfor as a voluntary respondent which would have given canfor its own add rate for the third review canfor intends
to challenge the docs refusal vigorously as well as the sampling methodology that was used to select mandatory respondents for the
third review
     given the uncertainty around the likely final rates to be determined for the add with respect to por3 canfor has made no
adjustments to duties previously expensed for por2 to reflect the lower cvd and add rate as announced in december 2005 since
december 20 2004 canfor has expensed the duties at the same rate at which deposits are being paid which was 1637 for cvd and
183 for add until december 12 2005 and 870 and 136 respectively thereafter the add rate was subsequently amended by the
doc on january 23 2006 to 135


threat of injury determination  the nafta panel hearing the appeal of the itc finding that canadian imports threatened injury to

the us softwood lumber industry repeatedly found that the itc determination violated us law eventually the itc issued a remand
determination finding that the us softwood lumber industry was not threatened with material injury by reason of canadian imports
as expected the us challenged the nafta panels decision by recourse to a special extraordinary challenge committee ecc under
the nafta the ecc ruled against the us on august 10 2005 the position of the canadian parties is that the us antidumping and
countervailing duty orders must be terminated with effect as from may 22 2002 due to the itcs having found no threat of injury in its
nafta remand determination however the us position is that an itc determination that there was a threat of injury which was made
in a section 129 proceeding following the uss loss of its defense of the original itc determination before the wto effectively takes the
place of the itcs negative remand determination in nafta and supplies the legal underpinning for maintaining the cvd and add orders
in effect the matter is now being litigated before the us court of international trade cit and is expected to be decided by the cit in mid
2006 it is expected that the cits decision will be appealed to the next higher court the us court of appeals for the federal circuit
     the us coalition for fair lumber imports also has challenged the constitutionality of chapter 19 appeals process for antidumping
and countervailing duty proceedings in an effort to undermine all of the nafta panel decisions mentioned above it is unclear when the
court handling this challenge the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit will decide that case
     as at december 31 2005 canfor including slocan before april 12004 had paid combined duty deposits of us 7334 million add
of us 1735 million and cvd of us 5599 million since the inception of cvd and add in may 2002 all of these deposits would be eligible
for refund to canfor with interest if the litigation concerning the effect of the itc negative remand determination were successful
     the doc officially announced in the federal register that it would be assessing duties in accordance with the rates that it
determined in the first and second add and cvd reviews which legal counsel advise would result in the excess cvd and add deposits
being recoverable with interest if the entirety of such deposits were not recoverable on account of failure of the cit litigation
concerning the itcs negative remand determination for a given period of review por assessment of duties and refund of excess
deposits will not occur until all subsequent challenges or appeals for that particular por are finalized
     the company and other canadian forest product companies the canadian federal government and canadian provincial
governments canadian interests categorically deny the us allegations and strongly disagree with the final countervailing and dumping
determinations made by the doc in the investigations and reviews and with the itcs determination in the section 129 proceeding
canadian interests continue to aggressively defend the canadian industry in this us trade dispute canadian interests may appeal the
decision of these administrative agencies to the appropriate courts nafta panels and the wto

environmental certification
customers of forest products increasingly require assurances that products purchased are derived from wellmanaged forests canfor
has responded by implementing a comprehensive thirdparty sustainable forest management sfm certification strategy to verify that
its forest operations are well managed
     canfor retains an international organization for standardization iso 14001 certification of its environmental management
system for its forest operations first obtained in 1999 and recertified as required for subsequent 3year terms in addition canfor
maintains certification under the canadian standards association csa standard for sustainable forest management cancsa z809
for its forest management agreement area at grande prairie alberta for its tree farm licences at chetwynd englewood prince
george and vavenby british columbia for its forest licences at fort st john houston prince george fort nelson vanderhoof vavenby
and quesnel british columbia and for its pulpwood agreements at fort st john and fort nelson british columbia
     canfor is committed to having sustainable forest management certification in place for all of its tenures


environmental issues
the species at risk act sara was proclaimed by the government of canada in june 2003 the purpose of the act is to prevent the
extinction or extirpation of wildlife species present in canada for at least 50 years to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are
extirpated endangered or threatened as a result of human activity and encourage the management of other species to prevent them
from becoming at risk the economic implications of sara are potential reductions in timber harvests and increases in harvesting costs
none of which can be predicted at this time
     in december 2002 the government of canada ratified the kyoto agreement the climate change plan for canada which sets
out canadas kyoto implementation strategy indicates that federal and provincial energy and environment ministers have endorsed
the principle that companies that take early action should not be disadvantaged by an output based emissions regime canfor was an
early signatory to the climate change voluntary challenge and registry program a federal program introduced in 1997 to encourage
companies to inventory and track their greenhouse gas emissions ghgs and take actions to stabilize and reduce those emissions canfor
has implemented projects that have improved energy efficiency and displaced purchased fossil fuel energy with renewable biomass
energy thereby reducing ghg emissions both on absolute and per unit of production bases canfor has opportunities to further reduce
ghg emissions particularly through increased utilization of sawmill wood residuals in november 2003 the forest products association
of canada fpac on behalf of canfor and other forest products companies signed a memorandum of understanding respecting action
on climate change mou with the federal government the mou establishes a framework for upcoming negotiations of a pulp and
paper sector covenant with the federal government the mou specifies that the government of canada will work with fpac parties
and other industries to design a system that will not disadvantage those firms that have taken early action to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions the covenant will establish a ghg emissions reduction requirement equivalent to on average a reduction of 12 over 2008
to 2012 the first kyoto commitment period relative to business as usual ghg emission projections canfor believes that its pulp and
paper mills are wellpositioned to comply with the likely covenant requirements
     canadawide standards have been established by the government of canada for respirable particulate pm 25 and ozone levels in
the ambient air which will become effective in 2010 the pm 25 standard could require future source reductions of particulate emissions
from canfors pulp paper and sawmill facilities the cost of which cannot yet be determined
     canfor has two remaining tier 1 burners in british columbia and is one of three companies utilizing a third burner located at
another companys premises also in british columbia tier 1 burners are regulated by the ministry of environment for phase out by
december 31 2007 canfor is diligently seeking economically viable solutions for its wood waste and remaining tier 1 burners including
woodfuelled sawmill energy systems manufacture of wood pellets and simultaneous electricity and heat cogeneration

financial market risk
demand for forest products both pulp and paper and wood products is closely related to global business conditions and tends to be
cyclical in nature product prices can be subject to volatile change canfor like the majority of the canadian forest products industry
competes in a global market and the majority of its products are sold in us dollars consequently foreign currency relationships pose
a significant uncertainty shifts in these relationships can have a major impact positive or negative on profits from operations the
strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar in the last three years has had a negative impact on sales and profits
from operations however by maintaining a substantial proportion of its debt in us dollars canfor has partially mitigated the impact of
currency fluctuations

december 31 2005

1 significant accounting policies


basis of presentation of financial statements
these financial statements include the accounts of canfor corporation the company and its subsidiary companies hereinafter referred
to as canfor investments over which the company exercises significant influence are accounted for using the equity method in which
the original investment is recorded at cost and is subsequently adjusted for the companys share of post acquisition earnings joint
ventures are proportionately consolidated


use of estimates
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with canadian generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes it is reasonably
possible that circumstances may arise which cause actual results to differ from management estimates however management does
not believe it is likely that such differences will materially affect canfors financial position
      significant areas requiring the use of management estimates are deferred reforestation costs inventory valuations amortization
rates accrued antidumping and countervailing duties and pension and other benefit plan assumptions


temporary investments
temporary investments comprise bankers acceptances commercial paper and other shortterm instruments with maturities of three
months or less and are valued at cost which approximates fair value


valuation of inventories
inventories of lumber panels pulp and kraft paper are valued at the lower of average cost and net realizable value logs and chips are
valued at average cost or the greater of net realizable value and replacement cost if lower than average cost processing materials and
supplies are valued at the lower of average cost and replacement cost


property plant equipment and timber
canfor capitalizes the costs of major replacements extensions and improvements to plant and equipment together with related interest
incurred during the construction period on major projects


assets are amortized over the following estimated productive lives

amortization of logging and manufacturing assets is calculated on a unit of production basis amortization of plant and equipment not
employed in logging and manufacturing is calculated on a straightline basis logging roads are amortized on a basis related to the
volume of timber harvested for those tree farm licenses and timber licenses which are renewable with the province of british columbia
amounts capitalized as timber are amortized over the estimated tree growth cycle as volume is harvested nonrenewable licenses are
amortized over the period of the license

deferred charges
software development costs relating to major systems are deferred and amortized over periods not longer than five years startup costs
for the newly constructed oriented strand board mill are being amortized over a period of three years


deferred reforestation
canfor accrues the undiscounted cost of the reforestation required under its timber harvest agreements at the time that the timber is
harvested the liability is remeasured at fair value at the end of the fiscal period as discussed in note 2


employee benefit plans
canfor has various defined benefit and defined contribution plans that provide both pension and other retirement benefits to most of its
salaried employees and certain hourly employees not covered by forest industry union plans canfor also provides certain health care
benefits and pension bridging benefits to eligible retired employees
     canfor accrues the costs and related obligations of the defined benefit pension and other retirement benefit plans using the
projected benefit actuarial method prorated on service and managements best estimates of expected plan investment performance
salary escalation and other relevant factors for the purpose of calculating the expected return on plan assets those assets are valued
at fair value actuarial gains losses arise from the difference between the actual and expected longterm rates of return on plan
assets for a period or from changes in actuarial assumptions used to determine the accrued benefit obligation the excess of the net
accumulated actuarial gain or loss over 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets is amortized over
the average remaining service period of the active employees which is 15 years for both pension and other benefit plans past service
costs arising from plan amendments are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of
employees active at the date of the amendment on january 1 2000 canfor adopted the new recommendations of the canadian institute
of chartered accountants relating to the accounting for pensions and other post employment benefits using the prospective application
method canfor is amortizing the transitional obligation on a straightline basis over 15 years which was the average remaining service
period of employees expected to receive benefits under the benefit plan as of january 1 2000
     pension expense for the defined contribution plans is based on a percentage of employees salaries or on a contribution required
under collective agreements
     for hourly employees covered by forest industry union defined benefit pension plans earnings are charged with canfors
contributions required under the collective agreements


revenue recognition
canfors revenues are derived from the following major product lines lumber pulp kraft paper panel products and raw logs revenue
is recognized from product sales when persuasive evidence of a sale exists the sales price is fixed and determinable goods have been
delivered and collectibility is reasonably assured sales are reported net of discounts and allowances amounts charged to customers
for shipping and handling are recognized as revenue and shipping and handling costs incurred by the company are reported as cost of
sales lumber duties are recorded as a component of costs of sales


foreign currency translation
the majority of canfors sales and longterm debt are denominated in foreign currencies foreign currencies are translated into
canadian dollars using the temporal method as follows monetary assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates nonmonetary
assets and liabilities at historical rates and revenues and expenses at exchange rates prevailing at the time the transaction occurs
exchange gains and losses are reflected in income immediately however prior to january 1 2003 canfor hedged its us dollar long
term debt with its us dollar revenue streams exchange losses deferred prior to canfors termination of this hedging relationship are
recognized into income in the same periods as the corresponding debt repayments
     canfors foreign operations are considered to be selfsustaining and the assets and liabilities are translated using the current rate
method the translation gain or loss is included as a component of shareholders equity




                  c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 0 5   61   n o t e s t o t h e c o n s o l i d at e d f i n a n c i a l s tat e m e n t s

income taxes
canfor accounts for income taxes using the liability method under this method future income tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on the temporary differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities these temporary differences
are measured using the current tax rates and laws expected to apply when these differences reverse future tax benefits such as capital
loss carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is considered more likely than not the effect on future
tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the substantive enactment date of
the change occurs


derivative financial instruments
canfor utilizes derivative financial instruments in the normal course of its operations as a means to manage its foreign exchange and
commodity price risk for example from time to time canfor purchases foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge anticipated sales
to customers in the united states and the related accounts receivable and also enters into swap transactions to reduce its exposure to
fluctuating natural gas prices canfors policy is not to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
     canfor formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions this process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and
liabilities or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions canfor also formally assesses both at the inception of the hedge
and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values
or cash flows of hedged items
     gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts used to hedge us dollar denominated sales are recognized as an
adjustment to revenue at the time that the contract is exercised gains and losses on natural gas swaps are recognized as an adjustment
to manufacturing costs when the contracts are settled


impairment of longlived assets
longlived assets are reviewed for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparison of their net book value to the estimated future cash flows
generated by their use impaired assets are recorded at fair value determined principally using discounted future cash flows expected
from their use and eventual disposition


stockbased compensation plans
canfor has three stockbased compensation plans as described in note 14
     when stock options are granted to employees under the stock option performance plan compensation expense is recorded
based on a fair value method of accounting the fair value of the options is determined using an option pricing model that takes into
account as of the grant date the exercise price the expected life of the option the current price of the underlying stock and its expected
volatility expected dividends on the stock and the riskfree interest rate over the expected life of the option the resulting fair value
of the options is amortized over their vesting periods cash consideration received from employees when they exercise the options is
credited to share capital
     compensation expense is recognized for canfors contributions to the employee share purchase plan when they are made
     compensation expense is recognized for canfors deferred share unit plan when the deferred share units are granted and
changes in market value of the underlying shares are reflected in earnings at the end of each period

2 change in accounting policies


vendor rebates
in september 2005 the cica issued a new abstract eic 156 accounting by a vendor for consideration given to a customer including a
reseller of the vendors products effective january 1 2006 the eic clarifies the measurement and presentation of vendor discounts
and volume rebates which canfor had previously presented under costs and expenses canfor elected to adopt the abstract effective
january 1 2005 which reduced both sales and costs and expenses by 1033 million for the year 2004  1050 million


convertible debentures
effective january 1 2005 canfor retroactively adopted the new recommendations of the canadian institute of chartered accountants
cica concerning the balance sheet presentation of financial instruments as liabilities or equity canfor had previously accounted for its
convertible subordinated debentures as equity including the related interest charges in accordance with eic71 financial instruments
that may be settled at the issuers option in cash or its own equity instruments prior year figures have been restated to reflect the
debentures as liabilities and the related interest as an expense on the income statement this had no impact on previously reported
earnings per share or retained earnings the debentures had a maturity date of november 23 2006 but were converted in november
2004 with the issuance of 11742424 common shares


variable interest entities
effective january 1 2005 canfor adopted the cicas new accounting guideline for the consolidation of variable interest entities the
primary objective of the guideline is to identify and report on entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting
rights the adoption of this guideline did not have a material impact on canfors financial position or results of operations


cash and temporary investments
effective january 1 2005 canfor retroactively amended its presentation of cash and temporary investments to include unpresented
cheques which were previously included in accounts payable


asset retirement obligations
effective january 1 2004 canfor retroactively adopted the new recommendations of the canadian institute of chartered accountants
cica for asset retirement obligations which require that such obligations be measured at fair value the change in accounting for
deferred reforestation resulted in a 02 million increase to the deferred reforestation expense in 2005 2004  22 million the new
recommendations were not applied to retirement obligations for assets with indeterminate useful lives because sufficient information
is not presently available to estimate a range of potential settlement dates for the obligations


shipping and handling costs
prior to january 1 2004 canfor along with other companies in the forest industry presented sales net of shipping and handling costs
effective january 1 2004 the cica introduced new recommendations for the application of generally accepted accounting principles
gaap which among other things prohibit the use of industry practice and provide guidance on alternate sources to consult with
when an issue is not specifically addressed by canadian gaap as a result of applying the new standard effective january 1 2004 canfor
has reclassified shipping and handling costs and countervailing and antidumping duties to cost of sales also in accordance with cica
handbook section 3400 revenue shipping and handling costs recovered from customers have been included in sales prior periods
have been reclassified for comparability

16 countervailing and antidumping duties


the us department of commerce doc determination that resulted in countervailing duty cvd of 1879 was appealed to a nafta
panel as a result of a series of nafta panel rulings and remands to the doc on november 22 2005 the doc issued a fifth remand
determination with a cvd rate of 080 which is considered de minimis it is the position of the canadian parties that this finding
requires the cvd order to be revoked and all cvd deposits that have been collected so far and that have not been liquidated to be
refunded with interest in canfors case none of its cvd deposits have been liquidated it is the position of the doc that if the fifth
remand determination is upheld it will operate prospectively only which means that the cvd order would be considered to have been
effective for the period may 22 2002 through at least november 22 2005 the fifth remand determination is currently under challenge
by various parties before the nafta panel this nafta cvd appeal will have no effect on cvd cash deposits or cvd until there is a final
result in that appeal
           while the nafta litigation was proceeding the doc conducted annual administrative reviews of the cvd order on december
20 2004 the doc published its final determination for the first annual administrative review covering the period from may 22 2002 to
march 31 2003 por1 setting the cvd rate at 1718 this rate is to be used to determine the actual duties due for entries made during
por1 and the cvd cash deposit rate for shipments made on or after december 20 2004 at that time canfor reduced the cvd expense
accrual for por1 for the difference between the original deposit rate of 1879 and the revised rate of 1718 and began expensing at
the 1718 rate for shipments subsequent to december 20 2004 in february 2005 as a result of ministerial errors in the calculation the
doc announced a further reduction to this rate to 1637 applicable to assessment of cvd for por1 and to future cvd cash deposits as
a result in the first quarter of 2005 canfor further reduced its cvd accrual for por1 by 65 million to record cvd expense at 1637
the results in this review are on appeal and are therefore not final on december 12 2005 the doc published its determination for the
second administrative review covering the period from may 2003 to april 2004 por2 the doc set an assessment rate of 870 for
por2 entries and as the cash deposit rate on lumber entries occurring on or after december 12 2005 it is anticipated that the final
determination in this review will be appealed the docs third administrative review which is currently underway will determine the
assessment of cvd duties for the period from april 1 2004 to march 31 2005 as well as the future cash deposit rate preliminary review
results are due may 31 2006 and final results are due in the fall of 2006 but can be extended until as late as december 2006




                                      c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 0 5   74   n o t e s t o t h e c o n s o l i d at e d f i n a n c i a l s tat e m e n t s

     in the case of the antidumping duty add from may 22 2002 to december 21 2004 cash deposits were made at 596 which
was the rate required at that time canfor recorded the add expense for that period at a lower rate which was estimated by applying
the docs methodology to updated sales and cost data as they become available the final rate will be determined when an official
administrative review is complete for the respective periods the docs first annual administrative review of the add order covering
the period from may 22 2002 to april 30 2003 por1 was completed in december 2004 this led to a change in the cash deposit rate
on december 21 2004 from the original rate of 596 to a weighted average rate for canfor and slocan of 183 in december 2004
canfor reduced its expense accrual for por1 to reflect these announced final rates canfors results of the first administrative review
are on appeal and are therefore not final the second annual administrative review of the add order covered the period may 1 2003 to
april 30 2004 por2 and final results were published on december 12 2005 the doc determined the add assessment rate for canfor
at 136 subsequently amended by the doc on january 23 2006 to 135 for por2 and for cash deposits on lumber shipments after
december 12 2005 it is anticipated that canfors results in this review will be appealed
     in the initial add investigation and in the first and second add administrative reviews canfor was one of the companies selected
as a mandatory respondent and for this reason has received its own companyspecific add rate however in the third administrative
antidumping review which covers the period from may 1 2004 to april 30 2005 por3 the doc employed a sampling methodology
and canfor was not selected as a mandatory respondent in the sampling process as a result canfor may be assigned the all others
rate arising from the averaging of the rates of the mandatory respondents selected for por3 in the manner announced by the doc
there is no way of estimating what this rate may be canfor filed a voluntary questionnaire response in the third review but the doc
refused to accept canfor as a voluntary respondent which would have given canfor its own add rate for the third review canfor intends
to challenge the docs refusal vigorously as well as the sampling methodology that was used to select mandatory respondents for the
third review given the uncertainty around the likely final rates to be determined for the add with respect to por3 canfor has made no
adjustments to duties previously expensed for por2 to reflect the lower cvd and add rate as announced in december 2005
     since december 20 2004 canfor has expensed the duties at the same rate at which deposits are being paid which was
1637 for cvd and 183 for add until december 12 2005 and 870 and 136 subsequently amended by the doc to 135 on
january 21 2006 respectively thereafter the cumulative additional cvd accrued in excess of the cash deposits made at december 31
2005 is 674 million and is included in other accruals and provisions note 11 the cumulative add cash deposits in excess of the
calculated expense accrued at december 31 2005 is 1137 million and is being carried as a receivable under longterm investments
and other note 5
     the nafta panel hearing the appeal of the us international trade commission itc finding that canadian imports threatened
injury to the us softwood lumber industry repeatedly found that the itc determination violated us law eventually the itc issued a
remand determination finding that the us softwood lumber industry was not threatened with material injury by reason of canadian
imports as expected the us challenged the nafta panels decision by recourse to a special extraordinary challenge committee ecc
under the nafta the ecc ruled against the us on august 10 2005 the position of the canadian parties is that the us antidumping
and countervailing duty orders must be terminated with effect as from may 22 2002 due to the itcs having found no threat of injury
in its nafta remand determination however the us position is that an itc determination that there was a threat of injury which was
made in a section 129 proceeding following the uss loss of its defense of the original itc determination before the wto effectively
takes the place of the itcs negative remand determination in nafta and supplies the legal underpinning for maintaining the cvd and
add orders in effect the matter is now being litigated before the us court of international trade cit and is expected to be decided
by the cit in mid2006
     the us coalition for fair lumber imports also has challenged chapter 19 appeals process for antidumping and countervailing
duty proceedings in an effort to undermine all of the nafta panel decisions mentioned above it is unclear when the court handling this
challenge the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit will decide that case
     as at december 31 2005 canfor including slocan before april 12004 had paid combined duty deposits of us 7334 million add
of 1735 million and cvd of 5599 million since the inception of cvd and add in may 2002 all of these deposits would be eligible for
refund to canfor with interest if the litigation concerning the effect of the itc negative remand determination were successful
     the company and other canadian forest product companies the canadian federal government and canadian provincial
governments canadian interests categorically deny the us allegations and strongly disagree with the final countervailing and dumping

20 unusual expense


the forestry revitalization plan
in march 2003 the government of british columbia the crown introduced the forestry revitalization plan the plan that provides for
significant changes to crown forest policy and to the existing allocation of crown timber tenures to licensees the changes prescribed
in the plan include the elimination of minimum cut control regulations the elimination of existing timber processing regulations and
the elimination of restrictions limiting the transfer and subdivision of existing licenses through legislation licensees are required to
return 20 of their replaceable tenure to the crown the plan states that approximately half of this volume will be redistributed to open
up opportunities for woodlots community forests and first nations and the other half will be available for public auction licensees will
be compensated by the crown for the return of tenure and related infrastructure costs such as roads and bridges
       the effect of the timber takeback resulted in a reduction of approximately 24 million cubic metres to canfors existing allowable
annual cut on its replaceable tenures
       on october 28 2005 canfor signed an agreement with the province of british columbia in which canfor received 570 million in
compensation for the loss of tenures noted above and a 50 million advance payment against lost infrastructure and road construction
costs a loss of 88 million was recorded on the tenures taken back canfor is continuing discussions with the province for further
compensation for infrastructure but the amount and timing of additional compensation if any is not yet determinable
