                  climate risk is a vital management issue for insurance companies at the same time efforts to address this
                  issue may lead to new business opportunities
                     the sompo japan group is working to develop insurance products and financial services that serve as
                  effective measures to adapt to climate change for example we have been developing methods to
                  assess flood risk in japan that take into account the impacts of climate change and the provision of new
                  risk finance in developing countries in asia in the realm of mitigation sompo japan is working together
                  with the agencies that are an important part of our value chain to accelerate specific medium and long
                  term measures including the reduction of co2 emissions and paper use we are also working in
                  partnership with customers to reduce paper use by implementing online contract procedures promoting
                  safe and ecologically responsible driving and promoting the use of recycled parts for repairs to vehicles
                  damaged in accidents
                     as a member of an international initiative comprised of industries and institutional investors from all
                  over the world we also make efforts to encourage other companies to take action on climate change

        toward becoming a carbon neutral corporate group
         for all business activities on a consolidated basis including overseas subsidiaries


            becoming a carbon neutral company means reducing our co2 emissions to zero by first becoming aware of the co2 we
        emit through our business activities and then voluntarily working to reduce emissions by purchasing emission permits
        carbon offsets and entering into other schemes to compensate for the emissions we have difficulty reducing see the figure
        at the bottom of p 68 money used to purchase carbon offsets are invested in co2 reduction projects in japan and
        developing economies
            while emissions in the nipponkoa insurance group are by no means large compared to manufacturing and other
        industries we announced our commitment to becoming a carbon neutral company in july 2008 with an aim to reduce our
        greenhouse gas emissions and promote carbon neutrality among our stakeholders with the end goal of fulfilling our mission
        to sustainably provide insurance this commitment aims to achieve carbon neutrality zero net co2 emissions by fy2012

  visualizing co2 emissions throughout the value chain
  developing our own standards for
  measuring co2 emissions

   with no established standards for calculating co2 emissions in all our business activitiesincluding upstream and
downstream business activitiesnipponkoa working together with japans ministry of the environment moe and
environmental experts formulated the nipponkoa standards for calculating co2 emissions and is now using the
standards to calculate co2 emissions across its value chain




                policy for formulating the nipponkoa standards for calculating co2 emissions

         these calculation standards were formulated in accordance with the moes guidelines on methods for calculating
          greenhouse gas ghg emissions from activities subject to carbon reduction and offsets

         emission factors are adopted from values published in the order for enforcement of the act on promotion of global
          warming countermeasures and the carbon dioxide emissions per unit of transportation volume published by
          japans ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism

         for activities without standard emission factors and calculation methods unique calculation methods and standards
          were set using values published by trade groups and various statistical data

         the standards were formulated with the aim to help improve the global environment through fewer co2 emissions
          by allowing us to calculate and monitor emissions arising from our own activities and are not intended for
          performing exhaustive calculations of emissions from all other activities therefore a preference was made for
          establishing practical and broadly applicable calculation methods for activities that are difficult to calculate precisely

co2  cost monitoring service launched through collaboration with
companies specializing in various fields
   in an aim to provide comprehensive solution services for solving societys challenges and thus help build a safe secure
and sustainable society nipponkoa launched a co2  cost monitoring service in august 2010 through collaboration with
nksjrm hitachi solutions ltd and recycle one inc

a onestop service for all environmental contribution co2 reduction support
   this service has two main components a co2  cost monitoring system which allows our customers to easily calculate the
co2 emitted by their business activities while also managing costs and a consulting service to help them set co2 reduction
targets and policies and reduce their emissions we intend to make this a onestop service for businesses looking to reduce their
carbon emissions
   the co2  cost monitoring system is based on the nipponkoa standards for calculating co2 emissions and was jointly
developed by nipponkoa and hitachi solutions



                                           managing co2 emissions and costs simultaneously with the same tool allows for
                                           simultaneous reduction of co2 emissions and costs
  cost reduction support
                                           approaches cost cutting from the perspective of reducing co2 emissions thereby
                                           boosting employee motivation

   the co2  cost monitoring system is a service that encourages businesses to step up their efforts to reduce global warming
by enabling them to simultaneously manage costs and calculate not only co2 emitted directly from using electricity and other

        receive from naturewhich is to say without biological
        diversity yet species are going extinct at a rate never before
        seen as a result of human and development activities and we
        are in the midst of a biodiversity crisis once species
        disappear and ecosystems are destroyed we run the risk that
        they will never be fully restored
           one function of the ecosystem services supported by
        biodiversity is climatecharge mitigation and moderation

        moderate the effects of climate change declines increasing
        the chances that natural disasters such as mudslides and
        floods inflict greater damage this would also have a serious                        assessing and addressing the risks of our

         of performance         dropped by 1360 tons of co2 199 as a result of reduction efforts taken together these factors led to a total emissions

             supplementary information on greenhouse gas emissions reporting

             nipponkoa performs greenhouse gas ghg inventory calculations with the intention of measuring and monitoring the co2 emissions
              resulting from its activities based on the underlying goal to become carbon neutral and improve the global environment by reducing its co2
              emissions
             while we take the greatest care to generate accurate and valid data we prefer establishing practical and broadly applicable calculation
              methods for activities that are difficult to calculate precisely
             when activity data eg volume of materialsenergy used and their emission factors were not sufficiently precise and there was a possibility
              that calculated emissions would be less than actual emissions we used a more conservative emission factor so that calculated emissions
              would never be less than actual emissions
             the organizational boundaries of these calculations encompass nipponkoa and the subsidiaries including those overseas included in its
              consolidated financial statements
             the operational boundaries of these calculations are those noted on p 67 however scope 3 indirect emissions resulting from business
              activities excluding use of fossil fuels and purchased electricity activities are calculated only for nipponkoa
             ghg emissions purchased as carbon offsets see p 70 were not subtracted from the emissions data shown on this page this also applies to
              carbon sequestered by nipponkoa forests see p 74
             when we expanded the organizational boundaries of calculations to include consolidated subsidiaries we added thermal energy steam hot
              water cold water to the calculations and also fixed a calculation error for class a heavy oil we therefore went back and changed the
              performance figures for past years
             for calculating use of fossil fuels until fy2008 we estimated use based on costs but since fy2009 we have used actual measured values we
              make continual efforts to use actual measurements of activities where we previously used estimated and other nonmeasured values
             some but not all data have been validated by a validating institution sgs japan performance data in fy2012 the year we plan to become
              carbon neutral will undergo complete validation by a validating institution
             ghg emissions calculation results are reported to and approved by our internal environment committee chaired by the company president
              the environment committee appropriately manages yearly ghg data
             reporting periods and activities not provided above are described in the csr report
             the csr department general manager is responsible for ghg emissions reporting
             we conduct ghg emissions reporting while referring to iso 140641 specification with guidance at the organizational level for quantification
              and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals
