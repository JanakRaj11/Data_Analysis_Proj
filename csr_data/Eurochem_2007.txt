     development of the production base  a contribution to the sustainable
     development of the company and the country  commentary of a tugolukova technical
     director of eurochem mcc

                                  for the last 5 years we achieved record production figures which enabled eurochem mcc not only to declare
                                  itself as a serious player but also to enter the circle of industry leaders of course it is difficult to support such
                                  growth without new inventions and new productive capacities optimization has taken place at practically all
                                  existing sites for example nak azot now has a competitive fully renovated productive capacity which has
                                  already shown results the development strategy adopted in 2006 gives us a clear vision of the outlook this
                                  is very important for production where it is impossible to make decisions based upon momentary requests
                                  besides the phosphate and nitrogen areas which are traditionally important for us in the upcoming years we
                                  expect growth in the development of potassium fertilizers in connection with the launch of a megaproject the
                                  gremyachinsky field

     the company does not set its goal to be among the five world leaders of potassium for us the project of developing the gremyachinsky
     field allows for solving another task  to become a company able to offer the consumer a full set of services we now produce a sufficient
     quantity of nitrogen and phosphate when we add potassium to this our company will become the fourth company in the world that can
     offer the entire set of services we have great plans for development i think that the analysts are absolutely right that it is the domestic
     market that will allow us to maintain and multiply the trend that we have had for all these 5 years and this will be our contribution to the
     sustainable growth of the country as a whole

                                                                                                          eurochem  corporate social report  2006      25

in 2006 the board of directors of eurochem mcc approved                         2006 became a breakthrough year for the phosphate area of the
the midterm strategy for developing the companys phosphate                    production activity of eurochem mcc the results of the year
business two goals have been set for the company occupying                    show that the company successfully handled the problems of
leading positions on the european ammophos and diammonium                       the phosphate component of its business just 2 years ago the
phosphate markets as well as strengthening its position in russia              enterprises pg phosphorit and eurochembmu were loss
and neighboring countries in order to reach these goals significant           making in 2006 lifosa phosphorit and eurochembmu showed
changes were undertaken in the companys corresponding                          significant growth in the level of profitability now the phosphate
production groups these changes were connected both with the                   area of production of eurochem mcc plays a significant role in
modernization of the technological base and with withdrawing                    the sustainable growth of the holding company
capacities with a poor outlook from production




    the diammonium phosphate produced by the lithuanian enterprise lifosa ab now sets the quality standard for this product in europe
    in order to perfect the technology of this product the technological ventilation was replaced and the vacuum equipment was updated
    a project for the supplemental usage of sulfuric acid heat is being carried out using the leading hrs technology of the mecs company
    the issue of recycling technological heat from the production of sulfuric acid has been resolved in an original way  it is sold to the local
    municipality for the heating of homes

    eurochembmu came out of a long production and economic stagnation  at the end of 2006 losses were liquidated this became
     possible after a set of measures for the reconstruction of production and investment policy were carried out the phosphoric acid
     shop is being reconstructed increasing capacity to 240 thousand tons a new installation for packing production into big bags has
     started to work at the enterprise which enabled not only offering convenient packaging to consumers but also developing a flexible
     storage scheme

    in 2006 production group phosphorit ltd produced 7502 thousand tons of its main product including 5545 thousand tons of mineral
     fertilizer 1957 tons of deflourinated phosphate feed additive for animals




   in the structure of the general product line of fertilizers the volume of ammophos produced was 444 thousand tons which exceeded the
   previous year 2005 level by 495 the production of sulfuric ammophos decreased to 1003 thousand tons 45 the increase in the
   volumes of output of ammophos and the lowering of the volumes of sulfuric ammophos was envisioned in the production program for 2006
   this decision was caused by phosphate fertilizer market trends and the termination of the operation of the unprofitable mining and enrichment
   complex which was closed by decision of the board of directors of eurochem mcc in july of last year

   the production of sulfuric acid for inhouse technical needs took place in accordance with the planned assignments of the current year after the
   reconstruction of the second section of psk in 2005 the capacity established by the design of 700 thousand tons for monohydrate was reached
   for the first time in the past year a total of 7004 tons of sulfuric acid were output the small variation 31 thousand tons less than previous
   years volumes was caused by the withdrawal of the physically deteriorated and ecologically dangerous first section from operation

   the volume of extraction phosphoric acid 100 р2о5 produced for inhouse needs came to 2957 thousand tons and exceeded the
   volumes for the analogous period a year earlier by 28 thousand tons 105 this enabled the output of mineral fertilizers with a higher
   concentration of р2о5
