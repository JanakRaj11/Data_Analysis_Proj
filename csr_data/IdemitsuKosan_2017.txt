petrochemical equipment the overall balance of our energy
mix has deteriorated and it has become difficult to effectively
use recaptured energy as we continue to promote energy
conservation the amount of energy we consume and the
absolute amount of green house gases we emit are decreas

flat the entire company is now focusing its efforts on more
efficiently using energy in 2016 the chiba refinery now the
chiba complex was able to overcome some technical issues
and enabled its refinery to use surplus steam and hydrogen
from its petrochemical plant which will contribute to energy
conservation for the company as a whole
    as for renewable energy initiatives we began supplying
steam for a geothermal power station operated by kyushu
electric power co inc in 1996 since then we established
a wind power station in 2008 a solar power station in 2013
a biomass power station in 2015 and a geothermal binary cycle
power station in march 2017 the power generation capacity of
these renewable energy sources is around 112000 kw
