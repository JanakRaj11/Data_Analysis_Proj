                              case 3 largevolume renewable energy from 5mw offshore wind turbine

                             there is growing interest in renewable energy as a way to contribute to the prevention
                             of global warming among the different types of renewable energy wind power generation
                             is now reaching output and cost levels that are on a par with conventional power
                             generation using fossil fuels and nuclear power these systems are growing in size and
                             sophistication worldwide
                                     hitachi developed a 2mw downwind turbine for use in japans demanding
                             conditions such as typhoon gusts and wind turbulence in its mountainous regions
                             hitachis htw2080 a 2mw wind power generation system has been installed at many
                             sites and maintains a top share in japan we are also participating in offshore floating wind
                             farm demonstration projects sponsored by agencies including the ministry of economy
                             trade and industry and the ministry of the environment the first seven fixedbase
                             offshore wind turbines built in japan commenced operation in 2010 with an additional
                             eight turbines added in 2013
                                     with this experience hitachi has developed a 5mw offshore wind turbine with
                             downwind rotor the htw50126 japan is surrounded by large areas of ocean therefore
                             there is much greater potential for wind power generation than on land offshore wind
                             power generation has few restrictions with respect to siting scenery effects and noise
                             but compared with landbased facilities construction and operation costs are higher and
                             maintenance is difficult this makes it necessary to develop offshore wind power
                             generation systems with high output per unit and high reliability
                                     the htw50126 which has recently been completed meets needs for larger
                             turbines for the offshore wind farms expected to be built in the future compared with
                             our previous 2mw offering this wind power generation system has a rated output of 5mw
                             about 25 times higher and rotor diameter of 126 meters about 15 times greater than
                             the previous systems dimensions the htw50126 system uses a unique configuration
                             developed by hitachi with the rotor located on the downwind side of the tower in this
                             configuration the rotor is maintained in an orientation that does not receive crosswinds
                             during heavy stormseven the typhoons that frequently affect japanthus serving to
                             reduce the wind load moreover with a new combination of a permanent magnet
                             synchronous generator and a mediumspeed gearbox hitachi decreased the weight
                             and size of the entire system with respect to output and improved reliability it is also
                             expected to provide better safety and reduced costs of installing the seabed
                             foundations or floating platforms
                                     hitachi will continue to build our business in the growing wind energy field thereby
                             contributing to the creation of a lowcarbon society

                              case 1 renewing the united kingdoms aging railway network

                             as the birthplace of the railway the united kingdom has a long history of trains and rail
                             networks this was part of the reason that hitachi chose to run its global railway systems
                             operations from a uk base this will provide access to important markets in europe and
                             the middle east and will serve as a platform for expanding our rail capacity globally
                                     the united kingdoms victorian rail infrastructure has been going through a period of
                             continuous upgrade and regeneration in addition to an extensive program of electrification
                             and resignaling stations platforms track and bridges are all being renewed this is to
                             ensure that the united kingdoms railways remain a vital part of its economic activity for many
                             years to come
                                     drawing on our technical expertise built up through work on japans highspeed
                             shinkansen bullet trains and other rail networks hitachi is developing rail vehicles for the
                             united kingdom that flexibly respond to these infrastructure conditions in developing rolling
                             stock for the british intercity express programme iep extending to swansea and plymouth
                             in the west and the major cities of scotland in the north hitachi focuses primarily on safety
                             and environmental performance
                                     we have introduced carefully tested safety measures that fully comply with european
                             regulations safety is the primary key performance indicator for hitachi not just in the rail
                             vehicles we build but also in our factories and all of our rail operations it is also the most
                             important criterion for customers when they select a partnerand a key reason that hitachi
                             was chosen to upgrade and maintain the entire iep fleet in one of the largest rail projects in
                             british railway history
                                     to keep the hitachi trains as environmentally friendly as possible we have focused on
                             reducing the weight of the rail vehicles improving their aerodynamic profile and increasing
                             the percentage of recycled materials that goes into them a quiet train is an energyefficient
                             train vehicle design that reduces rail noise and air resistance leads to lower carbon output
                             and operational costs we are also achieving dramatically shortened travel times journey time
                             on the londonashford portion of the southeastern main line for instance has been
                             shortened from 80 minutes to 37 minutes
                                     furthermore hitachi is increasing energy efficiency through intelligent interior design by
                             maximizing seating capacity without sacrificing passenger comfort we are working closely
                             with the authorities and railway operators to ensure that these clever designs also conform
                             with universal design and other relevant regulations
                                     a railway is more than just trains hitachi is able to offer a complete package to iep
                             operators including rolling stock repair and maintenance and it services allowing smart fully
                             networked operation of the trains our intelligent systems integrate route signaling and
                             onboard systems to let trains communicate with each other by keeping track of where the
                             other trains are on the route our trains can maintain a safe distance with less brakingwhich
                             in turn reduces energy loss
                                     with its development of bimode trains allowing travel on both fully electrified lines and
                             under their own power hitachi is providing flexible adaptable systems with wide applicability
                             our fully integrated approach to the rail business has proven a winning strategy in diversifying

                              case 3 easing congestion with a safe convenient monorail system

                             traffic congestion in south korea is getting worse due to increased concentration of the
                             population in the capital of seoul and in other key cities as well as a rise in the number of
                             automobiles on the roads to address this problem railway systemswhich emit less co2
                             than automobiles on a per passenger basisare being reevaluated and plans for
                             introducing light rail networks such as monorails with relatively low construction costs and
                             smaller environmental footprints are proceeding in a number of cities
                                     the city of daeguthe urban center of koreas southeast region boasting about 25
                             million residentshas been grappling with these same issues the municipal government has
                             settled on a straddletype monorail system as a means of preserving daegus environment of
                             rich greenery and rivers and reducing energy use hitachi has a global record in providing
                             monorail solutions starting with seven systems in japan including the tokyo monorail and
                             extending to systems in chongqing china and in dubai daegu selected us for this project due
                             to our long record as well as the high evaluations of our monorail technology and reliability
                                     daegu metro line 3 koreas first urban monorail system runs nearly 24 kilometers from
                             the northwest to the southeast of the city with 30 stations and 84 cars in 28 train sets it
                             uses a driverless operation system as a provision for ensuring passenger wellbeing in the
                             event of an accident one safety personnel member rides each train and the cars are all
                             equipped with safety systems like fire sprinklers and evacuation equipment that makes it easy
                             for passengers to safely descend from the monorail cars the monorails cuttingedge
                             technology also includes mistglass windows in passenger compartments that automatically
                             turn opaque when the train runs through a residential area thus ensuring the privacy of
                             homes along the line this project is proactively employing korean products thanks to
                             collaboration with local corporations and hitachi korea
                                     daegu metro line 3 began operation on april 23 2015 in addition to improving access
                             to various facilities throughout the city it is expected to have various spillover effects such as
                             the monorail itself becoming a tourist attraction

                               natural disasters on a global scale we are also seeing diversification of other threats that
                               can hinder the operation of social infrastructure such as frequent cyber attacks as urban
                               infrastructure becomes increasingly networked and rises in armed terrorism in response to

                                       daily life and business in modern society are supported by an assortment of
                               services brought to us by social infrastructure such as medical care waterworks

                               infrastructure operators be continuous and stable 24 hours a day and 365 days a year
                               the networking of infrastructural systems that had previously provided service

                               convenient has also been proceeding
                                       since there is a danger that damage from a disaster or accident could affect a
                               larger area following the initial outbreak disaster response has become even more
                               important services provided by social infrastructure depend upon one another and so
                               the wide variety of relevant organizations and operators must all work together while

                             in order to strengthen the security of social infrastructure we must implement appropriate
                             precautionary measures so that services can be maintained even in the event of damage
                             reducing the expansion of harm and its ripple effects while also being increasingly
                             proactive about growing risks all concerned institutions need to work together in a
                             coordinated manner as they strive to enact a swift recovery
                                     we must realize a society robust enough to handle extreme disastersone where
                             people are protected from threats before they are even realized without impacting their
                             convenience or comfort if an accident or attack happens at a largescale international
                             event institutions need to work together to respond quickly protect peoples safety and
                             security while continuing to provide services and continue handling threats as they surface
                             while safeguarding the convenience of ordinary people
                                     at hitachi we believe that social infrastructure security solutions must be adaptive
                             continually strengthening defenses and precautionary countermeasures for novel and
                             diversifying threats responsive seeking to minimize damage and speed up recovery time
                             after a disaster attack or other incident has occurred and cooperative to address
                             incidents via cooperation and information sharing among different organizations and
                             service providers so that they can be aware of each others circumstances we grapple
                             with a broad range of security countermeasures on both the physical and virtual fronts
                                     since its founding hitachi has cultivated a range of individual technologies in the
                             course of providing social infrastructure to the world and worked to integrate them toward
                             further protection of safety and security we continue to provide comprehensive solutions
                             that cover everything from risk analysis and consulting to system establishment and
                             operational support


                              case 1 keeping major facilities both convenient and secure against diversified threats

                             in todays society where threats of terrorism and violent crime have risen markedly
                             expectations have also grown for security systems that help to ensure societal safety and
                             security threats to largescale facilities like event halls sports facilities airports and
                             stations where people assemble or transit are more diverse than simple terrorism they
                             also include flooding due to torrential rain largescale blackouts and transit outages
                             providing safety and security requires physical security employing it or other advanced
                             technology in addition to human security like guards in environments with highvolume
                             traffic by people over a large area more advanced security technologies are also needed
                             to avoid hindering the convenience of ordinary users
                                     in the three fields of personal authentication explosives detection and suspicious
                             person tracking technology hitachi has been developing security technology that
                             promotes safety and convenience linking this technology with it systems makes it
                             possible to detect explosives inside a persons luggage identify that persons movements
                             within the facility and keep track of the individuals location these hitachi solutions also
                             enable highly convenient security services necessary for safety evaluation by checking
                             which people and items are safe based on the results of personal authentication and
                             detection of explosives

                             hitachi has developed a device that can rapidly detect substances adhering to an object
                             or person such as the raw materials for an explosive this technology uses pipes to
                             collect air samples from multiple points within the facility at the same time pulls the air
                             samples into a material analysis device and determines the location of raw materials from
                             the information obtained by comparing different combinations of those spatially dispersed
                             samples among other steps this allows the quick efficient detection of dangerous
                             material without the need to use multiple expensive mass spectrometers

                              case 2 defense in depth to protect against rising cyber attack threats

                             particularly in newly emerging economies installation is underway of social infrastructure
                             that forms the basis for economic development at the same time demand for renovation
                             of social infrastructure is also growing in developed nations where such infrastructure is
                             aging fast in response to these needs and in order to actualize highly reliable systems at a
                             low price we have seen increasing usage of generalpurpose platforms that can be used
                             in multiple social infrastructure control systems and as infrastructure has grown more
                             convenient we have increasingly networked it to other devices or systems thus increasing
                             connectivity to the internet as a whole
                                     as a result control systems for social infrastructure have taken the first steps from
                             being a closed environment to becoming an open one due to the global sharing of
                             technology and their connections to the digital sphere their risk of suffering cyber attack
                             has increased accordingly control systems for social infrastructure are expected to
                             continue providing service 24 hours a day 365 days a year and if this infrastructure stops
                             even briefly the damage could expand and paralyze urban functionality particularly in the
                             field of cybersecurity where new viruses and software allowing fraudulent operation of
                             systems are constantly being developed it is increasingly difficult to head off all potential
                             problems during the development stage in the event of an attack the key is to issue a
                             warning quickly and respond instantaneously in order to minimize the damage


                             defense in depth to minimize damage to control systems
                             hitachi provides products and solutions to implement security measures for the control
                             systems that support social infrastructure taking into consideration the need for this
                             infrastructure to operate reliably over the long term and the factor of a rising tide of
                             cyber attacks
                                     hitachi focuses on defense in depth when strengthening security for control
                             systems for example we enhance security by establishing defense points in several
                             layers of a system if the outermost firewall is pierced then there is still another security
                             layer after that one and further layers inside of that first an outermost layer guards
                             against intrusions from the network into control systems or leaks for particularly critical
                             systems we provide unidirectional connectivity devices that block off access from the
                             external network we provide units for monitoring and rejecting untrustworthy pcs to
                             quickly detect an attacker or virus that has penetrated the system and to prevent access
                             to important data or functionality we are also developing solutions that use special decoy
                             servers to recognize malware that has penetrated at an early stage capture it and analyze
                             it hitachi solutions promote stronger security functionality overall alongside the hardening
                             of each component of the control system

                             since fiscal 2012 we have been organizing town hall meetings bringing together senior
                             management and employees we held around 80 town hall meetings at operations in
                             and outside japan during the first two years and in fiscal 2014 the chairman and ceo
                             and the president and coo attended 45 meetings in the united states china and the
                             philippines as well as in japan and elsewhere
                                     ordinary business meetings and conferences are limited in agenda and our
                             communications to employees via our intranet and other channels tend to be oneway
                             town hall meetings meanwhile are intended as forums for direct dialogue where
                             employees can gain a real sense of senior managements way of thinking and what is
                             needed for hitachi to make the next leap forward as well as occasions for reaching a
                             shared understanding of the work in which they are involved
                                     in the town hall meetings we believe that it is important for senior management to
                             hear the thoughts of frontline employees and for both sides to share their awareness as
                             they engage in dialogue on diverse topics such as how we can grow our business


                              working with governments and public policymakers

                             external relations initiatives
                             the social infrastructure field draws particularly strong interest from the public sector in
                             the task of globally expanding our social innovation business the government
                             institutions that are the main agents for social infrastructure represent important
                             partners to hitachi both as customers and as backers the japanese government has
                             implemented a support structure for infrastructure systems that are being exported with
                             the goal of strengthening japans industrial competitiveness our access to these
                             systems and to government advice is enormously helpful
                                     in our relations with government institutions outside japan we gather policy
                             information from a range of sources frequently engaging with government officials this
                             dialogue ensures that we have a solid grasp of local social issues and business needs
                             allowing us to help build better societies for hitachi relationships with government
                             institutions in and outside japan are becoming increasingly important


                             promoting external relations
                             the government  external relations division was established within our headquarters
                             in fiscal 2009 to guide and accelerate the external relations of the entire hitachi group
                             this was in response to our 2015 midterm management plan which focuses on the
                             global expansion of our social innovation business as well as the growing support
                             offered by the japanese government for infrastructure system exports through this
                             division we are working to strengthen government officials dialogue with hitachi senior
                             management and with the external relations staff in our business divisions and group
                             companies we intend to provide government institutions with a better understanding of
                             our business and to offer policy recommendations on key comprehensive policy issues
                             with the prospect of stimulating the industry as a whole
                                     outside japan we have offices in washington dc and brussels to monitor policy
                             trends and to manage external relations initiatives in the united states and europe
                                     to promote external relations groupwide we hold an annual group meeting to share

environmental management strategies and initiatives


                              hitachis approach


                             the worlds population having passed the 7 billion mark in 2011 is
                             expected to reach 95 billion by 20501 at the same time worldwide gdp
                             continues to grow this economic growthled by emerging countries
                             has led to global warming caused by a rise in co2 emissions from
                             growing fossil fuel use the depletion of energy water mineral reserves
                             and other resources due to increased demand as well as ecosystem
                             destruction and other environmental problems are also worsening
                                  hitachi believes that to solve these environmental problems and to
                             realize a sustainable society where humankind can thrive we must do
                             everything possible to reduce the burden of human activities on the
                             environment with the environment as an important management focus
                             therefore we are working to reduce the environmental burden of our
                             business operations as well as to raise awareness of environmental
                             issues among all hitachi group employees
                                  guided by the environmental vision whose aim is the achievement of
                             a sustainable society hitachis environmental management seeks to
                             attain the goals of the longterm plan environmental vision 2025 and the
                             environmental action plan

                               to the reduction of co 2 emissions through products and services expanding our
                               lineup of hitachi ecoproducts and reducing energy use per unit


                                 the percentage of hitachi ecoproduct sales rose to 93 compared to the fiscal
                                 2014 target of 88
                                 we contributed to the reduction of an estimated 3219 million tonnes of
                                 co2 emissions through products and services exceeding the fiscal 2014 target of
                                 28 million tonnes

                               arguments that have been made for some time confirms once again that reducing co2 and
                               other greenhouse gases is essential for the prevention of global warming

            core policy        promoting the environmental action plan

                              our environmental action plan was created and designed to carry out the measures in our
                              action guidelines for environmental conservation this plan sets improvement targets for
                              specific areas and environmental initiatives are promoted by executing and improving activities
                              in every area to give our environmental strategy a more prominent role in our management
                              strategy we are promoting the environmental action plan as a threeyear plan aligning it with
                              the midterm management plan for the hitachi group covering fiscal 2013 to 2015
                                      we have also begun drafting the 2018 environmental action plan for fiscal 2016 to
                              2018 to be implemented concurrently with the next midterm management plan to be
                              decided in fiscal 2016

                             these regulations and policies as potential business risks at the same time efforts in
                             individual countries and regions to reduce co2 emissions are helping to expand our

                             risks and opportunities presented by physical factors
                             global warming is leading to extreme weather conditions such as more powerful typhoons
                             and heavier rainfall causing natural disasters worldwide hitachi has had its share of
                             damage including flooding of southeast asian business sites and submersion of areas
                             surrounding business sites in japan due to river embankments giving way in china we
                             face challenges in the areas of water quality and procurement of the water needed for
                             manufacturing these issues present risks that could reduce production capacity and raise
                             operational costs as well as threaten the continuity of our business operations
                                     meanwhile in response to growing worldwide demand for measures against natural
                             disasters business is expanding for disasterprevention information systems and other
                             disasterrelated products and services this produces new business opportunities for
                             companies that contribute to the development of a sustainable society that can cope with

                             climate as well as supplementary data that is updated every day


                             other risks and opportunities
                             if our initiatives to tackle global warming are insufficient conceivable risks include a
                             loss of reputation and market rejection of products and services that are not
                             environmentally conscious
                                     measures against droughts related to climate change are now an urgent issue and
                             interest is growing toward hitachis water environment solutions business in regions

environmentally conscious products and services


                                  hitachis approach

                                 demand for products and services is increasing against the backdrop of
                                 megatrends like population growth and advancing urbanization
                                 accompanying economic development at the same time global warming
                                 resource depletion ecosystem destruction and other environmental
                                 problems are worsening
                                     hitachi believes that reflecting environmental consciousness in its
                                 products and services is vital to building a sustainable society to
                                 reduce the environmental burden of products and services throughout
                                 their life cycle therefore we are developing and expanding the ratio of
                                 products called ecoproducts which meet standards for environmental
                                 consciousness recycling product resources and managing chemical
                                 substances
                                     in particular we have set three key performance indicators kpis to
                                 guide our efforts ecoproduct sales ratio number of ecoproducts
                                 select and contributions of the products to co2 emission reductions



                                   our actions in fiscal 2014
                                   during fiscal 2014 we continued our efforts to reduce the environmental burden of
                                   products and services throughout their life cycle also in regard to design and
                                   development outside japan we are moving forward with a planned approach to
                                   expanding the lineup of ecoproducts


                                     our ecoproduct sales ratio reached 93
                                     the number of ecoproducts select models increased by 133 from fiscal 2013
                                     bringing the total to 343 products
                                     the annual contribution to co2 reduction through products was an estimated 3219
                                     million tonnes exceeding the target of 28 million tonnes
                                     we collected around 68000 tonnes of endoflife home appliances of which we
                                     recycled approximately 60000 tonnes we also collected some 13000 tonnes of
                                     endoflife it and industrial products recycling about 12000 tonnes of this




                               promoting ecoproducts


 policies and frameworks          increasing the ratio of ecoproducts

                                 we develop environmentally conscious products called ecoproducts as part of our initiative
                                 to reduce the environmental burden of our products and services as much as possible
                                         ecoproducts must meet criteria used in the design and development stages when
                                 we evaluate the extent to which their environmental burden can be reduced to promote
                                 their development we have set targets for raising the ecoproduct sales ratio a figure
                                 measuring ecoproduct sales against total product sales
                                         ecoproducts that meet even more demanding requirements are designated as eco
                                 products select we are also working to produce more of these products

            key approaches               hitachi products helping to reduce co2 emissions

                                        in fiscal 2014 we expect to achieve a reduction in co2 emissions through products of
                                        3219 million tonnes better than the target of 28 million tonnes major contributions to this
                                        achievement came from the products and services of our power systems company
                                        infrastructure systems company information  telecommunication systems company
   contribution of hitachi products     hitachi appliances and hitachi construction machinery we plan to work even harder to
     and services to the reduction
                    co2 emissions       develop and popularize other products that contribute to co2 emission reductions


            key approaches               addressing our carbon footprint

                                        the carbon footprint of products cfp is the co2 equivalent of the total amount of
                                        greenhouse gases ghgs emitted over the entire life cycle of a product or servicefrom
                                        procurement of materials through to disposal and recycling making the ghg emission
                                        amount visible in this way boosts consumer interest in buying products with low carbon
                                        emissions and encourages businesses to reduce the amount of carbon emitted by their
                                        products over the whole life cycle a number of countries around the world use the cfp
                                        approach
                                                we participate in the carbon footprint communication program of the japan
                                        environmental management association for industry jemai and are working to expand

           core policy          promoting global warming countermeasures

                               we are promoting ways to use energy more efficiently and reduce ghg emissions during
                               production and transportation in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing divisions to
                               help prevent global warming


               results          actions and achievements

                               we are working to reduce the energy use per unit as one way to use energy more
                               efficiently in fiscal 2014 we achieved a reduction of 16 from fiscal 2005 the base year
                               surpassing the target of 13 to achieve further reductions we are systematically
                               installing highefficiency equipment and devices from led lighting to inverter air
                               conditioners and increasing the efficiency of our energy usage by improving
                               manufacturing processes we are also visually displaying energy use data at inhouse and
                               group companies as an incentive to make further improvements

                 core policy            calculation of ghg emissions throughout the value chain

                                       we calculate greenhouse gas ghg emissions throughout the entire value chain to more
                                       effectively reduce these emissions as over 90 of emissions come from use of the
                                       products we have sold we are working to reduce emissions by developing ecoproducts
                                       that meet environmentally conscious criteria throughout their life cycle

                                 hitachi has developed a waste management system aimed at more efficient processes
                                 and reduced compliance risk this system enables better waste management through
                                 visualization of waste produced at locations from small offices with lower waste volumes
                                 to larger business sites and contract operations it is also being used as a tool for
                                 keeping track of waste volume and to share methods for more effective use of resources
                                 from fiscal 2014 it has also been used at business sites outside of japan to closely

                                to prevent air pollution we have cut emissions from 41 volatile organic compounds vocs
                                designated on the basis of a scheme by the japanese ministry of the environment
                                initiatives in fiscal 2014 to reduce voc emissions included switching from paints containing
                                vocs to watersoluble and powder paints expanding the use of stainless steel and plated
                                sheet steel chassis and altering washing processes we successfully achieved our targets
                                through these initiatives we also monitor and manage emissions of sulfur oxides sox and

                              increased worldwide in relation to working environments business practices
                              in each region and supplier relations that are different from region to region
                              moreover corporations are expected to address human rights issues in
                              accordance with international standards such as the un guiding principles
                              on business and human rights

                             environment and ethics in fiscal 2014 audit results revealed no major infringements at
                             the 20 companies but made note of some small areas needing improvement such as
                             overtime work exceeding stipulated limits 18 companies failure to conduct periodic
                             inspections of machinery and equipment 16 and insufficient management of hazardous
                             waste 10 we have asked these suppliers to submit improvement action plans and will be
                             working with and advising them until they complete the planned improvements

        key approaches        creation of procurement bcps

                             we have a deep involvement in social infrastructures in places where the suppliers who are
                             our business partners can be affected by major earthquakes and other natural disasters
                                     these disasters can heavily impact not only our business operations and those of our
                             suppliers but also society as a whole to minimize this impact the procurement divisions in
                             key group and inhouse companies in japan have created procurement business
                             continuity plans bcps that 1 standardize and use generic parts to make procurement as
                             flexible as possible 2 cultivate multiple suppliers 3 distribute production across several
                             locations 4 budget inventory strategically and 5 consider substitute products to see
                             whether or not procurement bcps would be effective we held desktop exercises to
                             discuss in a group what should be done during and after a disaster making further
                             improvements as a result in fiscal 2014 group companies in japan took the same steps
                             to improve procurement bcps the initiative will expand to group companies outside

                              we built the hitachi group health and safety portal system in 2012 to ensure that
                              every hitachi group company in japan can track the health and safety performance of
                              the entire hitachi group
                                      groupwide information on work accidents is registered in the system so that
                              companies can track causes and see what preventive measures have been initiated to
                              help prevent recurrences statistics are kept on types of accidents since 2014 we

global human capital development


                               hitachis approach

                              as the role of corporations expands with respect to global social issues
                              like the environment poverty and human rights hitachi seeks to address
                              the needs and values of its diverse array of stakeholders including central
                              and local governmental bodies local communities and customers with
                              the goal of developing the social innovation business around the globe
                                   in order to secure the human resources needed to deal with those
                              issues we are seeking to globalize its human capital by recruiting and
                              training employees from a variety of countries while also building up an
                              array of facilities around the world so that our diverse employees can
                              demonstrate their full potential and continually develop themselves


                                our actions in fiscal 2014
                                hitachi has built the global human capital database to enable visualization of
                                worldwide human capital throughout the group while also introducing a global
                                grading system as a common platform for groupwide job evaluations we have
                                also introduced and expanded our performance management system to
                                continually improve and develop both our business and the individual skills of our
                                employees on top of this we have introduced common global hiring systems as
                                a way to secure talented personnel boost efficiency and reduce hiring costs

                                  in fiscal 2015 we hired around 60 foreign nationals who had graduated from
                                  universities inside and outside japan as well as around 20 japanese nationals who
                                  earned degrees at universities outside japan
                                  a process was implemented to send results from the hitachi insights survey of global
                                  employees directly to managers
                                  in fiscal 2013 employees in hitachi ltd and 20 group companies in japan received
                                  an average of 379 hours of training per person and 85300 yen per person was
                                  invested for education



            core policy        advancing global human capital

                              our groupwide global human capital management strategy optimizes both human resources
                              and organizational performance in pursuit of hitachis goal of becoming a major global player
                                    one example of our initiatives is the global human capital database covering all
                              hitachi group employees excluding factory workers outside japan this database
                              enables us to fully ascertain the status of worldwide group human capital and to assess
                              macro management data such as the allocation of human resources we have also built
                              a global grading system that applies to all managers in the hitachi group worldwide
                              using it as a common platform for job evaluations throughout the entire group and as a
                              common standard for assessing the value of management duties
                                    in addition we introduced a performance management system at hitachi ltd and
                              at some group companies worldwide to link the operational business goals and
                              individual skills of both sides with the aim of mutual sustained improvement and
                              growth this system will be expanded to include more companies with an eye to
                              supporting the advancement of employees as our global operations expand we are
                              introducing common global hiring systems to secure talented personnel boost
                              efficiency and reduce hiring costs

        key approaches        conducting a global employee survey

                             in 2013 we conducted our first global employee survey hitachi insights as a way of
                             measuring employee engagement1 in september 2014 the survey was administered for
                             the second time around 190000 employees worldwide were sent the survey in one of 13
                             different languages and roughly 160000 responses were received
                                     overall among the 13 categories hitachi scored well in pride in your company and
                             your supervisors management suggesting that employees are proud of hitachi and its
                             drive to become a major global player underpinned by sustainable growth a poor score
                             for resources and support indicates that we can do better on the level of staffing as well
                             as information and resource tools
                                     compared to the first survey there were improvements in all of the categories which
                             seems to demonstrate that forwardlooking changes were made in each organization
                             within hitachi based on studying the results of the survey and implementing
                             improvements looking forward we intend to continue making improvements while
                             thoroughly adhering to the pdca plan do check act cycle
                                     in fiscal 2014 we also introduced a process whereby the survey results are directly
                             sent to section and department heads these managers can use the results to ascertain
                             the situations for their respective teams and to improve engagement with the team through
                             communication with the members the range of employees who will receive this direct
                             communication is being expanded in 2015 and we will also be providing assistance to the
                             section and department heads for actions they wish to take based on the survey output
                             with an eye to further raising the level of engagement throughout hitachi

                             1 hitachi uses the term engagement to refer to employees understanding of the companys strategies and
                                policies as well as their job satisfaction and desire to take actions on their own initiative to bring about results




        key approaches        career development in the workplace

                             because we regard the workplace as the center of career development our career
                             development support emphasizes growth in daily work hitachis global performance
                             management gpm uses performance planning with employees and their supervisors
                             discussing and agreeing on shortterm work goals we also use career consultations for
                             gaining mutual understanding of medium to longterm career plans as well as training
                             and skills development to boost individual employees engagement and motivation and to
                             advance their careers in the workplace repeating the gpm cycle improves individual
                             performance and further increases motivation and creativity this in turn spurs individual
                             growth and improves organizational results
                                     hitachi administers the career counseling center to provide workrelated advice to
                             employees as part of our career development support trained counselors at the center
                             engage in dialogue to help employees proactively address their own concerns related to
                             their careers and relations with colleagues some of those concerns include the desire to
                             find a career path that suits their aptitudes and values or to find a way to better balance
                             work with their private lives the counselors at the center are also required to regularly
                             participate in a training program following a uscertified career counseling curriculum in

                             career development through education and workshops that encourage employee
                             awareness of their internal careersin other words their reasons for working and the
                             significance they place on it these programs are geared to individuals career
                             development and stages covering everyone from young employees to more senior
                             workers the hitachi career development workshop hcdw launched in fiscal 2002 as
                             an initiative across group companies in japan is a key program that targets middleaged
                             employees who have work experience and who play a central role in the workplace
                                     in fiscal 2014 hitachi began recommending that all employees promoted to
                             supervisory positons attend the hcdw with the aim of giving them the opportunity to
                             participate in the workshop at an earlier stage in their careers participants use self
                             analysis to deepen their selfunderstanding with an emphasis on their internal careers
                             affirming their career direction goals and paths so that they can direct the development of
                             their own career and skills
                                     hitachi is providing career development support to middleaged employees through
                             life plan training made available to employees 50 years or older or managerial
                             employees from the age of 45 as well as the life plan briefing for employees who have
                             reached the age of around 58 life plan training is aimed at encouraging employees to
                             think for themselves about how they can take actions and make preparations for their
                             career and life plans rather than waiting until they reach retirement age toward that end
                             the training provides various knowledge that is useful when considering styles of working
                             and living as well as information on company support systems for the life plan briefing

        key approaches        quality and reliability education

                             our training programs for all technical and skill levels at divisions working in design and
                             quality assurance cover reliability basic and advanced and product safety in fiscal 2011
                             we reinforced our monozukuri practices by beginning an elearning program for the more
                             than 120000 hitachi engineers around the world since fiscal 2012 we have operated
                             another elearning program that draws on the results of analyses of past product accidents
                             to identify weaknesses that our engineers must be able to ascertain understand and
                             overcome in their daily work over 70000 engineers have gone through the program
                                  quality assurance qa training centers at our manufacturing sites help to increase
                             production quality assurance and maintenance skills through their own specialized
                             technical courses



        key approaches        qa systems in china and throughout asia

                             as production volume has been increasing in china and other asian nations we are
                             reinforcing systems and training to improve product quality from these locations for
                             example we host conferences for qa managers in china and thailand to improve quality
                             awareness and to share information and best practices
                                  to develop employees qa skills and to improve their quality awareness and inspection
                             techniques we provide reliability training courses at three levels in beijing shanghai and
                             guangzhou in china and in bangkok thailand the basic reliability course1 intermediate
                             reliability course2 and advanced reliability course in the advanced reliability course
                             managers hold group discussions on past product accidents to identify the root causes
                             including the processrelated organizational and psychological factors the goals are to
                             boost problem identification and problemsolving skills

                             1 basic reliability course deepens understanding of such basic issues as hitachis monozukuri craftsmanship
                                quality management and labor safety
                             2 intermediate reliability course improves understanding of more practical issues in for example hitachi
                                monozukuri craftsmanship iso 9001 certification defect elimination design for reliability and purchasing and
                                vendor management



        key approaches        ensuring home appliance safety

                             we are reducing consumer appliance accidents to near zero levels in line with hitachis
                             customer satisfaction cs management guidelines which set avoidance of all product
                             accidents as the baseline for example since fiscal 1987 we have been testing worstcase
                             scenarios such as deliberately setting a fire inside a product to confirm that the fire will not
                             spread outside it since fiscal 2006 we have also been conducting product safety risk
                             assessments at the development stage creating accidents that might be caused by misuse
                                  of the fires in electrical products that occurred in japan during fiscal 2014 room air
                             conditioner accidents including outside units were the most common accounting for 64
                             incidents1 no hitachi air conditioners were involved in these accidents reflecting the strength
                             of the hitachi group qf innovation movement we will continue to make all our consumer
                             appliances even safer using our own voluntary action plan for product safety so that customers
                             can use our products with confidence

                              will evaluate the buyout proposal of the party and hold negotiations with the buyer and if

                              the best interest of the shareholders then the company will quickly determine the
                              necessity content etc of specific countermeasures and prepare to implement them the
                              same response will also be taken in the event a party attempts to acquire a large

                              activities but also to get involved as a community member in the local
                              communities where it does its business

                                         workshops with sumida aquarium to nurture students scientific minds
                                         hitachi chemical co ltd has teamed up with sumida aquarium in tokyo since 2013 to
                                         hold a series of smallgroup workshops titled discovering the mysteries of water
                                         creatures in fiscal 2014 nine workshops were held with around 60 elementary school
                                         students participating
                                                 observers note that elementary school teachers in japan tend to have backgrounds in
participants in the discovering the
mysteries of water creatures event at
                                         the humanities rather than science so there are few teachers able to teach science and
sumida aquarium                         conduct experiments in a proactive creative way this lack of teachers specializing in
                                         science is thought to be one of the reasons that interest in science has been declining
                                         among japanese children the workshop series was brought about by the collaboration
                                         between hitachi chemical which has experience in planning and conducting science
                                         related programs and sumida aquarium which is interested in offering programs that can
                                         spark participants interest in science the workshops give children an opportunity to
                                         encounter science outside of school in the hope that these events will spark their interest
                                         and lead some of them to later pursue a scientific career we plan to continue these kinds

                                         supporting science and math education in hitachi city
                                         the city of hitachis educational objectives are to foster an interest in science and to
                                         cultivate the creativity and originality of children on an international stage hitachi ltd
                                         approves of these objectives and in fiscal 2009 concluded a basic agreement to work with
                                         the city on programs that enrich science and mathematics education the hitachi science

                                         school students with a strong interest in science and mathematics a particularly popular
                                         aspect of the program is the monozukuri workshops where students and former hitachi
                                         engineers build devices like waterpowered rockets made from plastic bottles windmills
                                         and propellerdriven cars
                                                 these initiatives are based on the view that children naturally tend to be familiar with
                                         nature and science but are moving away from science because of a lack of firsthand
                                         opportunities this makes it important for them to be exposed to science while in
                                         elementary school in order to foster their scientific dreams

           key approaches                  creating bcps in key operations worldwide

                                          given the close relation of our business to social infrastructure we are enhancing our
                                          bcps to ensure that the impact of risks does not disrupt our business and thereby
                                          significantly affect society in december 2006 we issued the hitachi group guidelines for
                                          developing business continuity plans in japanese in fiscal 2010 these were translated

department version                             when the great east japan earthquake struck in march 2011 our bcps enabled
                                          quick responses and swift decision making however issues emerged including
                                          identification of secondary and other suppliers cloud storage and multiplexing of
                                          production information and the need to secure alternate transportation and fuel sources
                                                  based on the lessons learned from this disaster in october 2011 we released and
                                          distributed new bcp guidelines for departmental implementation to further improve our

           key approaches                  improving safety for employees sent to dangerous regions

                                          responding to the hostage incident in algeria in january 2013 president hiroaki nakanishi
                                          reinforced his policy in february 2013 of ensuring the safety of employees sent outside
                                          japan survey missions of inhouse and outside experts are now sent beforehand to areas
                                          at high risk of war terrorism and other threats even after employees are dispatched to
                                          such areas we conduct additional local surveys every six months as a means of confirming
                                          the effectiveness of our safety policies in fiscal 2014 survey missions were sent to several
                                          countries in africa and the middle east in addition we have introduced a range of safety
                                          measures in the light of recent terrorist incidents involving japanese and other nationals
                                          including providing timely alerts to employees these and other steps underscore our
                                          commitment to ensuring the safety of our employees working around the globe
                                                  hitachi is also contributing to safety measures at other japanese corporations
                                          operating outside japan to help enhance collaboration between the private and
                                          public sectors in this area hitachi executives participated in the council for public

           core policy         ensuring awareness of the hitachi group codes of conduct

                              hitachi ltd formulated the hitachi group codes of conduct as a common conduct
                              code for the hitachi group in fiscal 2010 we issued the hitachi group codes of
                              conduct handbook in fiscal 2011 as a guidebook for all employees as of march 2015

                              conduct to deepen awareness of the codes throughout our global operations we have
                              produced english and chinese versions of a japaneselanguage elearning tool

                              companies within and outside japan we also conduct compliance training that

       key approaches          compliance reporting system

                              hitachi has instituted a groupwide whistleblowing system to prevent illegal and
                              unethical behavior to promptly address infractions and to enhance our ability to
                              selfregulate
                                      in this system reports go directly to the compliance department at hitachi or to an
                              outside attorney this system can be used not only by hitachi employees but also by
                              former employees temporary staff and suppliers in addition we have implemented the
                              channel to the board of directors system to allow employees to directly report problems
                              anonymously to hitachi directors the facts related to all reports are subject to thorough
                              investigation and checking and people who have identified themselves in the reports are
                              informed of the investigation results we make every effort to appropriately deal with
                              situations including taking remedial action where necessary


       key approaches          preventing bribery and corrupt practices

                              to deal with global bribery and corruption risks in fiscal 2013 we referred to the us
                              foreign corrupt practices act resource guide1 and other documents to develop various
                              corruption risk scenarios these were used as the basis for a survey conducted at hitachi
                              group companies outside japan by analyzing the survey results we identified several
                              companies at risk from corruption we are monitoring and working with those companies
                              with the goal of reducing corruption worldwide

                              1 the us foreign corrupt practices act consists of antibribery provisions regarding foreign government officials and
                                 transparent accounting provisions within the securities exchange act enforced by the department of justice it
                                 prohibits bribes to foreign government officials transparent accounting enforced by the securities and exchange
                                 commission requires companies to show transactions fairly and accurately in their accounting records and to
                                 maintain effective internal control over accounting

       key approaches         preventing violations of fair competition laws

                             hitachi engages in business based on the principles of conformance with the law and
                             business ethics and fair and disciplined competition however hitachi ltd was found
                             to have impaired the fairness of a public bid in fiscal 2002 and was penalized in
                             september 2006 october 2008 and march 2009 for violating the japanese
                             antimonopoly law
                                     in november 2012 a subsidiary dealing in automotive components was penalized
                             by the japan fair trade commission for violating the antimonopoly law in
                             september 2013 the same company was prosecuted by the us department of
                             justice for violating american antitrust laws resulting in a plea bargain
                                     we are working to prevent further violations and to broaden awareness of
                             compliance issues including publicizing messages from top executives developing
                             company regulations conducting regular audits and providing education and
                             training to employees based on a compliance manual in fiscal 2014 we held group
                             education sessions on the antimonopoly law for all hitachi sales managers with
                             957 taking part
                                     through these initiatives we will continue working to improve and enhance our
                             compliance framework


       key approaches         prevention of antisocial transactions

                             to cut off all relationships with organized crime groups and other antisocial forces we
                             observe the following three provisions laid out in the hitachi group codes of conduct
                             1 we will have no relations whatsoever with antisocial forces such as organized
                                crime groups and we will never engage in antisocial transactions under any
                                circumstances
                             2 we will prevent antisocial transactions through selfinspection of our transactions
                             3 we will oppose antisocial forces such as organized crime groups with firm resolve
                                and refuse any improper demands
                                     the entire hitachi group acts decisively to eliminate approaches from antisocial
                             forces in partnership with where necessary the police external specialist institutions
                             the national center for the elimination of boryokudan and tokuboren the federation
                             on special organized crimes within jurisdiction of the metropolitan police
                             department and lawyers we include an organized crime elimination clause in
                             contracts so that if it is determined that a business partner belongs to an antisocial
                             group we can void the contract and break off the relationship

       key approaches         education on information security

                             consistently maintaining information security requires all parties to continually develop their
                             knowledge of information handling and to remain strongly aware of the issues for this
                             reason we hold annual elearning programs on information security and personal
                             information protection for all directors employees and temporary employees
                                     nearly all of the roughly 40000 employees at hitachi ltd participate in these
                             programs we provide specific additional training with clear goals that is geared to new

                             targeted email attacks and other cyberattacks employees are sent examples of targeted
                             email to heighten their awareness of security through direct experience
                                     our educational programs available to hitachi group companies in japan and
                             overseas provide groupwide education on information security and personal
                             information protection

                             not allowed to audit their own units underlining our commitment to fairness and
                             objectivity in auditing hitachi group companies in japan conduct audits in the same
                             way as hitachi ltd and all results are subject to confirmation for hitachi group
