                                      clientcentric global universal bank as one of the key elements of
                                      this strategy we committed ourselves to placing deutsche bank at
                                      the forefront of cultural change in our industry restoring the bond
                                      of trust with society is a top priority  for the banking industry and for
                                      deutsche bank

                                      we are under no illusions we recognize that deep cultural change is a
                                      process of years not months during 2013 we laid important foundations
                                      for sustainable longterm change we defined a new set of values and
                                      beliefs which define the type of institution deutsche bank aspires to be
                                       we developed these after seeking the views of some 52000 of our
                                      staff and launched them in our organization in july with the help of

                                our priority now is to embed these values and beliefs in everyday
                                behaviors to achieve this we have changed the way we measure and
                                manage performance for example adherence to our values and b   eliefs

                                 deutsche bank staff

                                the path to cultural change also involves reinforcing our internal controls
                                during 2013 we significantly strengthened our legal and compliance
                                capabilities and enhanced our risk management mechanisms in addition
                                we are further reinforcing our control model across businesses control
                                functions and group audit  our three lines of defense against potential
                                problems as we strengthen deutsche bank for the future we are also
                                decisively dealing with litigation matters arising from the past in 2013
                                we settled some of the most significant cases relating to legacy issues
                                and successfully defended the bank in others

                                as part of our commitment to a strong risk culture we developed and
                                refined the ways in which we assess environmental and social risks
                                  we seek to provide products and services that create value for society
                                 and respond to global challenges such as climate change in 2013
                                 we established new mechanisms for investing according to clear
                                 environmental social and governance criteria we introduced new
                                  ways of assessing the balance between clients and shareholders
                                  needs we were also one of the leading financiers of renewable energy
                                  projects we know that this is an area of much debate covering different
                                  opinions attitudes and interests we seek to play an active role in that
                                  debate by engaging in lively and wideranging dialogue with stakeholders
                                  who have different perspectives these commitments are also reflected

                                             creating value for all our stakeholders however is often a delicate balancing act
                                             as the interests and priorities of various groups are not always identical our products
                                             and services must primarily meet clients financial needs and objectives and also
                                             provide adequate financial return for the bank at the same time they should create
                                              benefits rather than risks for society or the environment at times it is difficult to
                                             fulfill these criteria all at once still we consistently strive to increase the importance
                                             of nonfinancial factors in our core business

                                             the overall benefit of our business is clear it facilitates capital flows and fuels
                                             economic development this in turn supports reaching global goals such as

                                              responsibility to further strengthen these benefits while also taking into consideration
                                              and curbing the possible negative consequences of our business we have pursued

a strong risk culture depends as
 much on attitudes and behaviors as it
 does on effective controls my team
 develops and implements initiatives
 aimed both at raising awareness and
 at understanding risk across the bank
 as well as creatinga strong link
 between behavior and compensation
  this helps drive a culture in which
  employees take responsibility for
  their actions

    a strong control framework must be accompanied

    regulations or legislation we have strengthened our

                                behaviors for the banks longterm success this program emphasizes five behaviors
                                that employees need to demonstrate

                                 being fully responsible for the banks risks
                                 being rigorous forwardlooking and comprehensive in assessing risk

                                the importance of adhering to these behaviors is communicated through a variety of

                                flags are riskweighted depending on the severity and frequency of the incident
                                aggregated red flag scores are taken into account in reviews of performance pay

                                since its inception the red flags process has been rolled out to corporate banking and

                                and the noncore operations unit further rollouts are planned throughout 2014

                                employee trading are relevant to all divisions and functions other categories such as
                                unauthorized crossings of chinese walls or credit limits are specific to each divisions
                                risk profile red flag categories are reviewed on a regular basis  new indicators may

                                the system is designed to promote compliance and where possible we help employees
                                to avoid red flags for example employees receive automated email reminders
                                when they are enrolled in mandatory training or when they need to take mandatory
                                time away supervisors are also able to access information on risks and policy breaches

                                since introducing red flags the number of breaches has decreased steadily indicating
                                a positive change in riskrelated behaviors

                                 npl in a country that suffered from the realestate crisis the banking sector was
                                heavily criticized by the public for mismanagement during the crisis the transaction
                                itself would have provided a meaningful revenue opportunity for deutsche bank
                                was well structured and would have increased the banks market share in that region
                                significantly the npl transaction was reviewed however due to strong concerns
                                regarding public perception and regional reputation the transaction was not approved

                                taking risks is part of our business model as we lay out in our values we are committed
                                to doing what is right not only what is legally allowed thus we must consider risks
                                that go beyond the traditional financial risks intrinsic to our business such as credit
                                and market risk we evaluate potential environmental and social es risks that could

                                 they should be mitigated as much as possible through implementing the appropriate

                                  such as monocultures land grabbing and palm oil

                                  in october 2013 we hosted the eighth dialogue session within the forum bankendialog

                                  consistent with zero net deforestation by 2020 as based on the standards that the

                                as a leading global bank we inevitably have relationships with some companies that
                                are involved in activities with potentially significant environmental or social risks
                                we monitor developments in these industries and aim to engage with clients in these
                                sectors following initial analysis we seek dialogue with clients to promote transparency
                                 and mutual understanding and to address difficult environmental and social issues
                                 over the medium term we believe that conducting constructive dialogue best serves
                                 the transformation to a more sustainable future

                                in 2013 we examined the textile industry in great detail following the rana plaza factory

                                have appropriate policies in place have made commitments and support relevant

                                implemented to understand the reasons behind this we initiated discussions with
                                specific clients in this sector the lessons we drew from this dialogue will inform our

                                      as a responsible investor we believe that the integration of esg into our investment

                                       processes and the introduction of new technologies or systems but also requires all
                                        employees to be open to new ways of thinking which will lead to new habits and a
                                        very different approach to daily work

                                       in the past we may have underestimated the potential emotional effects of change
                                       we have therefore developed a series of measures to support leaders and employees
                                       throughout the transformation these include guidelines on managing change surveys
                                       to assess how employees are processing the change both mentally and emotionally
                                       and coaching workshops and trainings on how to increase efficiency

                                 the committee is a formal body that steers and governs bankwide strategic talent
                                 practices it is chaired by our co ceos

                                senior appointments are centrally coordinated to ensure that the most qualified talent
                                from across the bank is quickly identified for critical open positions this is closely
                                linked to succession planning and supports crossdivisional mobility development

                                managing performance
                                differentiating performance and letting our employees know where they stand is
                                essential to rewarding them fairly and motivating them we review employees
                                performance based on both what they have achieved performance objectives and
                                 how they have achieved this values and beliefs

                                employees typically have two formal reviews with their direct manager each year 
                                a midyear review and a yearend review supported by ongoing informal conversations
                                throughout the year these formal reviews present a coaching and feedback opportunity
                                to discuss performance and develop employees career goals performance evaluations
                                conducted by managers also inform compensation and promotion decisions we
                                support employees in reaching higher levels of performance by developing new skills
                                and capabilities through appropriate training and development programs

                                in 2013 more than 95 of employees in scope completed a performance review using
                                the banks system for supporting employee performance and development

                                aligning compensation with sustainable performance
                                public perceptions of compensation in the banking sector were generally very critical
                                in the wake of the financial crisis redesigning our compensation and benefit schemes
                                is therefore important to our strategic employee initiatives

                                in 2012 we commissioned an independent compensation review panel to assess
                                management compensation practices at deutsche bank the panels review included
                                benchmarking the banks compensation systems against industry best practice as
                                well as current and expected regulatory requirements the panels findings published
                                in 2013 noted that governance processes around the banks compensation structure
                                decisionmaking and related disclosures are of a high standard the panel went on to
                                state that such processes should still however be evaluated regularly we are in full

  dbcomcrcompensation       in 2013

                                in accordance with local data protection and labor laws we initiated a process to
                                compile a list of all employees currently excluding nonmanagerial staff in germany
                                who had received a disciplinary sanction during the year the information collected
                                as well as the examination of the general context are considered when deciding on
                                individual compensation we also include data from our red flags initiative in this

                                although the management board and the group executive committee currently
                                have no female members we are committed to increasing diversity within these
                                bodies we are therefore building a pipeline of senior talent to ensure better female
                                representation in our senior succession planning

                                this year the third cohort of women took part in the awardwinning atlas

passion for the planet
beyond our efforts in ecoefficiency for our operations we
provide our employees with opportunities to participate in
volunteering activities that address environmental issues

 in hong kong for example employees work with a
 local ngo on the ecopaddy program which promotes
traditional rice farming to help conserve agricultural
 wetland  a natural habitat for several endangered
 species deutsche bank employees and their families
  help with farming activities and learn about ecopaddy
  farming and conservation

in germany more than 3400 employees have volunteered
with trinkwasserwald an organization that promotes
diversity in forests to protect drinking water sources

in the past four years they have planted a total of
45000 trees to provide an additional 12 million liters of                                                   employees increase

              we calculate this adjusted measure of our return on average shareholders equity to make it easier to compare us to our
              competitors we refer to this adjusted measure as our pretax return on average active equity however this is not
              a measure of performance under ifrs and you should not compare our ratio based on average active equity to other
              companies ratios without considering the differences in the calculation of the ratio the items for which we adjust the
              average shareholders equity of 561 billion for 2013 and 556 billion for 2012 are average dividends of 646 million in
              2013 and 670 million in 2012 for which a proposal is accrued on a quarterly basis and which are paid after the approval
              by the annual general meeting following each year
