    strengthen our crisis response capability we learned      we will promptly provide optimal solutions to the
    a great deal from the drill about how to put information   various issues faced by our customers and society
    in order and grasp it systematically in the midst of       at large this is our greatest mission we recognize
    confusion and what actions to give priority when          the importance of earning the trust of our customers

    the exclusion zone designated around the nuclear           society that as i see it is what csr means
    power plant this has delayed the supply of a portion
    of our products i would like to express our profound       how would you assess the csr initiatives that
    apologies to the customers who were severely                    you have been promoting up to this point
    inconvenienced as a result we will deal seriously         the hitachi chemical group recognized very early
    with these experiences take steps to review and           that csr is a cornerstone of management we

           fusing business strategy and csr together             are taking to promote sustainable business
     first all of our employees need to understand that    in promoting sustainable business i think it is
     sustained growth cannot be achieved unless we do       crucial that we heighten the awareness of those
     business based on csr then with that i want to      with responsibility for the operating divisions
     build a system that allows them to take action by      where product strategies and monozukuri product
     themselves                                            design manufacturing and improvement up to
          for the stage 1 we established a csr policy      now have centered on product functionality and
     composed of eight items and promoted that for         costs therefore we have added the perspective of
     the stage 2 however we will aim to heighten          sustainability and made that a new standard for
     employee understanding of csr activities and to       evaluation specifically we are going to set the
     deploy activities that are more effective we have     implementation       objectives   for     sustainable
     refashioned the policy into three major guidelines    engineering as key performance indicators kpi in
     which are business stance corporate stance and       every operating division starting in fiscal 2011 and
     individual stance in the stage 2 we will promote     continuing to fiscal 2015 we are going to follow the

 worked together to improve overall csr performance by formulating action
plans every fiscal year based on the group csr policy and implementing the

      however incidents of misconduct accidents and the existence of
         a gap between our csr activities and our business activities
                 was observed including insufficient quantitative
                 evaluation of csrrelated activities and a lack of

among matters important to our business we heard that employees want us to
formulate more concrete measures in areas including overseas strategies new
products and technologies and the environment and we were requested to provide

  i realized the importance of considering things with a view to the future
  the town meeting gave us an opportunity to listen directly to one of our executives which we
  wouldnt ordinarily have had and the qa session produced a sense of fellowfeeling between
  us the meeting also made me aware that my understanding of hitachi chemicals vision had
  been quite inadequate up to that point sales and marketing activities are the face that a company
  presents to its customers i think that both the direction of sales and marketing and the response
  to the customer change depending on whether or not there is an awareness of the companys                                kota asano

 the social contribution experience program creating
 opportunities for employees to contribute
the hitachi chemical group held the first social contribution experience program event in
december 2010 focusing on realizing a deeper understanding of social contribution
activities and making it easier to participate in them this project offers employees an
experience of social contribution




                                                                                                                                                                                             responsibility to employees
     the first theme to be taken up was what we can do right nowunderstanding                                             lecture by mr shimagaki
retinitis pigmentosa and i had the chair 56 employees participated in the event including
some participating by teleconferencing the participants received lectures from the
instructor wore goggles that impaired their vision in order to experience what this condition
was like and gained experience of assisting visually impaired people


 i want to give something back to everyone in the
 company based on my experience
i was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa while i was a member of marketing and sales
                                                                                                                            wearing visual impairment goggles
operations after developing the condition i was able to do job training from home and take
up employment again having had this experience after i recommenced employment i




                                                                                                                                                                                             in the community
constantly had the feeling that i would like to use my experience and find some way that it
would be possible for me to give something back to everyone in the company
    in the first event of the program i was able to communicate my own experience and
the participants also gained a deeper understanding by actually experiencing visual
impairment hitachi chemical intends to continue the social contribution experience
program focusing on a wide variety of different topics by means of this program the
company is seeking to deepen understanding of various situations and conditions and to
encourage each individual employee to actively take part in social contribution activities                                 lecture on methods of assisting visually impaired people


 what is retinitis pigmentosa
 retinitis pigmentosa is a condition that causes night blindness and is designated as a specified disease intractable disease at present there is no method of treatment
 around 50 of cases are said to be hereditary and the condition is the thirdmost prevalent cause of visual impairment
                                                                                                                                                                                             for the global environment




   i was made aware once again of the importance of thinking from the
   perspective of the visually impaired
   i really learned a lot from participating in the first social contribution experience program event
   having mr shimagaki who suffers from retinitis pigmentosa talk to us directly about visual
   impairment and how to assist the visually impaired up to that day i had only imagined what visual
   impairment could be like but wearing the visual impairment goggles made me aware of the reality
   and i understood the importance of acting with an awareness of the perspective of the visually                                   miwako tohyama
   impaired i want to put this experience to use in the future and i hope that the company will make                              electronic materials sales dept

   more opportunities like this available in the future

     the hitachi chemical group target based on the kyoto protocol                                   and assessing energysaving methods
     and other such targets is to lower co2 emissions to 93 of the

     achieved the target of a recycling rate raised to 90 or better by
     fiscal 2010
           the hitachi chemical group has been engaged in a zero
     emissions initiative at sites in japan in order to reduce landfill
     waste we achieved zero emissions at all sites in fiscal 2006
     and have maintained that level of achievement in fiscal 2010
     our landfill waste figure on a consolidated basis in japan was
     154 tons
           going forward we intend to make use of material flow cost
     accounting mfca and work closely with our business activities
     to further reduce the amount of waste

reduce the losses however we were unable to identify the overall loss of the whole process or to
pinpoint the largest loss because the various indicators are in different units according to whether the
quantities are of weight or area and so on under the guidance of professor michiyasu nakajima and
associate professor asako kimura of kansai university therefore we adopted material flow cost
accounting mfca and tackled the challenge of making material losses visible



  making material losses visible through mfca
first we formed a promotion team made up not only of people from manufacturing divisions but also




                                                                                                                                                                                in the community
people responsible for production technology and environmental safety they broke down each
process into detailed work units and defined them as quantity centers they measured the weights of                                 mfca guidance meeting in session
materials input into each quantity center of intermediate goods handed on to the next quantity center
and of every loss discharged from the quantity centers then linked the inputs into the whole process
to the outputs next they linked each individual material to a unit price of procurement and quantified
the weights and money amounts of losses generated by each quantity center this clearly revealed the
items that need to be addressed in environmental terms and in economic terms making it possible to
assign priority rankings to measures taken which further contributed to reduction of the amount of
waste reduction of the cost of material procurement and improvement of manufacturing processes


  loss reduction through mfca adoption is a first step in developing
                                                                                                                                                                                for the global environment




  monozukuri into csr management
  mfca is scheduled to be published as iso 14051 in fiscal 2011 as an environmental
  management information tool that will be a focus of world attention it evaluates whether or not
  monozukuri in the manufacturing process simultaneously achieves environmental protection and
  increased profitability from the perspective of resource productivity its purpose is to thoroughly
  reduce the waste of resources negative products in adopting mfca here we made issues from
  environmental management visible and worked to reduce negative products i think this is a solid

                                                                             is being introduced as well which will track the flow of raw

                                                                             materials from stocking to product shipment in terms of
the corporation and of society and has changed the title of
this report accordingly to the sustainability report the main               physical quantities and financial amounts and which will
reason for noting this is that the hitachi chemical group has                eventually streamline its operations measures to make csr
clearly repositioned csr as a strategic driver of business                  activities visible in this way will without doubt attract attention
to the best of my knowledge no other corporation has so                     as best practices for the industry
explicitly identified csr as a strategic driver and formulated
its action programs                                                               although i have cited four points for positive evaluation
      second a frank and comprehensive summary is given                     above it is likely however paradoxical that what the hitachi
over the status of csr mediumterm roadmap stage 1                         chemical group will need to pay attention to is how to promote
overall stage 1 measures have made clear improvements                      other csr activities that it cannot formulate as business
yet the hitachi chemical group has also frankly                             strategies in a similar scheme if everything can be converted
acknowledged some points that it had not yet achieved for                   into terms of strategy then this problem will not arise that
example it is reported that prevention of industrial accidents              however is virtually impossible particularly activities that make
and compliance have not been carried through completely                     contributions to society are difficult to make into strategies and
and it is also suggested that an especially significant matter               considerable ingenuity will be required to include them in the
for reflection is the inability to link business activities and csr          same scheme as environmental technology and other such
activities together i rate this kind of summary highly because              matters if measures were taken first and foremost to address
no improvement of any kind is possible unless problems are                   only those activities that can be made into strategies then
faced directly                                                              whatever would not fit into those schemes might eventually
      third the csr mediumterm roadmap stage 2 has
                                                                             be ignored completely
been formulated carefully taking into account the matters for
                                                                                   to point out this problem however is not to throw cold
reflection the objectives of the csr mediumterm roadmap
                                                                             water on the hitachi chemical groups endeavors many

                                                                             corporations still tend to consider csr as nothing more
hitachi chemical group evolve into a corporate group that
                                                                             than another cost in order for industry to break out of this
is competitive throughout the world specific policies are
written systematically at the business level the company                    state the hitachi chemical group should proceed without
level and individual levels at the business level for example            hesitation to actively promote its csr strategy and produce
emphasis is placed on sustainable business that contributes                  substantial results in doing so if they remain firmly aware that
to the global community out of all the measures of the most                some activities that cannot be made into strategies will be
importance is innovation in business                                      left over then that will be more than sufficient under present
      this measure is an action program whereby each                         circumstances i hope with all my heart that the hitachi
division pursues selfreform so that it can contribute to the                chemical group will make this challenge a great success
