 as part of celebrating our 160th anniversary in 2013 we implemented a thorough
 review of our accomplishments to see what lessons we could learn perhaps the
 biggest revelation was the extent to which ihi has played a significant role by offering
 innovative products including many that were either the first of their kind in japan or
 the largest of their kind in the world clearly ihi has contributed tirelessly to progress
 through technology which remains our business philosophy to this day


 over the years ihi has grown in close harmony with society and now together with
 society we are faced with serious challenges to humankind and the environment
 including resource depletion urbanization climate change natural disasters and more


 in response ihi is leveraging its signature precisionmanufacturing monozukuri
 technological expertise not only to enhance corporate value but also to meet the
 expectations of society in particular through our businesses ihi group is addressing
 vital needs to reduce environmental damage provide stable supplies of energy lower
 the risks associated with industrialization and urbanization and improve access to medical care food and water


 our current business plan emphasizes what we call the three links each of which has strong csr overtones 1 linkage
 among existing businesses 2 linkage between productsservices and between information and communication technologies
 and 3 linkage among ihi businesses customers and partners worldwide these strategic links enable us to apply significant
 resources and capacities not only seamlessly but also in unique and innovate ways to help solve global challenges


 the csr mindsetan essential element of our companyis integrated with all ihi business activities by linking regions
 information and products as systems we are using diverse sources from throughout our value chain to create more value for
 customers investors and employees and ultimately for society as a whole at the same time we are strengthening our base
 for stable longterm growth


 csr begins with employees our single largest asset all employees regardless of position are encouraged to go to actual
 sites grasp whats actually going on and determine what actually needs to be done both for the customer and for society
 also the company is striving to expand its diversity and create working environments that allow everyone to achieve their full
 potential great trust is placed in our employees worldwide we actively delegate authority to senior managers and help them
 to develop ihis businesses in a way that best fits the local context while global partners are afforded appropriate flexibility

 they also are requested to follow ihis lead in exercising proper governance at all times

  message
 we believe that a stable supply of environmentally friendly energy is what society
 expects from the ihi groups resources energy and environment business to
 meet these expectations we offer an optimum combination of powergeneration
 technologies applied to a diverse range of fuels for example we provide
 distributed power systems such as ecofriendly gas turbines and gas engines to
 emerging countries where the capacity of power transmission lines is limited to
 some extent when we build a large power station we will provide and export not
 only the plant itself but also operational services including wellestablished
 maintenance technology we will contribute to the energy supply in a way suitable
 to the actual needs of the region


                                         at the same time we also continue to develop technologies for reducing environmental
                                         impacts carbon capture and storage ccs is a process to capture and store carbon
                                         dioxide co2 generated by power stations the ihi group has developed oxyfuel

                                         combustion technology a revolutionary process for capturing co2 and has started

                                         demonstration tests in australia a demonstration plant is under construction in
                                         indonesia of a twin ihi gasifier tigar which uses lignite a lowgrade coal that has
                                         not been effectively utilized to date as a raw material when these technologies reach
                                         commercialization they will help to reduce the impact that power generation has on
                                         climate change as well as to greatly reform energy andor power portfolio

  message
 the ihi group has played an active role in the aviation industry since the mid
 1950s building a reputation for supplying environmentally friendly aircraft engines
 with safety first in mind thanks to the evolution of engine technology we have
 reduced fuel consumption by as much as 70 over the last 40 years


 passenger air travel is expected to increase at an average annual rate of about
 5 and at the same time the demand for increasingly green aircraft engines will
 rise to meet this demand and thereby reduce co2 emissions we are working to

 improve fuel efficiency by developing new engines and algae biofuel a possible
 substitute for jet fuel


 in spacerelated activities in addition to collaborating with other countries in space exploration we are also trying to expand
 the fields in which artificial satellites may be used to help preserve the global environment and promote human activities


 for instance by launching satellites with various sensors into space to monitor how much co2 is being released into the

 atmosphere the status of forests and the floodrisk potential of rivers such information could contribute immeasurably to
 our global environmental infrastructure or it could be used to monitor specific areas of earth to help prevent accidents and
 disasters ihi is planning to utilize the epsilon launch vehicle see fy2013 activities for such spacerelated activities in the
 near future


 our aero engine space and defense business is unique in that these fields require exceptionally long periods of time for
 research development and commercialization for example in a joint project with a materials manufacturer it took us nearly
 20 years to develop a form of carbon fiber as an advanced composite material for lightweight engines the product life cycle
 of a jet engine is even longerroughly 30 years in other words we must always look ahead several decades




ihi csr report 2014                                                                                                                  17

 the issues affecting us our society and the global community are constantly changing so it is critical for us to continuously
 address and manage changes in our business the two most valuable assets of the ihi group are its monozukuri practice
 namely technology with high productivity and quality and its human resources both of which form the foundation of our
 capability to deal with change we are confident that we will achieve growth by drawing upon these strengths




  our objective

                 we provide safe convenient and environmentally friendly air
             transportation systems and also develop and use space technology
                                for sustainable development

  basic policies
 ihi defines corporate governance as a system designed to maximize corporate value by increasing management efficiency
 and leveraging the companys capabilities to the fullest extent possible to attain this ihi introduced the executive officer
 system to clearly separate management oversight functions from functions related to the daytoday operations of the
 business thus enabling effective and appropriate decisionmaking by building a corporate governance system that
 administers and monitors all related rules and regulations the group is able to ensure that strategies directions and
 instructions from management are carried out systematically and effectively across the entire group




  corporate governance system
 ihi which is classified in japan as a company with audit  supervisory board elects five corporate auditors three of
 whom are outside corporate auditors the board of directors which consists of fifteen directors two of whom are outside
 directors makes decisions related to all important matters concerning the management of the group in addition to
 overseeing directors in the execution of their duties

 directors participate in the board of directors decisionmaking process they offer advice and make recommendations
 independently of the managers whom are delegated the authority to handle daytoday operations


 ihi introduced the executive officer system to facilitate and strengthen the decisionmaking and supervisory functions of the
 board of directors as well as to improve the efficiency of business operations appointed by board of directors resolution
 executive officers execute the duties delegated to them under the ceos guidance and supervision


 to ensure propriety in director remuneration the ihi group established the compensation advisory committee that consists
 of four members an outside director who acts as committee chairman an outside corporate auditor a board member
 responsible for human resources and a board member responsible for finance

  conflict of interest
 if a conflict of interest arises between a business transaction and a director or executive officer we require the board of
 directors to pass a resolution or take other action as stipulated by law to avoid said conflict

ihi csr report 2014                                                                                                              26

  internal control system
 basic policy for establishment of internal control system is designed to raise the effectiveness of corporate governance and
 increase the corporate value of the group these policies provide a framework for achieving a sound compliance structure
 and enhanced riskmanagement systems ihi believes that establishing a robust internal control system is key to expanding
 business globally as well as maintaining and operating management systems that are shared throughout the group


 in response to cases of accounting improprieties japan instituted an internal control reporting system jsox based on the
 financial instruments and exchange act jsox mandates the implementation and operation of internal controls in the
 preparation and disclosure of financial statements as well as the submission of a report evaluating the effectiveness of such
 controls an evaluation of the groups internal controls for fy2013 found no material weaknesses


 the corporate audit division is responsible for strengthening and optimizing the internal management systems of executive
 divisions from a monitoring perspective the corporate audit division raises the competitiveness of group companies and
 establishes a foundation for improving corporate value


  ihi group internal control system




  project control system
 we established a project audit division to ensure that large projects such as construction projects subject to the
 percentage of completion method are properly evaluated during implementation specific subjects include project
 management status and riskassessment criteria and the proper and transparent calculation of a projects estimated
 profitability


 during fy2013 ended march 31 2014 66 group construction projects were audited sales of audited projects accounted for
 about 13 of consolidated sales large projects undertaken either in japan or overseas are audited with consideration for the
 following
 adequacy of the projects execution system and execution plan after the order is received

ihi csr report 2014                                                                                                               27

 appropriateness of total construction cost estimated final cost at completion of the project
   relative to the projects progress
 transparency appropriateness and timeliness of the projects estimated profitability


 when generating estimates for large projects ihi implements a screening process related to project execution risk to verify
 project execution systems the validity of the execution plan and the profitability of the project


 to ensure both adequacy and timely rectification we will continue to conduct audits and risk assessments of construction
 projects including local assessments as well as strive to further enhance our auditing quality each departments activities
 will be independently audited and evaluated and the results will be communicated the department will be notified prior to the
 audit regarding the items to be reviewed and upon completion of the audit the results will be communicated throughout the
 group the results may be used as case studies for training purposes

 note

 for large construction projects that span more than one accounting period revenue is recognized not after construction is completed but instead

 is recorded as a peryear amount in line with the progress of work




   in the previous fiscal year the project audit division began auditing projects according to their levels eg characteristics
   or execution conditions in fy2013 the contents and highlights of audits which are published within the ihi group were
   further subdivided according to their levels and were enhanced with more detailed descriptions


   case studies written and developed from audit results which were communicated horizontally across the ihi group were
   updated to reflect survey responses from relevant divisions and to make the objectives of the case studies easier to
   grasp


   when generating estimates for large projects evaluation items and criteria that improved the comprehensiveness and
   objectivity of screening were adopted


   through these efforts we are maintaining audit quality while working to streamline the project audit process and ensure
   that an understanding of project management is shared within the group
   such efforts will ensure that audit quality is maintained as the audit process is streamlined and that project management
   methodology is shared throughout the group

  ensuring the safety of products
 the ihi group is constantly working to enhance the safety of its products during product development we conduct risk
 assessments by considering each products usage and life cycle as well as by designing measures to reduce risk and
 providing customers with information on any residual risk when designs are altered we conduct risk assessments of the
 changes including the extent of the impact on products
 since comprehensive safety verification records do not always exist for products with long histories we review risk
 assessments of frequently used products such as mechanical parking systems to confirm external trends and technological
 advances that are reflected in newer versions of such products the assessments are performed by design and technical
 teams working with maintenance personnel who are in close contact with the users we revise and update user manuals and
 warning labels based on the assessments and users expectations we are always thinking about customer safety and
 working to ensure that our products are used safely
 in fy2013 we reviewed multistory parking systems found typically in condominiums and made certain appropriate changes
 these efforts were shared with the groups quality committee to facilitate application to other products and models as
 required
 in fy2013 there was no serious accident involving any product

 to ensure that this policy has been conveyed properly we requested major business partners
 in japan to participate in a survey about how the policy is being implemented by some 2000
 suppliers the survey showed that some suppliers were finding it difficult to adhere to the
 policy which prompted us to devise measures to help these companies to implement
 improvements
 with respect to markets outside japan our key task for fy2014 is to achieve a better
 understanding of the laws and regulations tax systems and social conditions of countries
 where we have operations as our business grows globally our overseas procurement of materials is on the rise we assume
 that we can procure more than 30 of materials from local suppliers in some projects for this reason we plan to increase
 the number of procurement personnel we have overseas and train them in local laws and regulations not only will this
 strengthen corporate social responsibility in our procurements it will enable us to contribute more to local development in
 markets overseas
 to address procurementrelated issues regarding for example the environment or conflict minerals our procurement
 personnel must understand the issues correctly and thoroughly and be able to communicate effectively with all parties
 concerned we work tirelessly to ensure that these needs are communicated to employees and shared with business
 partners helping thereby to strengthen relationships with our partners

 initiatives on an ongoing basis

    environmental action
message from general manager
corporate social responsibility division

  ever improving our environmentally friendly efforts
 the impact of climate change is becoming more evident and environmental issues are
 becoming more pressing it is clear that there is no time to waste to improve the situation
 the ihi groups business activities which span infrastructure energy and industrial systems
 often affect the global environment so we have an opportunity to reduce the impact of such
 activities at the same time our business partners can contribute to this effort by utilizing
 ecofriendly ihi products tackling and resolving environmental problems is not only a serious
 responsibility it also creates growth opportunities that have great significance for our group
 based on a company decision to adopt a more environmentally friendly approach in fy2013
 we formulated the ihi group environmental vision 2013 which is tied directly to our business
 plans the vision spells out the environmental actions we will follow up to fy2018 centering on the themes of reducing
 environmental burdens through productsservices reducing environmental burdens through business operations and
 promoting group environmental management
 currently our focus is on laying the groundwork to achieve our vision this includes defining our environmentally friendly
 products and introducing evaluation indicators namely co2 emissions reduction contribution levels to raise the visibility of

 our efforts to reduce environmental burdens we have identified environmental initiatives for each operational process
 including research and development procurement and manufacturing
 we recognize the vital need to manage the ihi group in an environmentally friendly manner so we have started collecting
 data on our environmental burdens and operations both domestic and overseas including consolidated ihi group companies
 in 2013 we visited eight of our overseas business sites to strengthen communications with local environment personnel
 whats especially important now is to develop an organizational culture in which each employee thinks independently about
 how their work affects the environment and what they can do and then takes action we will further enhance such employee
 awareness so that we can meet societys expectations by doing whatever it takes to ensure we are solutions oriented




ihi csr report 2014                                                                                                               61

    environmental action
activities in fy2013

  special feature 1 initiatives at our soma works
 ihis soma works located in fukushima prefecture of the tohoku region is a stateoftheart plant that manufactures jet
 engine parts for aircraft worldwide in anticipation of a rise in annual output of engine parts due to increasing global demand
 for aircraft we have made a range of improvements to the plant based on lessons learned from the great east japan
 earthquake
 to accommodate increased power demand in the summer we installed a 11megawatt solar power system and 25kilowatt
 hour lithiumion batteries for enhanced business continuity planning in fy2012 additionally we installed a large 28
 megawatthour lithiumion battery storage system in fy2013 the system allows us to store power at night when the plant
 operates below full capacity and then use that power together with solar power generated during the day to cover about 10
 of the energy used during peak hours to raise energysaving awareness a monitor is provided to show visitors and
 employees how much power is generated and used at the plant




 power generated by the solar system is not sold back to the grid but instead is fully consumed at the soma works this
 power used in conjunction with the lithiumion battery storage system has three major benefits firstly the plant is raising
 its production output without raising the amount of electricity it purchases this is because the battery storage system
 enables peak shaving or supplementing power needs at peak hours with battery power and peak shifting or leveraging
 consumption by charging and discharging batteries at preset hours
 the second benefit is to leverage the highest power consumption during the day as required by the revised act on the
 rational use of energy thirdly even if power supply is disrupted by an emergency or disaster the plant can still use solar
 power and the small lithiumion batteries to power lights air conditioning computers and communication equipment at its
 emergency headquarters

 our soma works which survived the great east japan earthquake not only aims to become the worlds numberone aircraft
 engine parts manufacturing plant but it also aims to support the people of fukushima prefecture by continuing to reduce its
 co2 emissions and implement other environmentally friendly operations



  special feature 2 visits to exjapan affiliates
 the list of companies included in ihis environmental data was expanded to encompass consolidated ihi group companies
 including exjapan affiliates in fy2013 among the many ihi group affiliates operating worldwide eight major companies in
 europe southeast asia and china were selected for visits by environmental officers from ihis corporate social
 responsibility division the officers met their overseas counterparts to exchange information and discuss the environmental
 action being taken locally
 at one such company a vehicular turbocharger massproduction plant in europe automated production lines are operated
 with picking robots making this a highly automated and highly efficient production facility strict waste control is ensured by
 displaying widely used european waste catalog codes at wastedisposal sites and on wastedisposal containers the plant
 also makes its environmental impact data available online and offers a system for compiling the data in graphs overall the
 plant fully complies with environmental regulations and monitors its environmental impact data very closely




ihi csr report 2014                                                                                                                 63

 production activities the affiliate in china has been certified under
 iso14001 for its environmental management systems helping to raise
 environmental awareness among employees both companies demonstrate
 how ihi adopts environmental approaches appropriate to each region to
 respond to the needs of its host communities

                                                        about energysaving methods practiced in japan
                                                        we share environmental best practices of our domestic and exjapan

  our environmental vision
 where do we wish to be once our ihi group environmental vision 2013 lasting through fy2018 has been fully implemented
 described below is what the ihi group plans to accomplish by lowering the environmental burdens of its productsservices
 and business operations and by carrying out group environmental management


  reduction of environmental burdens through productsservices
 limit co2 emissions from ihi group operations up to approximately 300000 tons per year cut back emissions through

   productsservices worldwide down by 10 million tonsyear
 the amount of reduction of co2 emissions through products and services is stipulated in the management targets for

   business divisions and sectors
 maintain sales ratio of ecofriendly products in entire ihi group at over 70
 customers and employees recognize that using ihi products and services is equivalent to protecting the global environment
 ihi products win awards for contributing to global environmental preservation


  reduction of environmental burdens through business operations
 publicize and achieve the co2 emissionsreduction target for the entire group business operations

 no waste of electricity and fuels as energy savings activities are spread across production sitesoffices
 promote green procurement to prioritize ecoconscious suppliers
 chemical substances in products are stringently managed to further gain customer trust
 protecting biodiversity becomes a larger part of our business


  promoting group environmental management
 domestic and exjapan production sites share items on environmental burdens and reduction targets
 main domestic and exjapan production sites introduce environmental management systems and improve environmental
   management continuously
 establish a system for sharing information on tightening environmental lawsregulations from a global perspective
 establish a system of internal environmental audits to monitor issues and take action as soon as any problem occurs
 provide information on the status of environmental activities via inhouse journals intranet etc




  image of the environmental vision to be achieved
 the ihi group aiming to build sustainable societies to protect our planet is helping to reduce environmental burdens in five
 business areas which were newly defined when the groups environmental vision was introduced aero engine and space
 industrial system and generalpurpose machinery life science food and water social infrastructure and offshore
 facilities and resources energy and environment but the ihi group cannot achieve such goals alone so it is working
 closely with its customers and business partners worldwide
 the ihi group also takes human resources development seriously wishing for everyone in the group to be environmentally
 aware in their respective operations as professionals with high technological capabilities and monozukuri precision
 manufacturing skills

  action to achieve environmental vision
 to achieve our environmental vision we have identified the following environmental challenges aimed at reducing
 environmental burdens through our productsservices and operations
 1measures to save energy and limit climate change
 2measures to establish recycleoriented societies
 3measures to protect the environment
 chemical substances and environmental risks
 biodiversity
 the ihi groups business activities can be classified into nine basic operational processes management sales rd design
 procurement manufacturing transportation construction and testing the resulting products and services are then
 classified into three stages usage maintenance and disposal
 the following table describes the specific actions needed to take in our respective operational processes and
 productservice stages as we work to raise the environmental awareness of our employees

    environmental action
environmental management

  companies included in our environmental data
 based on changes to ihis organizational structure from fy2013 the scope of companies included in the groups
 environmental data was expanded from ihi regions and work sites and ihi marine united which had been effective up to
 fy2012 to consolidated ihi group companies including exjapan affiliates japan marine united corporation formerly
 known as ihi marine united is no longer included
 in fy2013 the first year of the ihi group environmental action plan 2013 our environmental activities reflected this
 broadened scope
 please note that the fy2013 data shown in this chapter was still under review as of june 30 2014 and may vary by up to
 10 according to changes based future calculations and scope
 the conversion factor of 0418 kilograms of co2 per kilowatt is used to calculate co2 equivalents as electricity




  how we performed in fy2013
 the ihi group formulates a new environmental action plan every three years in fy2013 we launched the ihi group
 environmental action plan 2013 which is centered around the following three core strategies
 strengthen group environmental management
 reduce environmental burdens through products and services
 reduce environmental burdens through business operations
 related initiatives were focused on five key challenges as shown in the table in internal audits conducted during the year
 we graded our efforts on a scale of 1 to 4 and achieved overall scores of 80 or higher implementation of green
 procurements however received a score of 2 due to the fact that the green procurement activities of ihi group suppliers
 had been examined but ihi had not yet established new rules for green procurements
 based on our assessments of performance in fy2013 we have made implementation of green procurements our newest
 priority challenge for fy2014 going forward we will continue to upgrade our foundation for managing the ihi group in the
 most environmentally friendly manner possible

  how we tackled our toppriority agenda
 described below are the measures we took in fy2013 to tackle both our toppriority agenda and measures planned for future
 implementation


 1 established groupwide environmental management system
 we expanded the companies included in our environmental data to include consolidated ihi group companies we collected
 and compiled past data on major categories of environmental burden and used it to build a database we have begun our
 discussion on targets for impact reduction and will manage related data on a consistent basis to make our business more
 environmentally friendly
 also we assessed how well our major exjapan business sites are progressing with their environmental initiatives based on
 which we have begun to strengthen communications with environmental personnel at exjapan offices as required


 2 further quantitative reduction of co2 emissions

 as part of our efforts to help reduce co2 emissions and other greenhouse gases we calculated the amounts of co2

 emissions associated with major ihi groups products based on these calculations we are now expanding our range of
 products capable of contributing to co2 emissions reduction

ihi csr report 2014                                                                                                            71

 3expanded ecofriendly and ecoprotection products
 we use a system of six icons to indicate the environmental performance of our products in fy2013 we displayed many of
 our top performers at the eco product exhibition showcasing our commitment to providing society with ecofriendly and
 ecoprotection products going forward we plan to introduce an inhouse certification scheme to accurately identify ihi
 groups products that are particularly greenoriented


 4 promote energy conservation and climatechange prevention
 ihi makes every effort to reduce energy consumption in its operations in addition to reduce co2 emissions company

 worksites and offices use equipment efficiently and upgrade to more energyefficient equipment as required this year we
 will set new co2 emissions reduction targets according to the new list of companies covered in environmental data which

 was reviewed in the previous fiscal year to further our effort for reducing co2 emissions


 5management of information about chemical substances in products
 during the reporting year we assisted ihi group companies in developing and strengthening their systems for managing
 chemical substances in fy2014 we will continue with efforts to strengthen the management of chemical substances in the
 ihi group




  external recognition of ihi group environmental efforts
 ihi group actively participates in environmental action surveys in fy2013 we took part in the nikkei environmental
 management survey and the cdp formerly known as carbon disclosure project a number of ihi group activities have been
 recognized and praised for their environmental benefits



  nikkei environmental management survey
 nikkei inc conducts an annual survey of japans leading companies to evaluate their environmental initiatives and
 management efficiency evaluations cover five categories environmentally friendly management pollution and biodiversity
 resource recycling products and global warming the respondents are scored in each category using a 100point scale with
 a top overall score of 500
 in fy2013 ihi group scored strongly in environmentally friendly management resulting in a big jump in rankings from the
 previous year
 survey results
 fy2012 score 347 out of 500 ranking 259th out of 429 manufacturers
 
 fy2013 score 403 out of 500 ranking 123th out of 438 manufacturers

  cdp
 formerly known as the carbon disclosure project cdp is a nonprofit organization that was established by investors
 worldwide every year it discloses the results of questionnaires sent to corporations and local governments to urge more
 action in fighting climate change the cdp index measuring such efforts is relied upon by institutional investors worldwide
 in fy2013 in accordance with our new ihi group environmental vision we decided to make our environmental action data
 available to the public which resulted in our receiving a higher disclosure score than before and moved our overall
 performance rating up to b

  environmental management systems
 ihis environmental committee chaired by the officer in charge of environmental activities formulates groupwide policies
 for environmental activities and then evaluates and follows up on resulting activities the policies and related decisions are
 shared with principal domestic and exjapan affiliates through the business division and sectors environmental officers
 liaison group
 in addition environmental officers liaison groups help to facilitate environmental activities at each regional office and
 worksite
 also each business division and sector decides on an environmental activity plan at the beginning of every fiscal year
 typical themes include investment in environmental facilities legal and regulatory compliance and activities to reduce
 environmental burden such as energysaving and wastereduction measures each unit follows up on its own progress by
 implementing the pdca cycle

    environmental action
reducing environmental burdens in business
operations

  materials usage
 ihi group is working to lower its environmental burdens by reducing the amount of materials input and output by its
 businesses the scope of materials usage in ihi business in fy2013 is described hereafter




  reduction of co2 emissions during production
 extreme weather and rising sea levels seen around the world in recent years are thought to be caused by global warming the
 ihi group is taking action to reduce co2 emissions one of the prime suspects behind global warming

 the amount of co2 emitted by ihi has been decreasing since 2009 thanks to tireless efforts the graph below shows the

 standard unit of measurement which is calculated by dividing the ihi groups total co2 emissions by consolidated sales

 compared to the peak in 2010 the amount was slashed by about 27 in 2013
 co2 emitted annually by the ihi group remained at about 250000 tons between fy2009 and fy2013 emissions decreased

 slightly between fy2010 and fy2012 but rose in fy2013 the breakdown by group sales is shown the graph in fy2013 co2

 emissions were about 8 below the fy2010 level when they peaked during the plotted fiveyear period
 for fy2014 we have set our new co2 emissionsreduction targets in accordance with the expanded list of companies

 including in our current environmental data going forward we will endeavor to reduce co2 emissions in our production

 activities through energysaving operations and upgraded equipment

  reduction of energy consumption
 the ihi group reduces energy consumed in its business activities by implementing a wide range of energysaving measures
 including the efficient use of equipment at works and offices and upgrading to energyefficient equipment
 energysaving training by external experts has been organized at ihis major business sites since fy2009 in a typical year
 training is tailored to the requirements of each business unit is provided 24 times groupwide including 12 times at ihi
 offices and 12 times at group companies posttraining results are closely monitored to ensure successful implementation
 energy consumption by ihi has been decreasing since 2009 thanks to energysaving measures the graph below indicates the
 standard physical unit calculated by dividing the amount of ihis energy consumption by its consolidated sales compared to
 the standard physical unit peaked in 2010 ihi group succeeded in cutting back the amount by about 27 by 2013
 energy consumed annually by the ihi group was about 140000 kiloliters crude oil equivalent between fy2009 and fy2013
 consumption decreased slightly between fy2010 and fy2012 but rose in fy2013 figures are shown in the graph in fy2013
 consumption was about 9 below the fy2010 level when it peaked during the plotted fiveyear period
 we continue to reduce our energy consumption in production activities by ensuring the efficient use of equipment and
 upgrading other equipment as required

  energy consumed by ihi group




  reduction of energy consumption in distribution
 ihi is saving energy in its distribution operations with the aim of reducing consumption by at least 1 year to year over the
 medium to long term
 products shipped by ihi such as jet engine parts and commercial boilers vary so significantly in size weight and quantity
 that it is not possible to use a unified energyconsumption rate throughout the group instead we ensure that each worksite
 sets its own energy consumption targets and explores the most appropriate modes of transportation for shipments
 we also identify worksites that use large amounts of energy for distribution and then provide advice for improvements for
 each product weight transportation distance and mode energy consumption and standard physical unit and co2 emissions

 data are compiled on a monthly basis the data are then presented to the quarterly environment committee as reference for
 providing guidance
 information also is collected from logistics staff at worksites concerning modes of transportation used or the existence of
 any transportation restrictions to facilitate greater efficiency worksites share best practices regarding modal shifts to rail or
 ship truck loading efficiency and freight consolidation

  contribution to building a recycleoriented society
  improving waste management
 ihis regional offices pursue reduction reuse and recyclingthe 3 rs
 as well as appropriate disposal of industrial waste
 in fy2013 we commissioned amita corporation to analyze our waste
 management risks including how contracts management procedures
 and other documents are retained or disposed the findings were used
 to revise operational and management procedures for enhanced waste
 management
 in addition a recycling skillsenhancement seminar was provided for
 managers at the toyosu headquarters
 outside japan one representative companya vehicular turbocharger makerwas found to have been use returnable
 containers to receive parts from suppliers and deliver products to customers thereby substantially reducing the companys
 consumption of packing materials minimizing waste for the annual shipment of hundreds of thousands of turbochargers is one
 of many ways that ihi is helping to realize recycleoriented societies

  reduction of waste and water consumption
 as part of our efforts to conserve natural resources the ihi group is working to reduce its consumption of water resources
 and generation of businessrelated waste waste generation has declined but water consumption has trended upward in
 recent years as shown in the graphs

  management and disposal of electric equipment containing pcbs
 all ihi group companies properly manage electric equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in fy2009 we
 started to manage and dispose of equipment containing relatively large amounts of pcbs in a safe pollutionfree manner to
 date we have safely disposed of about 37 of all such equipment
 we have also have completed identification of fluorescent light stabilizers and electric equipment containing smaller amounts
 of pcbs which nevertheless will be disposed of and now are in the process of replacing them



  addressing soil contamination

 the ihi group launched a threeyear project in 2011 to examine data concerning officially designated hazardous substances
 oils and fats used on land mainly production sites owned by the group we completed our survey of 68 former and current
 production facilities in march 2013
 if contamination is discovered on land where building construction expansion or renovation is planned the land must be
 thoroughly examined and treated and relevant authorities must be notified in some cases this can raise costs in terms of
 time and money and even lead to termination of the project in some instances
 but by proactively conducting preliminary studies of possible contamination we can act sooner to forecast expected costs
 and take steps to minimize delays this is why we are continually updating such data every year
 we also use the findings from such studies to help minimize risks due to possible changes in the characteristics of
 contaminated soil


  25 substances listed in article 2 of japans soil contamination countermeasures act such as lead hexavalent chromium and mercury




  management of information on chemical substances in products
 the ihi group is developing a system to manage chemical substances used in its supply chain under the guidance of an
 external consultant from mizuho information  research institute inc we are working with ihi star machinery corporation
 which manufactures agricultural equipment
 we specifically request suppliers in our upstream supply chain not to use or add substances that are prohibited in the
 products they supply to us we have also set up review groups with the quality assurance division serving as the executive
 office to help monitor this process and ensure that information is shared between our departments for research 
 development production manufacturing sales planning and logistics activities are monitored and managed on a monthly
 basis and the results of eliminating prohibited substances are reported to customers in our downstream supply chain
 data obtained from initiatives carried out with ihi star machinery corporation are disseminated horizontally throughout the
 ihi group our tireless management of information on groupwide use of chemical substances is important not only for
 compliance with laws and regulations but also to ensure that we meet customer requirements
 the ihi group also monitors each worksites release of designated chemical substances into the atmosphere public waters
 soil etc or transfer of off premises this is done in accordance with the pollutant release and transfer register prtr
 and the government is notified accordingly

 green preserve to practical use in terms of protecting biodiversity
 it conducted an analysis of the surrounding ecosystem of which
 the green preserve is one part aiming to ascertain what roles the
 preserve serves now and what would be possible in the future from
 the perspective of biodiversity satellite imagery was used to
 evaluate the preserve and create a map to visualize how it
 connects with the surrounding area it was learned that it is part of
 a larger ecosystem that links woodland on one side and the sea on
 the other with the preserve forming the center of this natural
 network




 also a study of the worksite and neighboring area conducted in october revealed a range of animal species living in the
 preserve including tanuki raccoons kingfisher and pygmy woodpeckers stag beetles colias butterflies and much more the
 findings were identical to those of surveys conducted in the surrounding area

 as a result of the studies it was determined that the green
 preserve of the aichi worksite is helping to preserve biodiversity
 based on this conclusion the company devised a plan for
 environmental preservation and enhancement to support the
 surrounding ecosystem including to provide animals with
 sustainable natural habitats
