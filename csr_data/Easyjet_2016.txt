our objective is always to optimise our return on capital
employed through the allocation of aircraft and capacity across
the network regularly moving them to airports and routes with
better opportunities in february we closed our base at rome
fiumicino and redistributed the eight base aircraft to other
bases in italy including the opening of a new base in venice
every year we also churn routes that have not reached their
targeted objectives these actions reiterate our focus on
returns and will increase the return on capital employed of the
company as a whole as we have done regularly in the past
and will do so in the future
we continue to add frequencies and commit to basing aircraft
around the network in scale in 2016 we broadly maintained our
asset utilisation across the network at an average of just under

the yearonyear variance in average euro exchange rates for revenue and costs was principally due to the timing of revenue and
cost cash flows on average revenue cash inflows occur several months before cost cash outflows resulting in a change in euro
exchange rates impacting revenue later than costs the net adverse impact on profit due to the yearonyear changes in exchange
rates was mainly driven by the stronger average euro rate

financial review continued




revenue per seat decreased by 64 to 5846 2015 6248 at constant currency revenue per seat fell by 69 to 5816 the
decrease is attributable to the terrorist events in egypt paris brussels turkey and nice resulting in lower demand and yield the
increasingly competitive capacity environment associated with the lower oil prices and the impact of the uks vote to leave the
european union leading to a more expensive euro for british travellers during the summer
load factor increased by 01 percentage points to 916
revenue per ask decreased by 48 or by 53 at constant currency impacted by a 64 decrease in revenue per seat partially
offset by a 17 decrease in the average sector length mainly from reduced flying to egypt

cost per seat excluding fuel increased by 26 to 3831 but decreased by 11 per seat at constant currency
airports and ground handling cost per seat increased by 61 and by 15 at constant currency charges at regulated airports
increased as anticipated primarily in italy combined with an increase in airport and ground handling costs at gatwick however
these were partially offset by volume deals combined with savings from renegotiated airport and ground handling contracts
crew cost per seat increased by 07 to 678 but decreased by 22 at constant currency this was driven by efficiencies
obtained from the upgauging of our fleet combined with a 17 decrease in average sector length and improved crew scheduling
this was partially offset by pay increases
navigation costs increased by 08 per seat to 421 but decreased by 47 at constant currency driven by a 17 decrease in
average sector length annual price decreases primarily in france and germany and a oneoff 8 million settlement with
eurocontrol in the 2015 financial year
maintenance costs per seat decreased by 30 to 297 and decreased by 53 at constant currency a reduction in the number
of leased aircraft resulted in reduced maintenance costs combined with savings obtained from a new maintenance contract
other costs per seat increased by 08 to 371 per seat and decreased by 19 at constant currency this was driven by a
reduction in aircraft wet leasing and savings in employee costs which was largely offset by an increase in disruption costs as a
result of the terrorist events in egypt paris brussels turkey and nice combined with air traffic control industrial action and
adverse weather conditions resulting in an increase in eu261 associated costs
aircraft dry leasing cost per seat decreased by 144 to 130 and by 143 at constant currency depreciation costs increased by
185 on a per seat basis the movements are principally driven by the acquisition of 20 new aircraft last year and a decrease in
the number of leased aircraft in the fleet the average leased fleet decreased by 64 to 64 and the average owned and finance
leased fleet increased by 126 to 185

financial review continued




net assets increased by 463 million due to the profit generated in the period and favourable movements on the hedging reserve
which were only partially offset by the payment of the ordinary dividend the movement on the hedging reserve was primarily due
to the maturity of out of the money contracts
the net book value of property plant and equipment increased by 375 million driven principally by the acquisition of 20 a320
family aircraft and predelivery payments relating to aircraft purchases

the scope of our audit and our areas of focus                                 the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect

we designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing                these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the
the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements               financial statements as a whole and any comments we make
in particular we looked at where the directors made subjective               on the results of our procedures should be read in this context
judgements for example in respect of significant accounting                  this is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering
future events that are inherently uncertain as in all of our audits
we also addressed the risk of management override of internal
controls including evaluating whether there was evidence of
bias by the directors that represented a risk of material
misstatement due to fraud

significant judgements estimates and critical accounting policies
the preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of
income and expenses during the reporting period although these amounts are based on managements best estimates of the
amount events or actions may mean that actual results ultimately differ from those estimates and these differences may be
material the estimates and the underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly
the following three accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies as they require a significant amount of
management judgement and the results are material to easyjets accounts
aircraft maintenance provisions note 16
easyjet incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in respect of aircraft leased under operating leases during the term of the lease
these arise from legal and constructive contractual obligations relating to the condition of the aircraft when it is returned to the
lessor to discharge these obligations easyjet will also normally need to carry out one heavy maintenance check on each of the
engines and the airframe during the lease term
a charge is made in the income statement based on hours or cycles flown to provide for the cost of these obligations estimates
required include the likely utilisation of the aircraft the expected cost of the heavy maintenance check at the time it is expected to
occur the condition of the aircraft and the lifespan of lifelimited parts
the bases of all estimates are reviewed annually and also when information becomes available that is capable of causing a material
change to an estimate such as renegotiation of end of lease return conditions increased or decreased utilisation or changes in the
cost of heavy maintenance services
other provisions note 16
easyjet incurs liabilities for amounts payable to customers who make claims in respect of flight delays and cancellations and
refunds of air passenger duty or similar charges estimates include passenger claim rates level of claims that will be made and the
period of time over which claims will be made the bases of all estimates are reviewed at least annually and also when information
becomes available that is capable of causing a material change to the estimate
goodwill and landing rights note 8
goodwill and landing rights are tested for impairment at least annually easyjet has one cashgenerating unit being its route
network in making this assessment easyjet has considered the manner in which the business is managed including the centralised
nature of its operations and the ability to open or close routes and redeploy aircraft and crew across the whole route network
the value in use of the cashgenerating unit is determined by discounting future cash flows to their present value when applying
this method easyjet relies on a number of estimates including its strategic plans fuel prices exchange rates longterm economic
growth rates for the principal countries in which it operates and its pretax weighted average cost of capital




                                                                                                                    wwweasyjetcom        91

1 significant accounting policies continued
basis of consolidation
the consolidated accounts incorporate those of easyjet plc and its subsidiaries for the years ended 30 september 2015 and 2016
a full list of subsidiaries can be found in the notes to the company accounts on page 117
a subsidiary is an entity controlled by easyjet plc control is achieved when easyjet is exposed or has rights to variable returns
from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power directly or indirectly over
the investee
intragroup balances transactions and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing
the consolidated accounts
foreign currencies
the primary economic environment in which a subsidiary operates determines its functional currency the consolidated accounts
of easyjet are presented in sterling rounded to the nearest million which is the companys functional currency and the groups
presentation currency certain subsidiaries have operations that are primarily influenced by a currency other than sterling exchange
differences arising on the translation of these foreign operations are taken to shareholders equity until all or part of the interest is
sold when the relevant portion of the accumulated exchange gains or losses is recognised in the income statement profits and
losses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange during the year since this approximates the
rates on the dates of the transactions
transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling using the rate of exchange ruling at the end of
a reporting period and except where the asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge the gains or losses on translation are
included in the income statement nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the transactions were effected
revenue recognition
revenue comprises seat revenue being the value of airline services net of air passenger duty and similar charges vat and
discounts and nonseat revenue
seat revenue arises from the sale of flight seats including the provision of checked baggage allocated seating administration credit
card and change fees seat revenue is recognised when the service is provided this is generally when the flight takes place but in
the following cases this is at the time of booking
    administration and credit card fees as they are contractually nonrefundable and
    change fees as the service provided is that of allowing customers to change bookings

amounts paid by noshow customers are recognised as seat revenue when the booked service is provided as such customers are
not generally entitled to change flights or seek refunds once a flight has departed
unearned revenue represents flight seats including the provision of checked baggage and allocated seating sold but not yet flown
and is held in the statement of financial position until it is realised in the income statement when the service is provided
nonseat revenue arises from commissions earned from services sold on behalf of partners and is recognised when the service is
provided this is generally when the related flight takes place in the case of commission earned from travel insurance revenue is
recognised at the time of booking as easyjet acts solely as appointed representative of the insurance company
business combinations
business combinations in prior years were accounted for by applying the purchase method the cost of the acquisition is measured
at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed plus any costs directly
attributable to the business combination the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the
acquisition date there have been no business combinations since the effective date of ifrs 3 business combinations revised
goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business
combination over easyjets interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
goodwill and other intangible assets
goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses it has an indefinite expected useful life and is tested for
impairment at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment
landing rights are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses they are considered to have an indefinite useful life as
they will remain available for use for the foreseeable future provided minimum utilisation requirements are observed and are tested
for impairment at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment
other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation which is calculated to write off their cost less estimated
residual value on a straightline basis over their expected useful lives expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually

equivalently aged assets and depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis the carrying value is reviewed for
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable for aircraft easyjet
is dependent on airbus as its sole supplier this gives rise to a valuation risk which crystallises when aircraft exit the fleet where
easyjet is reliant on the future demand for secondhand aircraft
an element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed on acquisition to prepaid maintenance and is depreciated over a period
ranging from seven to ten years from the date of manufacture subsequent costs incurred which lend enhancement to future
periods such as longterm scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft and engines are capitalised and depreciated
over the length of period benefiting from these enhancements all other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement
as incurred
predelivery and option payments made in respect of aircraft are recorded in property plant and equipment at cost these amounts
are not depreciated interest attributed to predelivery and option payments made in respect of aircraft and other qualifying assets
under construction are capitalised and added to the cost of the asset concerned
gains and losses on disposals other than aircraft sale and leaseback transactions are determined by comparing the net proceeds
with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement
impairment of noncurrent assets
an impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the assets or cashgenerating units fair
value less cost to sell and its value in use impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not reversed impairment losses recognised
on assets other than goodwill are only reversed where changes in the estimates used result in an increase in recoverable amount
leases
easyjet enters into sale and leaseback transactions whereby it sells either new or midlife aircraft to a third party and immediately
leases it back under an operating lease surpluses arising on disposal where the price that the aircraft is sold for is above fair value
are recognised in deferred income and amortised in the income statement on a straightline basis over the expected lease term
in some operating sale and leaseback arrangements receipt of part of the proceeds is deferred until the end of the lease the
amount of which is recorded as deferred consideration within noncurrent or current assets as appropriate
additionally in some cases receipt of part of the sales proceeds due is exchanged for a reduction in future lease rentals which
consequently are below market price as a result the proceeds received on sale and leaseback are lower than the fair value of the
aircraft sold the resulting shortfall is deferred within noncurrent or current assets as appropriate and amortised on a straightline
basis in the income statement over the expected lease term
noncontingent operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the life of the lease
a number of operating leases require easyjet to make contingent rental payments based on variable interest rates these are
expensed as incurred
finance leases which transfer to easyjet substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item are
recognised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or if lower at the present value of the minimum lease
payments any directly attributable costs of entering into financing sale and leasebacks are included in the value of the asset
recognised lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability finance charges are included in interest payable and other
financing charges

financial instruments
financial instruments are recognised when easyjet becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and
derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions
where market values are not available the fair value of financial instruments is calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing
interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates
nonderivative financial assets
nonderivative financial assets are recorded at amortised cost and include trade receivables cash and cash equivalents and money
market deposits
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held in bank accounts with no access restrictions and bank deposits and triparty
repos repayable on demand or maturing within three months of inception interest income on cash and money market deposits is
recognised using the effective interest method restricted cash comprises cash deposits which have restrictions governing their
use and is classified as a current or noncurrent asset based on the estimated remaining length of the restriction
impairment losses are recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost where there is objective evidence that an impairment
loss has been incurred the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present
value of future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate
if subsequently the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event that
occurred after the impairment was recognised the appropriate portion of the loss is reversed both impairment losses and reversals
are recognised in the income statement as components of net finance charges
nonderivative financial liabilities
nonderivative financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently at
amortised cost and include trade and other payables borrowings and provisions interest expense on borrowings is recognised
using the effective interest method
borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
12 months after the reporting period date
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
easyjet uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency risks on transactions denominated in us
dollars euros swiss francs and south african rand these transactions primarily affect revenue fuel and aircraft dry leasing costs
and the carrying value of owned aircraft easyjet also uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge currency and interest rate
risk on certain borrowings and jet fuel forward contracts to hedge fuel price risks
derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value hedge accounting is applied to those derivative financial instruments that
are designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges
fair value hedges
changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement
together with any changes in the fair values of the hedged assets or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk
cash flow hedges
gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of forward contracts are recognised in other comprehensive income and
deferred in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are determined to be effective all other changes in fair value are
recognised immediately in the income statement
when the hedged forecast transaction relates to an item of property plant and equipment the relevant accumulated gains and
losses are transferred from the hedging reserve and included in the initial carrying amount of that purchased asset otherwise they
are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects the income statement
in the event that a hedged forecast transaction is no longer considered highly probable any related gains and losses are
immediately transferred from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement
hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is derecognised eg through expiry or disposal or no longer qualifies
for hedge accounting where the hedged item remains a highly probable forecast transaction the related gains and losses remain
deferred in the hedging reserve until the transaction takes place
financial guarantees
if a claim on a financial guarantee given to a third party becomes probable the obligation is recognised at fair value for subsequent
measurement the carrying amount is the higher of initial measurement and best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the
obligation at the reporting date
tax
tax expense in the income statement consists of current and deferred tax tax is recognised in the income statement except when
it relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income or shareholders equity the charge for current tax is
based on the results for the year as adjusted for income that is exempt and expenses that are not deductible using tax rates that
are applicable to the taxable income

deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences relating to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities where it is




                                                                                                                                               strategic report
probable that the recovery or settlement will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less tax in the future with the
following exceptions
   where the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination
    of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither taxable income nor accounting profit and
   deferred tax arising on investments in subsidiaries is not recognised where easyjet is able to control the reversal of the
    temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future




                                                                                                                                               governance
deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which recovery of assets and settlement of
liabilities are expected to take place based on tax rates or laws enacted or substantively enacted at the date of the statement of
financial position
deferred tax assets represent amounts recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences losses and tax
credits carried forwards deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits
from which they can be deducted
deferred tax liabilities represent the amount of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences




                                                                                                                                               accounts
deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis
aircraft maintenance provisions
the accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned and financeleased
aircraft is described in the accounting policy for property plant and equipment
easyjet has contractual obligations to maintain aircraft held under operating leases provisions are created over the term of the
lease based on the estimated future costs of major airframe checks engine shop visits and end of lease liabilities these costs are
discounted to present value
where an aircraft is sold and leased back other than when first delivered to easyjet a liability to undertake future maintenance
activities resulting from past flying activity arises at the point the lease agreement is signed this liability is treated as part of the
surplus or shortfall arising on the sale and leaseback the accounting treatment of which is described in the leases accounting policy
a number of leases also require easyjet to pay recoverable supplemental rent to the lessor the purpose of these payments is
to provide the lessor with collateral should an aircraft be returned in a condition that does not meet the requirements of the lease
this recoverable supplemental rent is included in trade and other receivables within current assets and other noncurrent assets as
applicable and is refunded when qualifying heavy maintenance is performed or is offset against the costs incurred at the end of
the lease
employee benefits
easyjet contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of its employees easyjet has no further payment
obligations once the contributions have been paid the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of easyjet in
independently administered funds easyjets contributions are charged to the income statement in the year in which they
are incurred
the expected cost of compensated holidays is recognised at the time that the related employees services are provided
share capital and dividend distribution
ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are
shown in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds
where any group company or employee benefit trust purchases the companys equity shares the consideration paid and any
directly attributable incremental costs are deducted from retained earnings until the shares are cancelled or reissued proceeds
from reissue are shown as a credit to retained earnings
easyjet settles share awards under the long term incentive plan the save as you earn scheme and share incentive plans by
purchasing its own shares on the market through employee benefit trusts the cost of such purchases is deducted from retained
earnings in the period that the transaction occurs
dividend distributions to the companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved
by the companys shareholders
sharebased payments
easyjet has a number of equitysettled share incentive schemes the fair value of share options granted under the save as you
earn scheme is measured at the date of grant using the binomial lattice option pricing model the fair value of grants under the
tsrbased long term incentive plan is estimated under the stochastic model also known as the monte carlo model the fair value
of all other awards is the share price at the date of grant




                                                                                                                   wwweasyjetcom       95

notes to the accounts continued




1 significant accounting policies continued
the fair value of the estimated number of options and awards that are expected to vest is expensed to the income statement on
a straightline basis over the period that employees services are rendered with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity
where nonmarket performance criteria such as roce attached to the share options and awards are not met any cumulative
expense previously recognised is reversed for awards with marketrelated performance criteria such as tsr an expense is
recognised irrespective of whether the market condition is satisfied
the social security obligations payable in connection with grant of the share options are an integral part of the grant itself and the
charge is treated as a cashsettled transaction
segmental disclosures
easyjet has one operating segment being its route network based on management information provided to the executive
management team which is easyjets chief operating decision maker resource allocation decisions are made for the benefit of the
route network as a whole rather than for individual routes within the network performance of the network is assessed based on the
consolidated profit or loss before tax for the year
revenue is allocated to geographic segments on the following bases
    revenue earned from passengers is allocated according to the location of the first departure airport on each booking and
    commission revenue earned from partners is allocated according to the domicile of each partner

the fair value measurement hierarchy levels have been defined as follows
   level 1 fair value of financial instruments based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
   level 2 fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example over the counter derivatives
    which are determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible
    on entityspecific estimates
   level 3 fair value of financial instruments that are not based on observable market data

amounts disclosed in the other column are items that do not meet the definition of a financial instrument they are disclosed to
facilitate reconciliation of the carrying values of financial instruments to line items presented in the statement of financial position
fair value calculation methodology
the fair values of derivatives and financial instruments have been determined by reference to observable market prices where the
instruments are traded where available where market prices are not available the fair value has been estimated by discounting
expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates

22 financial risk and capital management
easyjet is exposed to financial risks including fluctuations in exchange rates jet fuel prices and interest rates financial risk
management aims to limit these market risks with selected derivative hedging instruments being used for this purpose easyjets
policy is not to trade in derivatives but to use the instruments to hedge anticipated exposure as such easyjet is not exposed to
market risk by using derivatives as any gains and losses arising are offset by the outcome of the underlying exposure being hedged
in addition to market risks easyjet is exposed to credit and liquidity risk
the board is responsible for setting financial risk and capital management policies and objectives which are implemented by the
treasury function on a daytoday basis the policy outlines the approach to risk management and also states the instruments and
time periods which the treasury function is authorised to use in managing financial risks the policy is regularly reviewed to ensure
best practice however there have been no significant changes during the current year
capital employed

credit risk management
easyjet is exposed to credit risk arising from cash and money market deposits derivative financial instruments and trade and other
receivables credit risk management aims to reduce the risk of default by setting limits on credit exposure to counterparties based
on their respective credit ratings credit ratings also determine the maximum period of investment when placing funds on deposit
credit risk is limited to the carrying amount in the statement of financial position at each year end
counterparties for cash investments currency forward contracts crosscurrency interest rate swap contracts foreign currency swap
contracts and jet fuel forward contracts are required to have a longterm credit rating of a or better at contract inception
exposures to these counterparties are regularly reviewed and if the long term credit rating falls below a management will make a
decision on remedial action to be taken
disclosure relating to the credit quality of trade and other receivables is given in note 11
foreign currency risk management
the majority of easyjets exposure to currency arises from fluctuations in the us dollar euro and swiss franc exchange rates which
can significantly impact easyjets financial results and cash flows the aim of the foreign currency risk management is to reduce the
impact of these exchange rate fluctuations
significant currency exposures in the income statement are managed through the use of currency forward contracts in line with the
board approved policy the policy states that easyjet hedges between 65  85 of the next 12 months forecast surplus cash
flows on a rolling basis and 45  65 of the following 12 months forecast surplus cash flows on a rolling basis
significant currency exposures relating to the acquisition cost of aircraft is also managed through the use of currency forward
contracts and foreign exchange swap contracts where up to 90 of the next 24 months forecast requirement is hedged in
addition easyjet has substantial borrowings and other liabilities denominated in us dollars and euros which are largely offset by
holding us dollar and euro cash and money market deposits
significant currency exposures relating to foreign currency denominated debt issuances are managed through the use of
crosscurrency interest rate swap contracts where deemed appropriate these hedges are designated as fair value hedges
where possible where hedge accounting has been elected changes in the fair value of derivatives including changes in the fair
value of the hedged liabilities are recorded in the income statement
management may take action to hedge other currency exposures as deemed appropriate
financing and interest rate risk management
interest rate cash flow risk arises on floating rate borrowings and cash investments
interest rate risk management policy aims to provide certainty in a proportion of financing while retaining the opportunity to benefit
from interest rate reductions all borrowings are at floating interest rates repricing every three to six months a significant proportion
of us dollar loans by value are matched with us dollar cash operating leases are a mix of fixed and floating rates of the 63
operating leases in place at 30 september 2016 2015 67 73 were based on fixed interest rates and 27 were based on floating
interest rates 2015 75 fixed 25 floating
in addition on 7 january 2016 easyjet plc issued a 3000 million european medium term note programme under this programme
on 9 february 2016 easyjet plc issued notes amounting to 500 million for a sevenyear term with a fixed annual coupon rate of
1750 the proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes

24 contingent liabilities
easyjet is involved in a number of disputes and litigation which arose in the normal course of business the likely outcome of these
disputes and litigation cannot be predicted and in complex cases reliable estimates of any potential obligation may not be possible
having reviewed the information currently available management considers that the ultimate resolution of these disputes and
litigation is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on easyjets results cash flows or financial position
at 30 september 2016 easyjet had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds totalling 49 million 2015 44 million
of which 38 million 2015 33 million expires within one year the fair value of these instruments at each year end was negligible
no amount is recognised on the statement of financial position in respect of any of these financial instruments as it is not probable
that there will be an outflow of resources
