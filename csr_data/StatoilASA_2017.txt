the kalundborg symbiosis is a success because the companies
involved actively invest time and resources in the relationships
partnerships are based on mutual trust and long term bilateral
commitments creating a cooperative and innovative culture
dedicated to finding common solutions for resource efficiency
the kalundborg symbiosis is still evolving companies are now
creating more complex links growing out of the need to adapt to
new pollution control measures

1 for processing and refining activities equity share is in principle based on ownership percentage in cases where the ownership percentage is significantly different from the
economic substance of the relationship eg statoils ownership in a processing facility does not correspond to statoils economic interest in the facilitys throughput a percentage
corresponding to economic interest is applied in order to calculate statoils equity co2 emissions for the facility
for partneroperated oil and gas production assets co2 emissions data is in principle obtained from the operating companies as such the way in which co2 emissions are quantified
by our partneroperators may vary and statoils ability to quality assure such data is limited in cases where it is not practicable to obtain assetspecific co2 emissions data within
statoil reporting deadlines estimation based upon eg historical data or industry intensity figures applied to actual production figures may be utilised
2 a locationbased calculation method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids using mostly gridaverage emission factor data a marketbased method reflects emissions
from electricity that companies have purposefully chosen or their lack of choice it derives emission factors from contracts between two parties for the sale and purchase of energy

reporting boundaries
defining consistent boundaries for sustainability reporting is challenging due to the complexity of ownership and operational
arrangements such as joint operating agreements we strive to be consistent and transparent about variations in boundaries
nonfinancial data are reported on a 100  basis for companies and joint ventures where we are the operator or the technical service
provider unless otherwise stated we report this way in line with industry practice because these are the data we can directly manage
and affect

   we report health and safety incident data for our operated assets facilities and vessels including subsidiaries and operations where
    we are the technical service provider in addition we include contracted drilling rigs floatels and vessels projects and modifications
    and the transportation of personnel and products using a risk based approach6

   we report environmental data on a 100  basis for our operated assets facilities and vessels including subsidiaries and operations
    where we are the technical service provider and for contracted drilling rigs and flotels environmental data represent our direct
    emissions discharges consumption etc unless otherwise stated

6we apply a framework of minimum requirements for recording of safety and environmental data for operations within our control in addition

we apply a business riskbased approach to data recording extending our sphere of influence beyond what is considered to be within our operational control
