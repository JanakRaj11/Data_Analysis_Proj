           primary environmental influence of steel production and countermeasures
              jfe has been dealing with environmental problems primarily as related to the steel production sector since the early 1970s the
              group has developed leadingedge technologies and carried out strict voluntary control in protection of the air and the waters
              representative technologies developed for protecting clean air and water include the desulfurization and denitrification system
              for flue gas from the sintering process for preventing air pollution and the biological wastewater treatment for preventing water
              pollution

              the steel industry uses large amount of energy and as such places great importance on energy conservation following the
              oil crises considerable effort has been expended to achieve major reductions in energy consumption resulting in significant
              contributions to the prevention of global warming a variety of energy conservation measures have been implemented such
              as elimination of some of the processes and making them continuous conversion to alternative energy has been promoted for
              reducing dependence on oil following the second oil crisis aggressive investment has been made on largescale energyconserving
              plants such as largescale waste heat recovery systems as a result the energy consumption rate per ton of crude steel production is
              now about 20 less than in 1973

                      preventing global warming
                      global warming is an important problem that is deeply related with the activities of all in society
                      including the business sector japan has developed measures to deal with global warming in
                      particular the guideline of measures to prevent global warming and ratified the kyoto protocol
                      in june 2002 the japanese target of 6 for reduction in greenhouse gases as specified in the
                      kyoto protocol is of considerable severity in comparison to that of the eu which is able to look
                      forward to conversion to new energy sources and the benefits of integration with the former
                      eastern block nations in resolving these problems the role of technology will be of utmost
                      importance
                      jfe will deal with the problem of global warming employing its worldtop level expertise and
                      potentiality in technological development

           voluntary environmental action plan by japan business federation
              japan business federation nippon keidanren established the voluntary action plan in 1997 the plan sets a target to reduce co2
              emissions in the industrial and energy conversion sectors to the 1990 levels by the year 2010 the federations followup for the
              plan reports that progress is on track to achieve the target


           voluntary measures by the steel industry
              the japan iron and steel federation established its voluntary action plan concerning the steel industrys environmental
              protection in december 1996 the plan sets a target to reduce energy consumption by 10 in comparison to the 1990 level by the
              year 2010 later a further 15 reduction was added to this target by increasing waste plastics injection into blast furnace subject
              to improvements in the collection system in order to reach this target the achievement is investigated annually and reported to the
              government council by 2000 efforts had resulted in a reduction of 61 in energy consumption in comparison to the 1990 level
              indicating that measures taken by each steelmaker such as improvements in efficiency in production equipment and improvements
              in operating techniques are bearing fruit

achievement of energy conservation measures by jfe
 jfe has been aggressive in its pursuit of energy conservation measures since the first oil crisis such measures include recovery of
 waste energy improvements in efficiency of equipment introduction of continuous processes and development of comprehensive
 energy management systems these measures have resulted in energy savings of approximately 20 measures taken since 1990 to
 deal with global warming are steadily reducing energy consumption required to produce one ton of crude steel
 based on the japan iron and steel federations voluntary action plan it is planned to reduce energy consumption per ton of crude
 steel in 2010 by 44 in comparison to the 1995 level although energy consumption in 2001 remained nearly at a same level
 as in 2000 trends are currently proceeding as planned continuous introduction of new measures in the future is planned these
 measures will include the development of nextgeneration iron making technology and more use of waste plastics

                   strengthening of regulations as a result of shortage of final waste disposal sites and problems
                   caused by illegal damping and the necessity of transforming the society from mass production
                   mass consumption and mass disposal to a recyclingoriented one have begun to effect a
                   revolution in the fundamental paradigm of manufacture jfe is engaged in an aggressive policy
                   of effective use of resources it also expects much of the new businesses would be developed in
                   association with this change

reduction reuse and recycling of slag
 slag amounts to approximately 90 of all byproducts of the iron and steel making process and is generated by blast furnaces
 bofs and electric furnaces jfe employs a preliminary hot metal treatment process and promotes onsite reuse of steel making
 slag thus reducing the volume of slag produced in steel making developments of technologies for processing and using of
 byproducts and making them compatible with jis standards have produced benefits in terms of effective use of more than 99 of
 the slag as roadbed material concrete aggregate and raw material for cement
 jfe has developed the following slag recycling techniques
 1 use of the hydration hardening reaction in the manufacture of waveabsorbing blocks for use in marine structures ferroform
 2 commercialization of slowrelease potassium silicate fertilizer by addition of a potassium material
 3 use of water retaining properties of blast furnace slag in the production of paving materials to mitigate the heat island effect
 4 use of co2 absorption technology in the production of carbonated solid blocks of slag to be
     used for constructing artificial reefs for seaweed and fish farming marine blocks
 jfe is further developing new technologies and applications for iron and steel making slag that
 will prove useful in improving the global environment

dioxin analysis 4
 dioxin concentration measurement with the jis method takes approximately ten days as dioxin concentrations are normally
                                                                                                                                                                   environment

 extremely low there is no equipment that can automatically and directly measure dioxin concentrations


 precursor analysis technology
 this technology takes advantage of the high correlation of concentrations of dioxin precursors chlorobenzenes and
 chlorophenoles with those of dioxins concentrations of a wide variety of dioxin precursors are measured simultaneously and
 continuously concentrations of dioxins are estimated within a short analysis cycle approximately 15 minutes this technology
 has been commercialized through joint research with toa dkk


 new analytical method
 this method reduces the time required for the cleanup process for separating and removing the components that hinder dioxin
 analysis and reduces the time required for analysis by half to four or five days tests have confirmed that the accuracy is equivalent
 to the jis method despite the reduced analysis time

manufacture of concrete form board nf board from recycled plastics
 in addition to chemical recycling primarily by using blast furnaces jfe is also working on materials recycling the scale of
 operations was expanded to a commercial level in 2002 the use of waste plastics as a substitute for plywood in producing concrete
 forms reduces co2 emissions and protects tropical forest resources used nf boards are recovered and employed as iron making
 material thus contributing to zero emissions


recycling of used pet bottles
 the jfe group runs a used pet bottles recycling operation in the keihin district
 this operation recycles used pet bottles selectively collected by local municipalities
 into pet flakes the flakes are then sold to manufacturers of pet sheet used in egg
 packs etc and polyester fiber labels and caps are used as iron making material
 thus contributing to zero emissions

  chs is a new cooling medium first developed by jfe as a substitute for cold water trial calculations indicate that the air
  conditioning system using this new medium can reduce energy consumption by approximately 50 in comparison with
  conventional ones that use cold water it is expected that this technology for conserving energy and reducing co2 emissions
  from household appliances will make significant contributions hydrate slurry is twophase fluid comprised of fine particles of
  clathrate hydrate and its aqueous solution and holds latent heat over the same temperature range 5  12c as cold water used for

           investment in environmental protection
              due to the location of jfes steelworks in close proximity to major urban areas particular efforts have been expended in
              environmental protection various facilities have been installed eg desulfurization and denitrification facilities to deal with
              atmospheric sox and nox and water treatment facilities to reduce cod and deal with water pollution a cumulative total of
              approximately 470 billion yen has been invested throughout the company in environmentrelated facilities since 1973 resulting in
              a worlds top level of cleanliness in its steelworks
              to further promote the establishment of a recyclingoriented society jfe has recently began an aggressive program of investment
              for the effective conversion of byproducts from the iron and steel making process for use as resources and recycling them through
              the iron and steel making process

 investment in environmentrelated facilities was 168 billion yen which accounted for approximately 16 of the total capital
 investment of the year expenses were 692 billion yen the primary focus of investment was environmental protection and
 prevention of global warming primary expenses were for environmental protection effective use of resources and prevention of
 global warming the majority of these expenses were for operation and maintenance and depreciation
 environmentrelated research and development expenses amounted to 42 billion yen approximately 13 of total research and
 development expenses activities in 2001 have achieved a recycling rate of 995 and energy conservation benefits amount to 25
 billion yen


future challenges
 the purpose of environmental accounting is to monitor and evaluate the status of environmental activities in a quantitative manner
 as much as possible in accordance with this purpose continuous review of item classifications and scope of data collection etc
 will be conducted for further refinement in methodologies of environmental accounting including the following
  verification and clarification of the criteria for determining what investment and expenses are to be increased or decreased
  investigation of the methodology for lca reflecting the progress made in upstream and downstream industries
  further investigations of the methodology for quantifying benefits
