at vodafone greece we believe that an integrated corporate responsibility program relates to how a company is managed operates
and behaves towards society stakeholders and the environment in our definition a company is responsible when at the same time
as achieving its commercial objectives it also takes into account the impact of its operations on society as a whole and takes suitable
steps in that regard with measurable results consequently depending on the extent of its activities and without this necessarily
translating into financial outlays the company is obliged to reduce its potential negative impact and bolster its positive impact on
the world around it

this percentage represents energy savings
that equals 18600 mwh for base stations and
6400 mwh for mtxs and data centers


in corporate responsibility report for 20082009 we cal
culated the savings in energy being consumed by the net
work in percentage terms to be 30 and we have set the
objective of maintaining this percentage according to
these new calculations the savings in energy being con
sumed by the network for 20082009 was 23 resulting
in a readjustment in the objective for 20092010
