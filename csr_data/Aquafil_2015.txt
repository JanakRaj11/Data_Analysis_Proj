identifying sustainability issues g420 g421

the evaluation of relevant aspects for aquafil was carried out by establish
ing an internal interdisciplinary technical committee which conducted an
analysis on the aspects proposed in the g4 sustainability reporting guidelines
regarding current and future business prospects                                                        identification of the relevant aspects
the evaluation was based on internal sources such as the previous sustaina                                  in terms of sustainability
bility reports policies and company mission and external standards and opin                              aquafil technical committee

this approach enabled us to single out 29 relevant aspects from the 45 pro
posed by the guidelines

the technical committee assigned priority to the relevant issues according to
the interest of business activities actively involving a panel of stakeholders in                            involvement of stakeholders
the process                                                                                                    by using a questionnaire
stakeholders involvement began when a questionnaire was distributed asking
for feedback on how aqualfils management directly affects their own interests
and business decisions                                                                                   analysis of the questionnaire and
priority assignment and the involvement of stakeholders allowed for the                                          matrix elaboration
constrution of aquafils sustainability materiality matrix where 10 material
aspects relevant to both aquafil and its stakeholders emerge

           eight environmental aspects to be considered in the report many of which had already

the web tool for environmental reporting

the web tool is an online tool for gathering information concerning the environment and for
calculating performance indicators

in 2014 the web tool became fully operational in the company dynamics each plant accesses
the tool on a monthly basis and inputs data related to a range of environmental issues such as ener
gy and water consumption emissions into bodies of water and waste

the tool is used for calculating realtime performance indicators and compares them with the
expected value for that indicator in this way each plant is able to undertake preventative meas
ures regarding its progress
the expected value is evaluated annually by aquafil and is the reference value for the environ
mental aspect under study

the reliability of the information entered is ensured by doublechecking data and indicators
carried out by the managers of each plant and the platform administrator




in this section of the report each environmental aspect was quantified by selecting the most repre
sented indicator of the group among those recommended by the gri

the methodology used and the analyses of variations in the indicators over time are reported for each
environmental aspect many of them refer to the groups net production in 2014 intended as the
amount of product sold

one of the most keenly felt aspects for the group is good energy management as it produces
positive effects not only from an environmental perspective by reducing the consumption of
nonrenewable resources but also from an economic point of view                                                                                                                                                    185

          pay to their employees taxes paid to the governments in operational territo
          ries and money generated by its commercial activities

          ritory benefits from the wealth generated in both cases salaries allow for
          further economic gain consumption and wellbeing while the tax deducted
          from the employees salaries used to finance the goverments and the amount
          allocated for contributions and charges is used for providing welfare services

              contributions is approximately 18 million equal to 16 of the turnover
