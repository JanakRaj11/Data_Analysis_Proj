first they would ask an external printing contractor to make several varieties of preprinted labels showing the company logo and
the red diamond for the picture symbol in the places designated in the ghs standard then using their own barcode label
software they would print barcodes product information and picture symbols for each chemical on the preprinted labels using
a monochrome thermal label printer as a result we discovered that customers faced the following issues

in order to solve these problems faced by customers the product plan for the tmc7500 was developed with a focus on achiev
ing color high speed and high resolution and the ability to move to an environment enabling smooth ondemand color label
printing leveraging customers existing label printing environments


1 to achieve color high speed and high resolution the printer is equipped with precisioncore lineheads with print speeds of up
  to 300 mm per second


2 the internal memory of the printer comes with a stock of images equipping the printer with a function for combining this

3 in order to leverage customers existing label printing environments the printer is equipped with zplii commands which are
  standard in the monochrome thermal label printing environments and esc label commands including epsons proprietary

4 by working with companies that produce three types of barcode label printing software popular with customers we incorpo
  rated the three types of software in the tmc7500 native driver to achieve an environment that enables ondemand color label
  printing without customers having to change their systems

epson and the environment

environmental vision 2050

in 2008 epson established its environmental vision 2050 as a longterm guide for environmental action and has since been
working to realize the vision




                                                                         




epson has set key conditions below to work towards achieving environmental vision 2050


1 reduction of co2 emissions by 90 across the entire product life cycle
2 inclusion of all products in the resource reuse and recycling loop
3 restoration and preservation of biodiversity as a member of the ecosystem together with local communities

digital textile printing is greener than traditional analog textile printing since the digital process is shorter and does not require
plates it uses anywhere from 40 to 75 less electrical power and water than a traditional process as well as far less ink and
fewer chemical products2

equipped with a newly developed gps module and miniature ring antenna

epson developed a new gps module for small accurate lowpower solar watches and combined it with a small yet acutely
sensitive ringshaped antenna that captures even weak gps satellite signals so that it can automatically correct the time any
where in the world

                                                                  newly developed gps module

the new gps chip enabled us to reduce the size of the re
chargeable battery used in the 8x series and incorporate it
inside the movement


in addition the 8x series has one circuit board instead of two
because the board components were mounted on both sides
of the board this enabled us to reduce the thickness of the
watch head by 35 mm

realization of a stable power supply

since about 10000 times more current is consumed when receiving gps signals than when
simply keeping time we developed a new radio wave reception algorithm lithiumion battery
and a lowpower charge control circuit that controls the charging and discharging of the battery
to dramatically reduce power consumption

epson has manufacturing sites and sales centers in all parts of the world making environmentallyconscious transportation an
important consideration here we present examples of such environmentallyconscious transportation initiatives in which we
introduced high cube containers1 and changed our shipping method

    with a height of 9 ft 6 in about 26 m they are 1 ft about 30 cm taller than standard containers whose height is 8 feet 6 inches about 23 m



topic 1 improving transport efficiency with high cube containers

currently high cube containers account for about 70 of shipping containers in the marketplace hitherto epson has used the
standard type of container for shipping products from its factories but with the widespread adoption of high cube containers
we are gradually making the switch


since the inner dimensions of the containers are higher palletizing products for standard containers resulted in wasted space
amounting to about 10 optimizing the pallets for high cube containers reduces the number of containers required contribut

results of switching containers for shipping to the us




 we have calculated the reductions in co2 emissions emitted when transporting containers by cargo ship train and truck from our manufacturing affiliates in southeast asia as a result
  of reducing the number of containers shipped to the us by about 200 the unit indicator by the japan ship technology research association is used for calculating emissions during
  sea transport



topic 2 reduced environmental impact by changing printhead shipping

previously printheads for shipping to our printer manufacturing sites in indone
sia were gathered from our plants around japan at tohoku epson in yamagata
prefecture and transported by truck to narita airport for air transportation by
establishing a sea transportation pipeline from sakata port which is located

   stress diagnoses

   since 2004 all employees in japan have received an occupational stress diagnosis when they get their periodic medical checkup
   the main purpose is to help employees practice selfcare when they feel stress occupational physicians nurses and industrial
   counselors follow up with employees diagnosed as highly stressed this has facilitated early detection and response to mental health
   troubles

   nationally a stress diagnosis system came into force in december 2015 based on the industrial safety and health act we have
   updated our own diagnoses by adding considerations required by the law we have established group stress diagnosis standards
   wkdwzhuhgholehudwhgewkh6dihwdqghdowkrpplwwhhvriurxsfrpsdqlhvsodqwvdqgrĵfhvlqdsdq6wduwlqjlq
   our stress diagnoses follow these standards we use this process not only to help employees practice selfcare against stress but
   also to improve the workplace environment

   gether closely to provide better support

managing sanitation in employee cafeterias

a food poisoning incident occurred in one of our employee cafeterias in 2011 this prompted periodic inspections of kitchen

work together during these inspections in this manner we are improving the state of sanitation management and addressing any
facility problems the risk is not only in japan if a food poisoning incident were to happen at an employee cafeteria at a large
scale production site overseas especially in china or southeast asia it could seriously impact employees health and impede
business continuity therefore since fy2012 we have been taking steps at production sites in china indonesia malaysia singa
pore and the philippines to manage sanitation and risk

compliant with each nations law international rules and the spirit of the same cleaving to a high sense of ethics and acting for
the good of society in keeping with this policy epson encourages procurement of paper products with due consideration for
the social economic and environmental sustainability of forests


thus epson manages its entire supply chain from the immediate supplier all the way back to the forest to ensure the legality

sustainable procurement

raising awareness

practicing csr throughout the supply chain

epson selects suppliers using fair criteria and procedures based on its basic procurement policy we have established internal
rules that set forth criteria for selecting excellent supplier candidates that can provide us with a stable supply of quality parts and
raw materials at fair prices


in accordance with this rule we now undertake a new supplier evaluation that focuses on appropriate environmental manage
ment fair employment practices and legalistic approaches to human rights and so on we decide our suppliers based on this
evaluation


we also conduct a comprehensive annual evaluation of every supplier with which we do regular business this periodic evalua
wlrqfryhuvıyhlwhpvuhodwlqjwrvxssolhuvŗshuirupdqfhjhqhudopdqdjhphqwhqylurqphqwdopdqdjhphqwtxdolwpdqdjh
ment cost management and delivery deadline management by reviewing the evaluation result we can gain a clearer picture of
a supplier and its practices therefore contributing to stable supply if a supplier receives a poor evaluation we ask the company
concerned to submit a corrective action plan we then reevaluate the supplier and provide feedback about the results this
process aims to achieve better and stronger relationship with our suppliers on the other hand we have set a procedure to
terminate transactions with suppliers that have consistently failed periodical evaluations a supplier that demonstrates poor
results for two successive years is put on a watch list with transactions suspended if this continues for two more years

epsons procurement guidelines and communicated our approach to csr which aims to foster trust with all stakeholders to
develop goodwill with the local and international communities and to contribute to improving society as a whole we aim to use
these activities as a start point to promote initiatives for socially responsible procurement in cooperation with our suppliers


compliance management

the letter and the spirit of local and international laws and regulations in every country and region around the world we consider
