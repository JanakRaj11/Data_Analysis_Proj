b    rbc corporate responsibility report 2007
     title

a year of doing better

                  2007 was a watershed year for corporate responsibility at rbc  we developed the
                  rbc blueprint for doing better our new corporate responsibility strategy and framework
                  and established two focus areas diversity and the environment we were the first
                  canadian bank to launch our own mutual funds for socially responsible investors and
                  introduced environmentally sustainable product options for retail consumers we received
                  a record number of awards for our corporate responsibility efforts at the same time
                  we continued to deliver strong returns to our shareholders and were rewarded with
                  increased business from our clients

                  this is sustainability in action when a company manages financial social environmental
                  and ethical performance today in order to ensure continued success tomorrow

                  when it comes to corporate responsibility companies are often expected to be everything
                  to everyone for a company like rbc  with more than 15 million clients in 38 countries
                  and more than 70000 employees worldwide managing diverse stakeholder expectations
                  can be a challenge over the last few years our stakeholders have grown in number and
                  influence and we have seen increased expectations and attention regarding corporate
                  sustainability and reporting across all industries

                  thats why we developed a new strategic approach for corporate responsibility in 2007
                  a focused set of priorities to ensure that we are appropriately managing our programs
                  and initiatives under the corporate responsibility banner you can read about our approach
                  on the next three pages

                  we are not only in the digital age but in an era where we must use the planets resources
                  wisely this year our sustainability reporting continues its migration online and our
                  full corporate responsibility report and public accountability statement is only available
                  in electronic format we are publishing a shorter corporate responsibility review in
                  print and continue to include corporate responsibility information in our annual report
                  finally we continue to enhance our communications with nongovernmental organizations
                   ngos and provide detailed direct reporting to analysts and researchers from the
                  socially responsible investment community
