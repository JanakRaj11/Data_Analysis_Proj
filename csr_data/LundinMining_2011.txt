                                environmental responsibility



lundin mining recognizes that its operations can have significant economic
social and environmental impacts on local communities throughout the life
cycle of our mining operations

some of these impacts include land use changes
environmental degradation and population influx offset
by increased economic opportunities and development
in the areas of infrastructure health and education we
operate under the precautionary principle throughout
the life of a mine this involves the use of baseline
assessment tools and conducting environmental and
social impact assessments evaluating how to avoid
mitigate or control potentially significant impacts
implementing appropriate monitoring and management
systems and addressing the requirements for mine

material inputs
mining and metallurgical operations consume
considerable quantities of materials lundin mining
recognizes that material intensity is both an environmental
and a financial consideration we continuously seek
ways to improve both material efficiency and the costs
associated with material flows
the principal raw material input for a mining company is
the ore mined other major raw materials are explosives
and fuel both quantified in this report and mill reagents
both nevescorvo and zinkgruvan have put in place
plans to lower ammonia concentrations in water
discharged from the mine by using emulsion explosives

energy use
lundin minings concern is to ensure that each of our
operations has access to a secure and costeffective
supply of energy this is crucial for the continued
operation and growth of our business the reliability and
affordability of energy supply can be affected by factors
beyond our control including increased demand
political regulatory and economic uncertainties and
problems with local generation and transmission of power
energy costs continue to represent one of our most
significant operating expenditures and consequently
improving energy efficiency reduces the emission of
greenhouse gases and equally improves our competitive
positioning in a resourceconstrained environment
in 2010 overall electricity consumption declined slightly
due to introduction of more energyefficient equipment
at nevescorvo and zinkgruvan as well as the reduced
production level at aguablanca and the progressive
closure at galmoy this was offset slightly by increased
production and hoisting of ore and waste at nevescorvo
our direct energy is derived from diesel and fuel oil used
on site and diesel used in transportation of products as
tabulated above diesel consumption onsite increased
in 2010 primarily as a result of aguablanca hauling
more than 40 more waste rock out of the pit in 2010
compared with the previous year zinkgruvan used more           diesel on site 000 litres
than twice the previous years amount of heating oil in

greenhouse gas emissions
lundin minings longterm objective is to reduce both
energy and greenhouse gas ghg intensity through
energy efficiency improvements and if needed through
the use of carbon credits and offsets
in 2010 total co2 emissions decreased by 22 compared
with the previous year partly as a result of increases in
efficiency factors for electricity generation in portugal
reducing the indirect emissions from nevescorvo
increased waste rock being transported out of the mines
at nevescorvo and aguablanca resulted in increased
direct emissions
most of the co2 emitted in the production of concentrate
is from indirect emissions from the generation of electrical
power supplied through the national grid the major
influence is the grid efficiency factor for the generation of
power for example zinkgruvan derives its power from
electricity generated from hydroelectric sources while
the other operations derive their electrical power from
fossilfuel burning power stations other influences on the
amount of carbon dioxide produced relate to the mining
method
greenhouse gas intensity is calculated by measurement
of fuel used in transport and production and the amount
of explosive used co2 emissions factors are applied
for indirect emissions nationally provided efficiency
factors for electricity production are used the amount
of co2 associated with our activities is normalized to
tonnes of concentrate produced overall ghg intensity
increased slightly over 2009 due to fixed energy
requirements

potential financial implications of
climate change
risks and opportunities associated with climate change
particularly those with significant potential financial
implications at our southern european operations have
been explicitly considered the potential influence of
these changes on our operations is described below
the nevescorvo underground mine is located in a
semiarid region in southern portugal the mine has a
positive water balance and during the winter months
the site discharges water while the site had previously
considered the possibility of becoming a zero discharge
facility the regional changes in rainfall over the past two    nevescorvo is situated in the mediterranean
years has rendered this objective no longer feasible           oak forest biome  a region where biodiversity is
                                                                threatened by climate change
reduced rainfall and increased evaporation in the
summer months will likely result in a drop in water level
at the santa clara reservoir which is a source of clean
process water for the mine demands on the diminished
resource by other users of the reservoir may result in
reduced access by nevescorvo while the longterm
prediction is for reduced annual rainfall in southern
portugal heavy rainfall events are expected with
increased frequency during the winter months
the aguablanca openpit mine with an estimated
remaining mine life of just over 5 years is located in an
arid region of southern spain north of sevilla the mine is
designed to be a zero water discharge facility observed
changes and longterm forecasts are for significantly
reduced rainfall and higher evaporation rates this will        solar panels installed at nevescorvo
result in greater pressure being placed on available water
supplies by all users in the region including agricultural
and municipal users this may create difficulties for the
mine to ensure sufficient access to water to operate
the mill reduced rainfall may also affect mine site
restoration activities by inhibiting the growth of plant
covers on reclaimed areas and waste rock piles as with
nevescorvo while overall precipitation will decline
the increased frequency of extreme rainfall events in
the winter months in the iberian peninsula may cause
accumulation of water in the pit which could affect
mine production this situation was experienced in the
winter of 200910 causing pit flooding as well as the first
snowfall in the area in 50 years
indirect consequences of climate change or legislation
designed to limit its effects such as requirements for
participation in emissions trading systems or other
political influences remain uncertain at this time and are
being tracked closely

zinkgruvan
zinkgruvan has experienced increasing energy costs
over the past several years due to increased production
and the increasing cost of fuel and electricity the site
has plans to engage consultants in 2011 to develop an
energy use reduction plan including reduction targets


galmoy
in late 2009 a project task team was formed involving all
departments at galmoy mine to focus on energy saving          variable speed control on the ag mill at zinkgruvan
throughout the site                                          installed previously helped increase throughput and
the project commenced with the installation of an             decreased electricity use per tonnes of ore milled
energy monitoring system which recorded realtime
energy consumption capable of discriminating between
underground and surface area power use which enabled
high consumption areas to be identified as priorities for
action
underground energysaving initiatives were shown to
present the highest cost savings opportunities most
of the energy used underground goes to ventilate the
mine workings and to pump water from the mine the
main extraction fans ventilating the working ore bodies
were turned off during weekends and nonshift times

water management availability use
recycling and discharge
large volumes of water are used in the extraction and
processing of minerals and metals a key operational
issue is the design and planning of facilities to provide
sufficient water to support our mining operations water
is scarce and competition among users for access to
water is significant in the regions in which we mine in
portugal and spain at lundin mining we plan in order
to balance our operational needs with the needs of local
communities while recognizing potential impacts on
sensitive ecosystems


water availability
water management has become an increasingly important
concern for our southern european operations for the
past two winters we have experienced considerably            the oeiras river near nevescorvo
greater rainfall than has been usual we must consider
that this trend may continue the table below showing
rainfall at aquablanca in each of the seasons since 2005      sources of water and points discharge

water use and recycling
in 2010 our fresh water use totaled an estimated 44
million cubic metres a decrease of 10 from 2009 our
sites used between 44 and 70 of recycled water
in their mill and concentrator processes in 2010  very
similar to the levels in 2009


water use intensity
water use intensity measured as litres of water used per
tonne of concentrate produced shows an overall increase
in 2010 attributable to increased mine dewatering and
reduced levels of concentrate production


water discharges
our environmental management systems are designed to
protect natural water sources we actively monitor water
quality to ensure that any offsite discharges do not adversely
affect the environment we additionally treat waste water
to remove potentially harmful substances such as metals
nitrogen compounds sulphates or suspended solids
treated mine effluent from nevescorvo is discharged
into the oeiras river the discharge is suspended
between the beginning of june and the end of november
when there is a very low flow or no flow in the river there
were occasionally exceedances in ph total nitrogen

and occasionally suspended solids has been observed
at the point of discharge but the water quality quickly
recovers while these permit limits were exceeded at
nevescorvo biological effects monitoring in the oeiras
river shows that there has not been an adverse effect
on the environment this has been helped by the mines
practice of not discharging during the low flows of the
summer months
as a consequence of abnormally high rainfall
experienced in the winter months in the past two years
galmoy experienced difficulty coping with the volume
of discharge of mine water and with the management of
water onsite discharge from the tailings management
facility tmf was stopped because of high nitrite and
ammonia levels in the water in the tailings the high
levels were the result of the mill that reduced nitrite
levels being taken out of operation and also possibly a
result of decomposition of compost in the tailings cover

zinkgruvan
the primary focus of zinkgruvans biodiversity activities
has been on the biological health of lake vattern which
had historically been used by previous mine owners to
dump tailings from the mine while this practice ceased
decades ago zinkgruvan continues monitoring the lake
for water quality
an ecosystem inventory was undertaken in areas
where zinkgruvan plans to build a new tailings pond in
2017the inventory identified four redlisted species
including a fungus that grows under tall trees a fungus
that lives on dead wood lichen that grow on spruce
branches and three varieties of moss these findings          regular water monitoring of lake vattern is conducted
will be considered in the tailings design process            by zinkgruvan environmental staff

the priority in the aguablanca biodiversity action plan is
a restoration plan for forest areas disturbed by mining
the objective of the plan is to reestablish a cover of
native vegetation with major elements being holm oak
quercus ilex and cork oak quercus suber both typical
trees of mediterranean forest progressive rehabilitation
of waste rock dumps affords an opportunity to re
vegetate them with local wildflowers or other vegetation
providing habitat for songbirds and insects
a nursery was created in 2004 as part of the commitments
made in the mines environmental impact assessment

it is clear from longterm trends that there has been an
accumulation of heavy metals in the sediments at the
discharge point and downstream and that these are
elevated in comparison to baseline and control sites
however there is no discernable impact on the fauna
and flora of the sites the fish populations remain healthy
and invertebrate populations important indicators of

a regular survey of birds found on and around its tailings
impoundments the tailings provide a variety of habitats
not commonly found in the interior of ireland and which
attract bird communities especially as resting areas

the importance of this extraordinary diversity of birdlife
has been considered in the closure plan for the tailings
facility the tailings will support pasture in keeping with
the local land use pattern the pasture will be broken up
by hedgerows made up of local species which will provide
habitat for birds and small mammals a water catchment
area will be retained adjacent to the tailings area which is
expected to be attractive to waders and wildfowl

waste management
our operations have waste management plans that
describe how to handle hazardous waste non
hazardous waste and minespecific waste and specify
which contractor to contact for disposal plans also include
actions for minimizing waste and improving recycling
the main classes of hazardous waste produced at our
operations include used oil and oil filters grease used
reagents other chemical products such as paints and
laboratory reagents used batteries and worn tires from
mobile equipment
minespecific waste includes used mining equipment
and resin plastic some waste is kept underground
but all hazardous waste municipal waste and organic
waste is brought to surface and disposed of or recycled
in accordance with waste regulations and site waste
management plans
the amount of waste produced in 2010 was lower than
2009 but site cleanup programs to improve safety and
productivity at the mines particularly nevescorvo
continued to generate significant amounts of non
hazardous waste

tailings management
active tailings impoundments represent one of the
larger environmental risks for the mining industry
and in keeping with better practice lundin mining
takes considerable care to ensure tailings facilities are
well designed built to exacting standards are well
maintained and are monitored carefully tailings facilities
are managed in accordance with international standards
and standards in the national jurisdiction


nevescorvo
at nevescorvo the tailings management system
incorporates requirements from the eu mine safety                  the tailings dam at nevescorvo is equipped with a
directive international commission of large dams                  considerable amount of monitoring instrumentation to
icold and portuguese national legislation                       check its stability and performance

nevescorvo is employing innovative paste tailings
technology to manage its tailings paste tailings are
tailings that have been significantly dewatered and can
be stacked so that they take up significantly less volume
in the tailings management facility the tailings disposal
system at nevescorvo has provided safe and reliable
storage of tailings but based on lifeofmine plans the
tailings facility only has capacity for continued sub
aqueous deposition until the first quarter of 2011 the
solution to the capacity problem was to develop and
implement innovative paste tailings technology
paste tailings therefore obviate the need to raise the height
of the dam create a more secure tailings facility and reduce
the environmental footprint of the mine the thickened and
dewatered tailings provide a more stable material that
can be piled on top of the existing tailings deposits the         internal berms are constructed of waste rock to retain
mounds of paste tailings are retained by berms inside the          paste tailings
tailings basin constructed of mine waste rock



paste tailings have a number of environmental advantages
    water that would have been disposed of in the                  there is a reduced risk of environmental damage
 		 tailings pond can be redirected as process water            		 as there is little or no water to aid the transport of
 		 reducing water use intensity                                		 the tailings if an embankment breach should occur
    water storage and retaining ponds can be reduced               seepage of contaminated water from the stored
 		 or even eliminated                                          		 paste tailings is reduced or eliminated the volume
    tailings may be deposited at higher slope angles            		 of tailings that needs to be stored is further reduced
 		 which reduces the footprint of the facility for the          		 by removing as much as possible underground to

lundin mining is currently managing two closed
mines the storliden mine in northern sweden was
closed in 2008 in 2009 all waste rock was disposed
of underground the drift sealed and surface structures
removed cleanup of the surface areas and some re
vegetation were undertaken in 2010 the last stage in
the remediation program is to reforest the mine site and
the area surrounding the vent shaft this was originally
planned for the spring of 2010 but a prolonged winter and
the consequent late thaw necessitated a postponement
to 2011
the las vueltas mine in honduras was acquired by
lundin mining as part of the rio narcea purchase in
july 2007 this open pit heap leach gold mine operated
between 2001 and 2004 some remediation work had
been done prior to the acquisition of the site by lundin        aguablanca maintains a nursery to grow oak trees to
mining but further work was required                           be used in site restoration on closure
a closure plan was presented to the honduran
government in late 2010 the plan includes drainage
and covering of process ponds and the construction of
a new passive water treatment system to manage acid
rock drainage from the pit the waste rock dumps will
be recontoured to improve stability and will be covered
with soil mixed with carbonate rock to assist with acid
neutralization work is expected to proceed in 2011
once final regulatory approval is received
active reclamation is also underway at galmoy where
mining activity continues although the process plant has
been closed and dismantled in 2008 galmoy mines ltd
entered into discussions with all stakeholders including
government ministries local councils and environmental
groups to agree a planned and comprehensive closure             a closure plan for the las vueltas mine in honduras is

a similar clinic is maintained at zinkgruvan the site
maintains a medical surveillance program with all
employees seeing the nurse and physician on a three
year cycle vision hearing and lung function are tested
along with lifestyle counseling employees exposed to
dust receive a chest xray every six years
at the smaller aguablanca mine medical assessments
are conducted annually by an outside service provider
using exposurebased protocols workplace exposures
are also assessed by an outside consultant
at each mine site lundin mining has training counseling
prevention and riskcontrol programs in place to assist
workforce and their family members with health and
safety concerns public health resources in the countries
where we currently operate are of a high standard and
are readily accessible for community members


safety performance
lundin mining tracks safety performance at the
corporate level maintains statistics on and reports to
the board of directors all incidents that result in lost
time from work or which require medical aid according
to the us osha criteria this total recordable incident
frequency allows comparison of performance between
operations in different parts of the world where different
social support systems or workers compensation
requirements may distort an indicator based only on
lost time incidents statistics are normalized to 200000
hours of work
safety performance in 2010 remained much the same
as in 2009 with a trif of 355 compared with a trif
of 312 in 2009 note that in reporting safety statistics
lundin mining does not differentiate between fulltime
staff and contractors
efforts were made to bring about a culture of change
at the sites that would establish an environment that
would drive improved safety performance for example
at nevescorvo considerable improvements have
been made to site infrastructure to enhance safety as
well as productivity the mine is moving from anfo to
emulsions explosives which have less environmental
impact and are easier to handle new secure storage
facilities have been constructed underground that are
easy to maintain and are well illuminated
