                                                         our corporate culture requires decisionmaking that is shaped by longterm
                                            thinking even as a publicly listed company bucher has never given precedence to shortterm
                                            solutions but always favoured an evenhanded approach taking all stakeholders interests
                                            into account our aim is to ensure dynamic development of our businesses but with a solid
                                            foundation and a long perspective that is why we see sustainability as a matter of balancing
                                            economic and social requirements and the conservation of natural resources for us there
                                            is no inherent contradiction in this ambitious and challenging goal
                                                         for generations we have pursued a sustainable approach to corporate man
                                            agement nonetheless the present report is only the second to be published by bucher
                                            in comparison with 2011 most of the key indicators are little changed this is a notable
                                            trend in itself since group sales for 2012 were 12 higher than the previous year
                                            yet energy consumption across the group rose by only 2 and co² emissions by 1 while
                                            the figures for water consumption and waste water usage were actually lower we will
                                            need to conduct analyses over several years to understand more clearly the context and
                                            the factors influencing the trend in the environmental indicators a simple comparison
                                            of the rise or fall in energy consumption from one year to the next is of limited value
                                                         first conclusions can be drawn from the data already collected changes
                                          in energy consumption at certain production sites in countries with energy resources that
                                          produce a lot of co² have a disproportionate impact that is why co² emissions showed
                                          a less marked rise than energy consumption one clear and welcome finding is the im
                                          provement in accident rates at our plants our employees have been involved in various
                                          initiatives and preventive measures as part of sustainability projects both internally
                                           and externally you will learn more about these on the following pages
                                                         sustainability reporting is on the one hand part of our accountability to
                                           stakeholder groups and the interested public at the same time we are aware that careful
                                           use of resources sensitive management of personnel prudent selection of suppliers and
                                           good relations with our customers and the wider community are important factors in
                                           improving competitiveness and thereby the longterm success of our group and we
                                            act accordingly

                there are also global trends which by their very nature influence our business
   and therefore the challenges facing sustainable corporate management for example
   the demographic trends affecting personnel at our sites and the strong growth of population
   in certain parts of the world which set new challenges for our products in particular
   agricultural machinery to meet the demands of global population growth agriculture
    has to achieve a massive increase in yield per hectare otherwise more people will face
    starvation however the trend towards costeffective spacesaving technologies that
    make sparing use of resources is one that affects all buchers divisions products and pro
 duction processes sustainability reporting along with the gathering of data and
 subsequent evaluation is a valuable tool for the ongoing development of our company
                these considerations are part of our internal dialogue already during the
  preparation of the first report more than 50 managers from across the group took part
  in a workshop at which we discussed and defined issues and questions on the theme
  of sustainability in the bucher group the great commitment of all concerned is one
  reason for the high quality of the data resources the results from the second report
  which covers data for 2011 and 2012 were discussed again with the same management
  personnel with a particular emphasis on further development of the analysis and
  conclusions a process that is very much in the spirit of our longterm orientation

  half of all the fossil fuels consumed in the farming industry are used to run equipment and    customers
  tractors a further major factor influencing fuel consumption is the way the machinery
  is used in practice
                  by way of orientation kuhn group launched an information campaign in 2012
  as part of this initiative the company published a customer brochure with the motto
  forty tips for saving fuel the aim of the attractive 50page publication which is packed
  with practical information and explanations about the product range is to upgrade the
  knowledge of all concerned the goal is to save fuel while taking into account the technical
  demands as well as the economic objectives of the farmers
                  the right user attitude begins with selecting a level of engine power that
  corresponds to the actual requirements and ends with correct maintenance of parts subject
   to wear and tear to achieve that the tractor and the agricultural machinery must be
   carefully matched and the overall weight distribution of the combination optimised
    another consideration often underestimated but very important in practice is getting

     reduce fuel consumption by up to 15

            welcome days for executives
            and specialists
               those who took part are still buzzing with enthusiasm for them the welcome     the great asset of the
   days event was an allround success they experienced at first hand the real effort         welcome days is the
bucher hydraulics is making to introduce new management talent to its corporate culture
thirty committed specialists and executives from europe china and the usa attended
                                                                                                 composition of the group
the divisions first welcome days event the idea behind the fourday gettogether was to       with many different
give newly recruited managers an insight into bucher hydraulics strategy vision and           nationalities and areas
culture as well as its products methods and core processes and also to establish a basis     of activity represented
 for common understanding and facilitate networking at management level
               there were good reasons for introducing the welcome days bucher hydraulics
                                                                                                as well as a wide range
 is growing developing new markets and opening production sites on four continents             of views
 e xpansion also entails growing challenges for managers and specialists in divisional
  companies and centres of expertise one of the skills they need is an ability to adapt to
   other cultures and lead international project teams across cultural and departmental
   boundaries they also have to deal with regional differences in customer requirements
   taking people make the difference as its guiding principle bucher hydraulics decided
   to make an investment and developed the format for the annual welcome days apart
   from presentations and group projects the programme includes a hiking tour and an
   evening gathering with an opportunity to meet division president daniel weller in an
   informal setting
               the four days welcome days event took place in switzerland and germany
   in 2012 the choice of venue was no accident the divisions biggest plants are located in
   these two countries together they generate around half of bucher hydraulics sales

                                                   tempered glass bottles a milestone
                                                   for the packaging industry
tempered flat glass                                  glass is a valuable recyclable material that has fascinated man for thousands
has been used to make                  of years every year more than 250 billion glass containers are manufactured worldwide
                                       the risks for health are minimal since glass is manufactured from natural raw materials

ceed in developing                                   a unique process developed by emhart glass with worldwide patent protection
                                        enables manufacturers to make much more stable glass bottles so they can either be
a glass for containers                  made more robust to withstand rough handling or considerably lighter this means the
that is on a par with                   amount of glass required to manufacture tempered glass containers is much lower than
flat safety glass                      for conventional glass packaging extensive laboratory testing of tempered glass bottles
                                        yielded encouraging results containers made from tempered glass are suitable not only
                                        as disposable bottles but also very good as returnable bottles
                                                     to temper the glass containers they are heated to about 700 c then subjected
                                        to rapid controlled cooling inside and outside this produces mechanical stresses of
                                        around 50 mpa on the inner and outer surfaces and tensile stresses of a similar magnitude
                                        on the inside the result is a more stable glass container reflected in a 3050 increase
                                        in burst pressure
                                                     from mid2013 the new process will enter the commercial sphere for the first
                                        time through collaboration with vetropack an innovationdriven customer which will
                                        start industrial production at its factory in pöchlarn austria if the commercialisation of

      stems and if their integrity is not preserved herbaceous flavours can find their way in the

      grape juice another consideration is that today the fruit is often harvested at a very late          the gentle process leaves
      stage of ripening that makes the grape skins more fragile gentle hygienic separation                 berries undamaged
      of the grapes from the stems is therefore of prime importance                                         reduces power and water
                      bucher vaslin is making headlines with a completely new destemming process
      based on oscillating motions of the separator basket the delta oscillys has received
                                                                                                              consumption and also
      several awards for its sophisticated technology which subjects the grapes to less mechanical          offers an outstanding
       stress and conserves the fruit potential                                                              priceperformance ratio
                      the patented process leaves the berry as intact as possible and releases less juice
       and green material during destemming the berries are separated from the stems by means
       of a wide oscillatory motion of one or two baskets depending on the model the machine
       takes advantage of the fact that the berries have a higher moment of inertia than the stems
       the mass of the grapes is increased artificially by acceleration until the critical speed for
       destemming is reached separation is brought about by stopping the stems on a perforated
       surface the size of the perforations can be varied to fit the grape variety being processed
                      the results speak for themselves the berries and stems are completely
       separated in two different ways the berries also pass through a calibrator where any
        remaining green parts are removed the throughput volume of the machine can be
         adjusted to as much as 16 tonnes an hour the destemmer is very simple to operate
     so it conserves energy bucher vaslins engineers were able to dispense with the usual
     retaining tank which means the machine can be cleaned very quickly reducing water
      consumption and the burden on the waste water system
