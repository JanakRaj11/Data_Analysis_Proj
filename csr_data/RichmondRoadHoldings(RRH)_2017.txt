hopes that by exposing students to a diverse array of nutritious
and flavorful foods and by bringing awareness to urban farmings
environmental benefits they will be encouraged to make healthy
choices for their bodies and for their communities


the 8 x 12 shipping container kitchen that richmond road holdings sponsored
hosts most of the cooking activities on the farm and is fitted out with windows
doors a sink lots of storage and tables or countertops on which everyone can
prep cook and eat  an awning has been added to the outside of the container
to give some additional sheltered area for students to gather under


grownyc replaced the old roof and added a green roof on which to grow sedum moss and lettuce greens  
excess rainwater is diverted from the container and awning into a nearby rain garden


as well as the outdoor kitchen the garden features over 20 vegetable beds made from recycled plastic lumber
a gourd tunnel fruit trees and a bean teepee
