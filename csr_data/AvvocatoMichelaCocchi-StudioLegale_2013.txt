as a social principle for economic activity

                           ceo statement

the 20122011 cop is being released amid a long period of economic
uncertainty the tentative recovery that seemed to be gaining ground during
2010 and the first half of 2011 has given way to renewed concerns the global
economy faces a number of significant and interrelated challenges that could
hamper a genuine upturn after an economic crisis half a decade long in much of
the world especially in the most advanced economies
the persisting financial difficulties in the euro zone have led to a longlasting and
unresolved sovereign debt crisis that has reached the boiling point
this development is coupled with the risk of a weak recovery in several other
advanced economies outside of europe  notably in the united states where
political gridlock on fiscal tightening could dampen the growth outlook
furthermore given the expected slowdown in economic growth in china india
and other emerging markets reinforced by a potential decline in global trade and
volatile capital flows it is not clear which regions can drive growth and
employment creation in the short to medium term
policymakers are struggling to find ways to cooperate and manage the current
economic challenges while preparing their economies to perform well in an
increasingly difficult and unpredictable global landscape amid the shortterm
crisis management it remains critical to establish the fundamentals that underpin
economic growth and development for the longer term3

law is an arena in which fundamental questions about the nature of rights and
justice confront the realities of the social world it is the challenge of bringing rights
and realities together that draws us to the practice of law and to the study of law in
action
how can we devise a system of justice that better realizes the ideals of the rule of
law
the real measure of our success is the impact we have in advancing the
understanding and improvement of the legal system
i already was privileged to be part of our firms transition that allowed us to
proactively participate in the ungc
during 20122011 period i have felt proud we have fulfilled the requirements of
meeting the 24 criteria for the advanced level this has involved focusing upon
the power related to our lawyers activity our calling as lawyers to do good works

pursuit of independence research of transparency and generation of trust would
not have been possible and would not be possible without the contribution of all our
stakeholders we thank them
nevertheless we have to say that there remains a lot to be done agreeing as an
organisation to increase the momentum and take practical steps within our
corporate citizenship
in this regard we want us to remain at the forefront of the international agenda our
20122015 action plan is conceived as a response to the international
development upon which it is based

it is a part of our responsibility to address ungc principles issue within the
combined framework of the uns new guiding principles on business adopted
unanimously by the un human rights council last june 2011 the revised oecd
guidelines for responsible business conduct by multinational enterprises launched
at the same time and the european commissions new csr strategy launched
on 2011 october 25th
so we express our continued support for the global compact renewing our
ongoing commitment to the initiative and its principles
our cop reflects our story our vision
as a private business not traded on any stock exchange with no requirement to
disclose data and not scrutinized on a regular basis by analysts and investors this
report is a statement of our quality our transparency and our leading position in
the market

we around the world

                               enhancing a global framework

                        setting goals and monitoring progress

a separate and important lesson from the mdgs is
that progress towards inclusive equitable and
sustainable development requires a process of regular
dialogue and negotiation ensuring the participation
and commitment of stakeholders from governments
parliamentarians and local authorities the private
sector trade unions civil society and academia is
critical to make the process as inclusive transparent
and effective as possible4

         for us embedding human rights and ungc
principles in business is no more an optional policy
choice or a gesture of charity it has become an
instrument to give legitimacy to the investments of our
clients and ours and protect them5

       our programmes emphasise ungc principles
that within their sphere of influence businesses should
support and respect

within these programmes and services the inclusion
of media government and ngos creates a network
not only for support but also for constructive critique
and improvement that differentiates the strategic use
of corporate social responsibility from general
philantropy

pink is not a color just for
girls

trovo una regula universalissima
la qual mi par valer circa questo
in tutte le cose umane che si facciano o dicano più che alcun altra
e cioè fuggir quanto più si po
e come un asperissimo e pericoloso scoglio
la affettazione
e per dir forse una nova parola usar in ogni cosa una certa sprezzatura
che nasconda larte e dimostri ciò che si fa e dice
venir fatto senza fatica e quasi senza pensarvi
da questo credo io che derivi assai la grazia
perché delle cose rare e ben fatte ognun sa la difficultà
onde in esse la facilità genera grandissima maraviglia
e per lo contrario il sforzare e come si dice tirar per i capegli
dà somma disgrazia e fa estimar poco ogni cosa
per grande chella si sia
però si po dire quella essere vera arte che non pare essere arte
né più in altro si ha da poner studio che nella nasconderla
perché se è scoperta leva in tutto il credito e fa lomo poco estimato

we want us to remain at the forefront of the international csr agenda
our 20122015 action plan should be viewed as a response to the
international development upon which it is based


2011
uns new guiding principles on business and human rights
oecd guidelines for responsible business conducted by multinational
enterprises
eu commissions new csr strategy

we have tackled priority areas that are central to
corporate leadership today and essential for the
transformation to sustainable markets

within the international framework very few economic
sectors have revealed as much economic potential as
the cultural and creative industriesccis have over the
past few years

cerisier en fleur  cherry blossom law initiative is an
expression we coined to refer to our activities devoted to
ccis

ccis sector presents huge opportunities

 the global demand for cultural content needs to be
satisfied

 the development of a creative economy demands the
adoption of appropriate support policies for ccsmes
that should be commensurate with their significant
contribution to the economy

 ccis development at international level serves the
promotion of cultural diversity in a globalised world
promoting the intercultural dialogue and mutual
understanding

there is no       consensus     on   what    ccis   field
encompasses

we refer to the so called fame industries

nations are reexamining the relationship between law and creativity
within which intellectual propertyip and gender parity issues gain
characteristic momentum on the global stage

the most important determinant of a countrys competitiveness is its
human talent  the skills education and productivity of its workforce
and women account for onehalf of the potential talent base throughout
the world while closing gender gaps is a matter of human rights and
equity it is also one of efficiency there is new research on the
growing power of the purse and how this will be among the drivers of
growth in the postcrisis economy the combined impact of growing
gender equality the emerging middle class and womens spending
priorities will lead to rising household savings rates and shifting
spending patterns that are likely to benefit sectors such as among
others ccis

               our three major objectives
              that together form a strategy


     promotion of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue

          promotion of culture as a catalyst for creativity

lady lawyer
        and

what does lady lawyer mean during these extraordinary
years the problem of false equal opportunities is still unsolved
even in the practice of law lady lawyer in american world of
legal profession is an expression that is often used by lawyers
mostly male to refer to women in the profession yet lawyers who
happen to be men are almost never referred to male lawyers it
is the challenge of lady lawyer that simply meets us during our
professional journey accompanying us on the way sharing our
dreams our values our targets and helping us to achieve them
assert them and reach them




lady lawyer is a registered trade mark


thats what i thought the most common event becomes an
adventure simply narrating it
lady lawyer magazine 2006 issue 0 avvocatomichelacocchi

during narration an event is turned into an adventure due to the
creative power of words and the temporal sequence of narration 
which does not start from the beginning as it seems but from the
end  giving words the emphasis and value of a beginning

during narration in fact the events are ordered in the inverted
sense compared to their occurrence imposing a beginning and an
end upsetting reality

you have to choose between living and narrating

lady lawyer therefore does not narrate but lives

unlike narration lady lawyer has no beginning because she has
not established the end

starting from 2006 lady lawyer has established a dialogue on
lawyers life and work an intimate and relentless dialogue taking
root in the fertile and rich ground of our professional life

     the global competitiveness index framework5

cr

     we define sustainable competitiveness as the set of organizations policies
     and factors that make an entity remain productive over the longer term while
     ensuring social and environmental sustainability7

     fundamental to this concept is the notion that while competitiveness can be
     equated with productivity and economic performance sustainable
     competitiveness can be linked to a broader concept that focuses on aspects
     that go beyond mere economic performance to include other important
     elements that render entities sustainable by ensuring highquality growth

cr
 1   since its introduction in 2005

     coherently with our cluster and networking development structure see sub
     criterion 2

     we have used the wef world economic forum gci global competitiveness
     index to benchmark our competitiveness all along the different territories we
     operate

     the clear and intuitive structure of the gci framework is useful for prioritizing
     policy reforms because it allows us to identify the strengths and weaknesses of
     our competitiveness environment

     the gci also provides us a platform for dialogue with our stakeholders
     government other business and civil society

     based on the definition of sustainable competitiveness as above

     according to the wef global competitiveness report 20122013

     we have also developed a framework that aims to create a common ground to
     develop internal policies that balance economic results with social inclusion and
     environmental stewardship

     within this framework the wefgci is adjusted by factors that encompass social
     and environmental sustainability opting for the simple approach of defining a
     linear relationship among the three dimensions

     implementation of the following suggested
                   best practice

      corporate governance structure board of directors or
      equivalent and its role in oversight of corporate
      sustainability implementation in line with global
      compact principles

cr
 2   since our foundation in the mid1990s our governance has been modeled
     after the cnd cluster and network development


     according to unido united nations industrial development organization
     definition

     clusters are sectoral and geographical concentrations of enterprises that
     produce and sell a range of related or complementary products and thus
     face common challenges and opportunities these concentrations can give
     rise to external economies such as emergence of specialized suppliers of raw
     materials and components or growth of a pool of sectorspecific skills and
     foster development of specialized services in technical managerial and
     financial matters

     networks are groups of firms that cooperate on a joint development project
     complementing each other and specializing in order to overcome common
     problems achieve collective efficiency and penetrate markets beyond their
     individual reach networks can be developed within or independently of
     clusters

cr
 2
     our approach is based on the assumption that msmes micro small and
     medium enterprises play a key role in terms of employment and income
     generation and that their development is often hampered by their isolation



     accordingly to unido clusters  networks development programme to
     achieve this aim two main elements

     a technical cooperation in formulating and implementing cnd initiatives that
     generates pilot projects in the territories we operate
     b upscaling cnd efforts through institutional capacitybuilding and policy
     advice with a view to fostering the dissemination of cnd policies on the
     regional or national scales

     an additional noteworthy feature of our cnd projects is their heavy reliance on
     local expertise with international expertise involvement invoked primarily in the
     startup phase and gradually reduced over time

cr              focus of our cnd projects

                         is on

                forming social capital

                    that can provide

                      the glue
     between groups of entrepreneurs in clusters

            while later serving as a lubricant
               to stimulate development
      of new business relationships in value chains

cr
     our cnd programme is characterized by a continuous effort to develop and
 2   refine intervention methods grounded in theories pertaining to business
     linkages but equally important in a detailed understanding of what works based
     on fieldlevel project experience

     accordingly unido methodology ours is based on the following steps
     cluster selection which entails the identification of the clusters to be assisted
     diagnostic study an actionoriented analysis of strengths weaknesses
     opportunities and threats of the clusters
     vision building and action planning which refers to the formulation of a vision
     and a corresponding development strategy shared by the entire cluster
     implementation ie the management and coordination of the activities outlined
     in the action plan including the establishment of horizontal and vertical networks
     monitoring  evaluation me of the qualitative and quantitative outcomes of
     the project


     this methodology helps trigger the process of cluster development to make it
     sustainable over time we work with local institutions strengthening their capacity
     to assume leadership of the process and support cluster firms in their future
     endeavors

     through networking individual local firms can address the problems related to
     their size and improve their competitiveness being in the best position to help
     each other

     through horizontal cooperation ie with other firms occupying the same position in
     the value chain firms can collectively achieve scale economies beyond the reach
     of individual firms

     through vertical cooperation with other smes as well as with largescale
     enterprises along the value chain firms can specialize on their core business and
     give way to an external division of labour

     interfirm cooperation also gives rise to a collective learning space an invisible
     college where ideas are exchanged and developed and knowledge shared in a
     collective attempt to improve product quality and occupy more profitable market
     segments

     lastly networking among firms local policy makers can help to shape a shared
     local development vision and give strength to collective actions to enhance
     entrepreneurial strategies

     lessons learned

     the experiences gained during five years of our involvement in networkcluster
         related projects permit certain conclusions to be drawn
     the following six lessons learned represent a selection of some observations
         that may prove useful in designing future projects

     1   demand orientation in our experience project strategies must be flexible
          and vary from network to network and from cluster to cluster one important
          requirement is that the intervention must be designed after a thorough
          analysis of the needs of the initiative and the surrounding economic
          environment from which resources can be tapped to satisfy those needs
          demand orientation is not passive but proactive


     three principles guide our work with respect to networks namely they need to
         be
     a business oriented
     b productiongrounded
     c targeted at smes

cr

     2   business oriented business orientation refers essentially to two
          components firstly networking must aim at visible improvements in the
          economic situation and prospects of participating firms and secondly it
          must grant the group a new competitive advantage which they alone could
          not reach production grounded the second principle points to the
          importance of process and product innovation and structural improvement
          supporting a network therefore should involve not only the search for new
          market opportunities but also provide the assistance required to restructure
          the networks production organization to respond to new markets in a timely
          manner with the right quantities and quality targeted at smes the third
          principle refers to the fact that even though networks may involve other
          partners the primary beneficiaries need to be the small andor medium
          firms

cr

     3   multidimension networking is a multidimensional concept and does not
          apply only to business institutional networking networking between the
          private and public sectors and country networking are equally important
          concepts in our activities the idea is to specialize and cooperate to the
          maximum extent so that each actor in the economic system can dedicate
          itself to core functions and perform them to the best of his or her abilities in
          practice this principle translates into the natural evolution of the networking
          units which specialize into strategic functions decentralizing the
          implementation functions after an initial period when they centralize them

cr

     4 people involved the key resource in networking initiatives is the people
         involved with this in mind it is important to distinguish four factors that
         can increase the likelihood of project success peoples ownership
         empowerment skills and incentives at all levels the project actors must
         a own the project and feel it is in their interest to execute it to this end
         it is important to invest adequately in raising awareness at all levels to
         involve local actors in project design and encourage their continual
         feedback for improving project implementation b be empowered to act in
         other words all the actors involved must have the leverage credibility and
         resources to play their role c have the right skills to act in addition to an
         appropriate academic and professional background the skills of network
         participants must encompass such invaluable extracurricular skills such
         as the capacity to build teams deep knowledge of local social rules and
         an openness to establish contacts d have the right motivation and
         incentives our experience indicates that appropriate incentive schemes
         can enhance participants motivation and channel their efforts into projects
         that hold the possibility of higher impact and longerterm gains for the
         networks the incentives must be anchored not only to financial
         performance of the networks but to more comprehensive criteria involving
         qualitative assessment being made based on the achievement of the
         objectives indicated in the agreed work plans

     5 training and exposure to best practices in our experience the kind of
         training that has emerged as valuable and effective in transferring
         knowledge on the nuts and bolts of networking is to rely heavily on
         concrete cases of successful networks and clusters and let networking
         agents hear directly from other agents who have implemented successful
         networking projects to this end accordingly to unido framework we have
         developed the concept of joint learning programmes aimed at giving first
         hand exposure to cluster and network agents to successful experiences in
         addition to this specific training a series of working tools are also being
         systematized to facilitate the work of the network participants and
         accelerate the transfer of knowledge to new networking agents other
         instruments are being developed such as a practical manual for network
         members and a set of monitoring and evaluation indicators for networking
         projects all these instruments are constantly evolving and are meant to
         stimulate creative thinking rather than impose rigid boundaries

     6 no single and predefined path lastly there is no single and predefined
         path to be followed in the implementation of clusternetwork promotion
         initiatives that can be effortlessly replicated across countries andor
         regions these initiatives need to be flexible and in tune with the
         characteristics of the environment where we operate a bottomup
         approach centred on fostering an entrepreneurial vision and supporting
         local actors initiatives to realize it appears to be the best in our
         experience

                the uia  union internationale des avocats
                 turin principles of professional conduct
                          for the legal profession
                             in the 21st century

     according to the resolution adopted by the general assembly of the uia 
     union internationale des avocats held in sydney on october 27th 2002

                            the principles state as follows

cr
     whereas there is a diversity of views of the lawyers role in a wide range of
 2   political social and cultural contexts
     whereas although economic development and advances in communication and
     information technology have required those who render services in related areas
     to work together and cooperate in new ways they must still follow the basic
     principles which govern them in advising and defending their clients both in their
     own countries and on an international level
     whereas regardless of differing geographic and economic contexts the lawyer
     continues to play a fundamental role in the defence of human rights be they civil
     political economic social or cultural in nature
     whereas that role is played not only in the courts but also privately as an
     advisor in order to
      ensure that despite the complexity of modern legal systems the rules of law are
     more widely known thereby ensuring that they will be respected and observed
      limit recourse to the courts by discouraging frivolous suits and helping settle
     disputes by first referring the parties to mediation or conciliation
      maintain stability in legal relationships despite an increasing trend toward self
     regulation deregulation and globalisation
     whereas it is necessary to ensure the recognition and continued significance of
     the lawyer role even in the face of pressure from authorities be they executive
     legislative or judicial

     whereas in order to attain this goal it is essential that all states recognise the
     basic principles underlying the legal profession through which despite differences
cr   in culture and development its fundamental characteristics can be distilled and
 2
     rules can be developed to protect and preserve them
     whereas the fundamental principles of the legal profession are set forth in the
     bylaws and codes of the uia and in the basic principles on the role of lawyers
     endorsed by the un general assembly in 1990 according to which
      the lawyer plays an essential role in defending individuals in the courts by
     guaranteeing them an absolute right to the effective assistance of counsel and a
     defence without prejudice or discrimination in complete independence and
     freedom including but not limited to freedom of association religion speech and
     opinion
      the lawyer has both the right and the duty to ensure the spread of the rule of law
     and toparticipate in its development
      the lawyer must practice the profession in a spirit of service and humanism in
     accordance with the code of legal ethics and professional responsibility especially
     the attorneyclient privilege
      the fundamental task of professional associations of lawyers is to ensure
     compliance with the standards and norms governing the practice of law to defend
     their members against any unwarranted interference or restraint to ensure free
     access by all to legal services and to cooperate with all other institutions which
     serve the cause of justice
     whereas the corollary to the lawyers role and rights is the obligation to perform
     the corresponding duties as the said rights and duties are an essential condition of
     the protection of both the public interest and the interests of individuals
     whereas these principles of professional conduct are subject to the laws and rules
     of ethics governing the legal profession

         the union internationale des avocats
         international association of lawyers
               has resolved to adopt these
     principles of conduct for the legal profession

     the lawyers role
     it is the lawyers role to ensure the protection of all persons before the law
cr
 2   lawyers have the right and the duty to practice their profession in a manner that
     furthers knowledge understanding and application of the law whilst protecting
     the interests entrusted to their care

     recognition of the lawyers role
     lawyers are entitled to recognition and protection of their role by society and any
     authority be it legislative executive or judicial as their role must be considered
     an essential instrument in the administration of justice and the organisation of
     society
     lawyers have the duty to do everything in their power to ensure that such
     recognition is preserved by maintaining quality and fairness in rendering their
     services whilst acting in accordance with the highest ethical standards and
     cultural norms
     lawyers must therefore be allowed access by all authorities and governmental
     agencies in each and every case to the clients and documents they need to
     defend the interests entrusted to their care

     independence
     lawyers have the right to practise their profession freely and independently
     without being subjected to pressure or discrimination of any kind whatsoever

     learns in representing a client

     no duty to report
     lawyers should not be compelled to report facts which they discover in practising
     their profession
     where a lawyer learns of an activity that could endanger human life he or she
     must take all precautions to protect that life as permitted by the attorneyclient
     privilege
     whenever a lawyer discovers a criminal or unlawful activity he or she must of
     course refuse to take part in it even then the lawyer should be under no
     obligation to report it to the authorities but rather has the duty to withdraw from the
     matter as soon as the lawyer has grave suspicions that the activity described may
     conceal unlawful acts and that the client does not intend to refrain from that
     activity

cr
 6   the why in summary

     why respect human rights

      we have a responsibility to respect human rights which means to avoid
     infringing on the human rights of others
      to gain commercial benefits associated with good human rights practice


     why develop a human rights policy
cr
 6
      to provide a basis for embedding the responsibility to respect human rights
     through all business functions
      to respond to relevant stakeholder expectations
      to identify policy gaps and initiate a process that alerts our company to new
     areas of human rights risk
      to elaborate on the commitment of ours to support human rights
      to build increased trust with external stakeholders and to start to
     understand and address their concerns
      to foster the development of inhouse learning management capacity and
     leadership on human rights issues
      to demonstrate international good business practice

cr
 6   the how in summary

     getting started  the process behind the policy

      developing a human rights policy is a dynamic though not always a predictable
     process
      assigning senior management responsibility to drive the process
      involving all business operations in policy development implementation and
     reviews
      mapping existing company policies to identify human rights coverage and gaps
cr
      involving crossfunctional personnel in the process to build understanding
 6   knowhow and a sense of common purpose
      consulting internal and external stakeholders to identify and respond to their
     expectations


     what are the key ingredients of a human rights policy

     all policies  whether standalone or integrated  at a minimum comprise
      an explicit commitment to respect all human rights which refers to international
     human rights standards including the universal declaration of human rights
      provisions on labourworkplace rights
      provisions on nonlabour rights these will reflect human rights priorities and
     are likely to be particular to our industryareas of operation

cr
 6   the what in summary

     next steps  path to implementation

      assessing our human rights impacts and risk areas including country
     analyses new operation assessments and stakeholder consultation
      integrating human rights throughout the company looking at training
cr   communication management systems etc
 6    tracking and communicating on performance including by identifying
     progress measurement indicators
      providing for or cooperating in remedying an adverse human rights situation
     that a company has caused or contributed to through legitimate processes
      establishing or participating in effective operationallevel grievance
     mechanisms for individuals and communities that may be adversely affected by
     the companys activities

     questions that have been asked

     do we already have systems on which we may build as we develop our human
     rights due diligence processes

     are these systems effective and fit for the purpose of addressing human rights
     risks
cr
 6
     what changes may be needed to make them fit for this purpose

     are there circumstances in which we will need separate processes for human
     rights

     who should lead on human rights due diligence who needs to have
     oversight

     what departments will most likely need to be involved in aspects of human
     rights due diligence how could we involve them in the development of the
     processes how could we structure and motivate collaboration

cr
 6   the action in summary

     human rights due diligence is at the core of our internal movement for corporate
     accountability thus this standard is increasingly looked to for implementing the
     corporate responsibility to respect human rights

     we have commissioned an internal expert team to formulate us legal and policy
     recommendations on ways to promote due diligence to prevent remedy and
     mitigate adverse human rights impacts

     the expert team will develop a survey methodology survey that will be sent to
     our various operational entities from around the world throughout this research
cr
     process private consultations will be held in various jurisdictions for our experts
 6   to meet with local experts other legal practitioners and civil society leaders
     these consultations enable us to gain valuable inputs into our project to promote
     the findings and to aide in bringing together diverse legal practitioners with local
     ngos

     in doing so they may choose to specify the precise due diligence steps that
     should be taken

     the actions final recommendations will encourage the adoption of best
     practices in current use

     the recommendations will also take into account differences among legal
     systems and cultures varying levels of economic development and other
     distinguishing factors identified in the survey responses

     one of the key challenges of sustainable development is that it demands new and
     innovative choices and ways of thinking

     while developments in knowledge and technology are contributing to economic
     development they also have the potential to help resolve the risks and threats to the
     sustainability of our social relations environment and economies

     new knowledge and innovations in technology management and public policy are
     challenging us  like other organizations  to make new choices in the way our
     operations services and activities impact the earth people and economies
cr

     alongside increasing choice and opportunities will make transparency about economic
     environmental and social impacts a fundamental component in effective stakeholder
     relations investment decisions and other market relations

     to support this expectation and to communicate clearly and openly about sustainability
     we needed a globally shared framework of concepts consistent language and metrics
     consequently we chose the global reporting initiatives gri the mission of which is
     to fulfil this need by providing a trusted and credible framework for sustainability

     our internal so called social sustainability framework articulates our
     strategic commitment to social sustainable development and is an
     integral part of our internal approach to risk management

     the social sustainability framework comprises our policy and
     performance standards on social sustainability and access to
     information policy the policy on social sustainability describes our
cr
10
     commitments roles and responsibilities related to social sustainability
     the access to information policy reflects our commitment to
     transparency and good governance on our operations

     we use the social sustainability framework along with other
     strategies policies and initiatives to direct our business activities in
     order to achieve our overall development objectives

     the specific labour and working conditions performance standard
     provides guidance on how to identify risks and impacts and is
     designed to help avoid mitigate and manage risks and impacts as a
     way of doing business in a sustainable way

     the performance standard establishes standards that we are to meet
     throughout the life of our initiatives and activities as to


cr

                      labour and working conditions

     the labour and working conditions performance standard
     recognizes that the pursuit of economic growth through employment
     creation and income generation should be accompanied by protection
     of the fundamental rights of workers

     for any business the workforce is a valuable asset and a sound
     workermanagement relationship is a key ingredient in the sustainability
     of a company

     failure to establish and foster a sound workermanagement
cr
10   relationship can undermine worker commitment and retention and can
     jeopardize a project

     conversely through a constructive workermanagement relationship
     and by treating the workers fairly and providing them with safe and
     healthy working conditions we may create tangible benefits such as
     enhancement of the efficiency and productivity of their operations

     the requirements set out in the performance standard have been in part
     guided by a number of international conventions and instruments
     including those of the international labour organization ilo and the
     united nations un

     these conventions are
     ilo convention 87 on freedom of association and protection of the
     right to organize
     ilo convention 98 on the right to organize and collective bargaining
     ilo convention 29 on forced labour

     ilo convention 111 on discrimination employment and occupation
