the forestry savings program was the way fibria found to
include rural communities and producers in its business
generating income jobs and value in the field the financial
engineering of the program is one of its strengths fibria
funds forestry production of its partners whose debts con
verted into wood are settled only at harvest periods

the environmental appeal is another highlight since all
producers should have their properties regularized according
to the rules of the forestry code and state laws the pro
gram also encourages the planting of up to 35 of native
seedlings for forest restoration
