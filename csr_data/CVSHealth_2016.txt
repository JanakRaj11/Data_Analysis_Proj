one of the greatest contributions cvs health can make toward improving health outcomes
for the millions of americans living with chronic health conditions is through educating people
on the benefits of medication adherence some of the nonadherence facts are alarming
it is estimated that up to a third of prescriptions written are never filled and about half of
all patients prescribed medications for chronic conditions stop taking them within the
first year the biggest dropoff occurring in the first month ultimately patients who take
their medications as prescribed have better health outcomes than those who do not
nonadherence of essential medications leads to thousands of preventable hospitalizations

focus operational ecoefficiency and compliance

we have assessed our operational footprint and determined that energy use and ghg
emissions are the most significant impacts for two reasons our real estate footprint is
continually growing and covered more than 99 million square feet of building space in 2015
with retail pharmacies accounting for much of this in addition we have a vast distribution
and transportation network that services our stores on a continual basis water use and landfill
waste are other impacts although to a much lesser degree our strategy for sustainable
operations focuses on these impacts with a priority on reducing ghg emissions because
of the link to climate change to do that we focus on energy efficiency
