prefabricated bathroom modules evolving with the times
in 1964 the hotel new otani japans first highrise hotel was completed just in time to welcome international visitors
for the opening of the tokyo olympic games in 1963 japans first prefabricated bathroom module based on jis
provisions was developed for installation in the new hotel
       since then the toto group has constantly worked to please customers by developing various functions based on
universal design concepts examples include quickdrying karari floorstm and highly insulated mahobin bathtubstm that
allow no more than a 25c decline in water temperature over a span of four hours
       more recently we have developed the hokkarari floor an evolution of the karari floortm that features a soft texture
customers can comfortably kneel on in addition we are moving forward with the incorporation of a platform structure
for prefabricated bathroom module floors to create greater development possibilities and enhance production and
installation efficiency

     risk management
     every year we identify the major risks that could have a significant impact on stakeholders and promote our risk preven
     tion measures each major risk is mapped out on a matrix evaluating degree of impact and frequency of occurrence from
     the viewpoints of damage to the brand and impact on personnel and financial consequences risks scoring high in risk
     points are flagged as priority risks and monitored by the risk management committee and risk mitigation activities are
     promoted throughout the entire group


     strengthening of compliance
     in order to prevent violations we believe that we must strengthen our management system and create an organization
     that respects compliance for this reason we developed two training courses throughout the business group namely
     interactive compliance training and compliance management training

in pursuit of greater quality and safety
to ensure product quality customers can enjoy with safety and confidence and to provide customers with products and
services they will be satisfied with the toto group has installed an iso 9001based comprehensive management
system and works with suppliers to continuously improve the quality assurance system with particular regard to
ensuring product safety and disclosing information to customers we have formulated the basic policy for voluntary
action plans on product safety

emphasizing aftersales service
toto quality refers not just to the quality of products themselves but also
product assembly and maintenance if a problem arises to enhance quality in
this sense we strive for example to improve maintenance skills educate
employees on proper behavior in interacting with customers and reduce the
time between receipt of a service request and completion of the necessary
repairs in addition we send customers who have received aftersales services
a postcard survey on a random basis to gather information on their satisfac                               aftersales service
tion with the services that have been provided

aftersales service convention held in china
to further improve service quality in china we hold an annual aftersales
service convention to which we invite representatives of 40 service compa
nies held in shanghai this event serves as an opportunity to announce the
management direction and service quality targets for the year
      it also gives us a chance to promote service awareness we do this by
sharing with attendees details on outstanding service efforts recognized at
the service masters contest held in japan and by presenting awards to                                     service companies recognized for superior
                                                                                                           performance at the annual aftersales service
