the sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the deﬁned beneﬁt
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the
assumptions may be correlated

the sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the deﬁned beneﬁt
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the
assumptions may be correlated
there is no change in the method of valuation for the prior period
