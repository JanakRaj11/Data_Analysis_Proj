tes                 or impairment
    ting goodwill ffor

goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with ias 36 impairment of assets no impairment losses have been recognised
based on these tests


for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment sampo determines the recoverable amount of its cashgenerating units to
which goodwill has been allocated on the basis of value in use sampo has defined these cashgenerating units as if group and
mandatum life


the recoverable amounts for if have been determined by using a discounted cash flow model the model is based on sampos
managements best estimates of both historical evidence and economic conditions such as volumesinterest rates margins
capital structure and income and cost development the value in use model for mandatum life is greatly influenced by the long
term development of insurance liabilities affecting eg the required solvency capital and thus the recoverable amount that is
why the forecast period is longer for mandatum life 10 years the derived cash flows were discounted at the pretax rates of the
weighted average cost of capital which for if was 78 and for mandatum life 84 these are somewhat lower than last year due
to the decrease in interest rates


forecasts for if approved by the management cover years 2015  2016 the cash flows beyond that have been extrapolated
using a 2 growth rate a 2 growth rate for years beyond 2024 has been used for the for mandatum life as well as it is believed
to be close to the anticipated inflation


in mandatum life the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by some eurm 780 with the calculation method used
eg an increase of about 47 in the weighted average cost of capital could lead to a situation where the recoverable amount of
the entity would equal its carrying amount


as for the if group the management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would not
cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount

in the table above are presented fair values and carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities the detailed measurement
bases of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in group accounting policies


the fair value of investment securities is assessed using quoted prices in active markets if published price quotations are not
available the fair value is assessed using discounting method values for the discount rates are taken from the markets yield
curve


the fair value of the derivative instruments is assessed using quoted market prices in active markets discounting method or
option pricing models


the fair value of loans and other financial instruments which have no quoted price in active markets is based on discounted cash
flows using quoted market rates the markets yield curve is adjusted by other components of the instrument eg by credit risk


the fair value for shortterm noninterestbearing receivables and payables is their carrying amount


disclosed fair values are clean fair values ie less interest accruals




                                                                    220

17 determination and hierarchy of fair values

a large majority of sampo groups financial assets are valued at fair value the valuation is based on either published price
quatations or valuation techniques based on market observable inputs where available for a limited amount of assets the value
needs to be determined using other techniques the financial instruments measured at fair value have been classified into three
hierarchy levels in the notes depending on eg if the market for the instrument is active or if the inputs used in the valuation
technique are observable

on level 1 the measurement of the instrument is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

on level 2 inputs for the measurement of the instrument include also other than quoted prices observable for the asset or
liability either directly or indirectly by using valuation techniques

on level 3 the measurement is based on other inputs rather than observable market data

since january 1 2008 the main swedish pension plan has been closed to new employees born in 1972 or later and the
corresponding norwegian pension plan has been closed to new employees since january 1 2006 regardless of age in may 2015
if decided that all employees born in 1958 or later that are covered by the norwegian definedbenefit pension plan would be
switched to a definedcontribution plan as of january 1 2016 as of the same date it was also decided that existing retirees
would no longer be covered by the plan and that future retirees would cease being covered by the plan when they are no longer
employed by if accordingly as of yearend 2015 the norwegian pension plan consists solely of active people employed prior to
2006 and born no later than 1957


the pension benefits referred to are oldage pension and survivors pension in sweden and oldage pension survivors pension
and disability pension in norway a common feature of all of the pension plans is that the employees and survivors encompassed
by the plans are entitled to a guaranteed pension that depends on the employees service period and pensionable salary at the
time of retirement the dominating benefit is the oldage pension which refers in part to temporary pension before the
anticipated retirement age and in part to a lifelong pension after the anticipated retirement age


the retirement age for receiving premature pension is normally 62 years in sweden and normally 65 years in norway in sweden
premature oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 65 percent of the
pensionable salary and applies to all employees born in 1955 or earlier and who were covered by the insurance sectors collective
bargaining agreement of 2006 in norway premature oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of
approximately 70 percent of the pensionable salary and applies to all employees born in 1957 or earlier and who were
employed by if in 2013


the anticipated retirement age in connection with lifelong pension is 65 years for sweden and 67 years for norway in sweden
lifelong oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 10 of the pensionable salary
between 0 and 75 income base amounts 65 of salary between 75 and 20 income base amounts and 325 between 20 and 30
income base amounts in norway lifelong oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of
approximately 70 of the pensionable salary up to 12 national insurance base amounts together with the estimated statutory
oldage pension paidup policies and pension payments from the swedish plans are normally indexed upwards in an amount
corresponding to the change in the consumer price index however there is no agreement guaranteeing the value and future
supplements in addition to the contractual pension benefit could either rise of fall pension payments from the norwegian plans
are were earlier indexed upwards in an amount corresponding to 80  100 of the change in the consumer price index instead as
of january 1 2016 a paidup policy is issued on retirement whereby if is no longer responsible for and has no obligation in
respect of future indexation of the insured plans


the pensions are primarily funded through insurance whereby the insurers establish the premiums and disburse the benefits ifs
obligation is primarily fulfilled through payment of the premiums should the assets that are attributable to the pension benefits
not be sufficient to enable the insurers to cover the guaranteed pension benefits if could be forced to pay supplementary
insurance premiums or secure the pension obligations in some other way in addition to insured pension plans there are also
unfunded pension benefits in norway for which if is responsible for ongoing payment


to cover the insured pension benefits the related capital is managed as part of the insurers management portfolios in such
management the characteristics of the investment assets are analyzed in relation to the characteristics of the obligations in a
process known as asset liability management new and existing asset categories are evaluated continuously in order to diversify
the asset portfolios with a view to optimizing the anticipated riskadjusted return any surplus that arises from management of
the assets normally accrues to if andor the insured and there is no form of transfer of the asset value to other members of the
insurance collective


the insurers and if are jointly responsible for monitoring the pension plans including investment decisions and contributions
the pension plans are essentially exposed to similar material risks regarding the final amount of the benefits the investment risk
associated with the plan assets and the fact that the choice of discount interest rate affects their valuation in the financial
statements


when applying ias 19 the pension obligations are calculated as is the pension cost attributable to the fiscal period using
actuarial methods pension rights are considered to have been vested straight line during the service period the calculation of
pension obligations is based on future anticipated pension payments and includes assumptions regarding mortality employee
turnover and salary growth the nominally calculated debt is discounted to the present value using an interest rate based on
current market interest rates adjusted to take into account the duration of the companys pension obligations as a basis for
determining the discount interest rate for the swedish obligation if uses liquid covered mortgage bonds issued by a mortgage
institution covered mortgage bonds are also used for the norwegian obligation after a deduction for the plan assets a net
asset or net liability is recognised in the balance sheet


the following tables contain a number of material assumptions specifications of pension costs assets and liabilities and a
sensitivity analysis showing the potential effect on the obligations of reasonable changes in those assumptions as at the end of
the fiscal year as apparent from the tables the said amendments to the insured plan in norway have been taken into account
when preparing the annual accounts for 2015 and had a material impact on both recognized costs and assets and obligations


the carrying amounts have been stated including special payroll tax in sweden 2426 and a corresponding fee in norway

the board of directors of sampo plc has decided on the longterm incentive schemes 2011 i  2014 i for the management and
key employees of sampo group the board has authorised the ceo to decide who will be included in the scheme as well as the
number of calculated incentive units granted for each individual used in determining the amount of the incentive reward in the
schemes the number of calculated incentive units granted for the members of the group executive committee is decided by the
board of directors some 130 persons were included in the schemes at the end of year 2015


the amount of the performancerelated bonus is based on the value performance of sampos a share and on the insurance
margin im and on sampos return on the risk adjusted capital rorac the value of one calculated incentive unit is the trade
weighted average price of sampos ashare at the time period specified in the terms of the scheme and reduced by the starting
price adjusted with the dividends per share distributed up to the payment date the predividend starting prices vary between
eur 1837  4338 the maximum value of one incentive unit varies between eur 3337  6238 reduced by the dividendadjusted
starting price in all the schemes the incentive reward depends on two benchmarks if the im is 6 per cent or more the imbased
reward is paid in full if the im is between 4  599 per cent half of the incentive reward is paid no imrelated reward will be paid
out if the im stays below these in addition the return on the risk adjusted capital is taken into account if the return is at least
risk free return  4 per cent the roracbased incentive reward is paid out in full if the return is risk free return  2 percent but
less than risk free return  4 percent the payout is 50 per cent if the return stays below these benchmarks no roracbased
reward will be paid out


each plan has three performance periods and incentive rewards are settled in cash in three installments the employee shall
authorise sampo plc to buy sampos ashares with 60 per cent of the amount of the reward after taxes and other comparable
charges the shares are subject to transfer restrictions for three years from the day of payout a premature payment of the
reward may occur in the event of changes in the group structure or in the case of employment termination on specifically
determined bases the fair value of the incentive schemes is estimated by using the blackscholes pricing model
