               though we fell short of our target production for the reporting
               period 201314 we maintained a strong growth momentum for
               the year for the fifth consecutive year we have entered the 100
               million club in terms of coal production mcl has the lowest
               manpower contingent among cils subsidiaries in the 100
               million club we are proud to have achieved the highest total

               growth against the previous year our total coal offtake was

               increased our growth in ob removal by 627 over the previous
               year however we were affected by the economic slowdown in
               the country resulting in a decline in gross revenue of 1316561
               crores as against 1319042 crores in the previous year

statement from the chairman cum managing director

  unearthing green

progressing on our journey towards sustainable mining we adopted new technologies and made
capital investments to develop our logistical infrastructure with the objective of mitigating climate
change and in our quest for dust and blast free mining we have increased the use of surface miners
in all our mines 7829 of our total coal production has been achieved through the use of surface
miners translating into 10008254 tonnes of co2 emission reduction annually to ease the logistical
hindrance of coal dispatch along with reduction of dust pollution and mitigation of carbon emission
we have undertaken big projects to increase transport of coal through railways and use new
technology in coal dispatch we have planned and approved a capital investment of 46968 crores in
the construction of the gopalpur tract  a 52 km long railway track from basundhara area ib valley
coalfield to jharsuguda railway station together with the se railways two mous were signed
between mcl and se railways for land acquisition and construction of the railway line with the
expectation of increasing the rake movement capacity of talcher coalfield we initiated the
construction of kalingaangul link railway line this apart 10 rapid loading systems silo will be
constructed across 10 different projects which will significantly increase the rate of coal dispatch

we took a strategic approach to reducing our carbon footprint by focussing on the use of technology
in mining and harnessing energy efficient resources the total energy saved over the last reporting
period was 6826078 gj of which the energy saved due to reduction in fuel consumption was
1581173 gj and the energy saved due to reduction in electricity consumption was 5244905 gj we
also achieved savings of 501 gj of energy with monetary savings of 774951 through installation of
led lamps in the mining areas and installation of capacitor banks in the substations we also applied
for the energy management system enms of iso 50001 in the subsequent reporting period of
201415 to help us in rationalizing our consumption of energy

aligning ourselves to the renewable energy policy of both the government of india and coal india
ltd we initiated the commissioning of a 2mw photo voltaic solar power plant at mcl hq anand
vihar sambalpur this is the first mega watt scale solar project among all subsidiaries of coal india
limited



  unearthing smiles

we believe it is our duty to build relationships and spread smiles amongst the communities
surrounding our operations as a socially responsible company mcl invests its resources towards
the socioeconomic upliftment of the society as per its csr policy for the reporting period mcl
spent 11148 crores which is almost 308 of its pat 362430 crores in csr activities focussing
on key areas of education drinking water supply sports infrastructure development amongst other
activities some of the major csr initiatives undertaken were widening the road from two lanes to
four lanes from bankibahal in bg area to kanika railways siding through district authority widening
and strengthening of balinga taparia road in three phases providing power supply of 11 kva415
volts to 5 villages in sundergarh etc in addition to the medical facilities provided through our existing

                                                                        csr and sustainability report 201314 pg 06

statement from the chairman cum managing director
we are also committed to strengthen the sports culture in odisha through sports infrastructure
development and have enabled the construction of the stadium in jharsuguda through the district
authority we continued our efforts to enable land oustees to have a better standard of living and
provided employment to 773 project affected people paps during fy 201314 as per the rr
policy we have also introduced new schemes to encourage paps to form cooperative societies and
develop them as our ancillary vendors

we are emphasising on a safe and enriching environment for our workforce for this we organised
various training and safety programmes all the six underground mines of mcl are fatal free during
fy 201314 zero fatality in underground mines is achieved in succession since last six years no
fatal and serious injuries have occurred in 12 ocps of mcl out of its 16 ocps during fy 201314
this is due to our sustained efforts towards achieving zero accident rates this includes adopting
multi pronged strategies like preparation and implementation of safety management plan in each of
the mine critical and in depth analysis of each and every accident regular safety audit regular
organization of safety drives like monthly safety day annual mines safety fortnight involvement of
workers representatives in various safety forums like pit safety committee meetings annual bipartite
 tripartite meeting and yet despite all our efforts and strong resolve to achieve a zeroaccident
mcl we were saddened with the loss of a precious human life during the reporting period we have
therefore renewed our efforts to provide a zero accident environment through training rd and
monitoring of our operational practices we introduced few technological interventions to enhance
the safety and work standards like use of ripper dozer for ob removal and surface miners for coal
extraction and use of sdls and lhds in ug mines we also plan to install man riding systems in all
the underground mines to help reduce the strenuous walking and transit time of our workers

this journey towards unearthing growth and smiles will be long and arduous and we need the
support of our stakeholders to reach our goals i therefore request you to read this report and give
your valuable feedback which will help us improve the quality of reporting and further our
sustainability journey to unearthing progress for our country

              training is an important part of creating a strong culture at mcl
              we are determined to be known for our high ethical standards
              and our commitment to transparency and openness we have
              zero tolerance for corruption in our operations at mcl how we
              deliver is as important as what we deliver our commitment to
              ethics and transparency is integral to how we conduct our
              business and vital to ensuring that the wealth derived from the
              energy we produce is put to effective and equitable use our
              value statement together with the ethics and code of conduct
              constitutes the basis and framework for our performance
              culture

              protecting and respecting human rights is central to our
              everyday business operations we respect the human rights of
              all our stakeholders and hence consider human rights across
              all aspects of our operations which would eventually reflect in
              the sustainability of our organization we are committed to
              achieve the highest standards of business integrity ethical
              values and professionalism in all our activities we adhere to the
              mines act 1952 for preventing child labour as per this act
              employment of children below 18 years of age in a mine is
              prohibited we follow proper checks and audits as per the act to
              ensure no child is employed in the mines including medical
              examinations for age proof a clause has also been introduced
              in all our contracts as per child labour prohibition and
              regulation act 1986 to prevent child labour in contractual
              assignments we continually sensitize our employees about
              their rights by conducting workshops and seminars covering
              these topics however we do not have any formal training for our
              employees or security personnel on human rights we also
              discourage forced and compulsory labour in all our operations
              as well as discourage our suppliers and contractors to adopt
              forced or compulsory labour

unearthing transparency
although we do not have an exclusive human rights policy we respect ilo and other international
charters on social and labour issues inline with our corporate governance policy currently our
parent company coal india ltd is evaluating a comprehensive and robust human rights policy
which will also be followed by us when implemented as a public sector undertaking psu mcl falls
under the right to information act rti and our activities including our supplier contracts are open to
audit by cag cvc cbi etc all major contracts are awarded through the etender system

we abide by the labour law act to uphold the dignity of our workers few of our operations are
adjacent to indigenous people communities however there has been no incident or violation related
to human rights of the indigenous people during the reporting period

                     past                      current                  way forward
                we are an ardent          successful in digitizing   we will pursue our efforts
             supporter of ethics and      many of our processes      in recognising loopholes
             good business conduct      for systemic improvement         in the system and
               since inception we      and inducing the concept     developing apt solutions
               attempted to evoke              of ethics and              to resolve them

                 business deals            regular awareness
                                                  drives


attempts to combat corruption and ensure ethical practices become possible through effective
vigilance during the period 31 inspections including routine and surprise inspections have been
made by the vigilance team in various establishmentsprojects of mcl including diesel consumption
coal quality security deployment coal transportation local purchase emergency purchase and
public procurements necessary disciplinary actions were initiated proposed against 29 officials of
mcl

our major thrust during reporting period of 201314 has been to inculcate technology in our vigilance
administration our successful attempts at ensuring transparency in our endeavours included
   installation of rfid assisted inmotion road weighbridges to keep track of internal colliery
    transport
   autorefund of earnest money deposit emd to unsuccessful bidders by emode
   online bill payment status on coal net
   implementation of fully operational gps based oitds operator independent truck despatch
    system for ob removal
   installation of geofencing to keep track of vehicles transporting coal
   installation of gps based vehicle tracking system in contractual water tankers engaged for
    supply of drinking water to peripheral villages as part of csr programme
                                                                       csr and sustainability report 201314 pg 26

unearthing transparency
we also attempted systemic improvements in our existing practices to prevent corruption and further
assist the company to achieve our goals and objectives in an ethical manner few initiatives
encompassing technology interventions onsite and towards streamlining official transactions were
     introduction of timely completion of procurement process within the original bid validity period
     amendment in dop delegation of power of the project officers for timely closure of petty
     contracts
     introduction of uniform selection criteria for recruitment of clerical grade employees
     appropriate measures taken for procurement of 3d laser systemsurpac total station for
     coal stock measurement
     amendment in eprocurement module of mcl for online withdrawal of bids at any point of time
     implementation of pis personal information system module

most of these initiatives have resulted in expediting official transactions and proved to be effective for
grievance redressal of our stakeholders the gps based vehicle tracking system have also
fetched us monetary savings of 7869 lakhs in contractual payments within one year of
implementation

we continuously spread the concept of anticorruption and encourage ethical practices throughout

    statutory supervisory personnel

these committees monitor the safety events and also provide advice on occupational health and
safety the abovementioned bipartite and tripartite committees are actively involved in assisting
the management to take certain decisions and resolve problems they also conduct health and
safety programmes involving all employees including union representatives health and safety
aspects are also covered in formal agreement with unions based on national coal wage agreement

  occupational
  health

extensive risk management to identify and assess the potential risks and shape a healthy working
environment is the key element of our activities in the area of occupational health and safety for us
sustainability implies ensuring employees follow sustainable practices in their personal lives too this
means taking care of their health practicing safety and maintaining a healthy worklife balance at
mcl we have introduced several initiatives that help employees achieve this balance


medical checkups
regular medical checkups are conducted for all our employees
 initial medical examination ime this is conducted for every person seeking employment in a
  mine unless such a person has already undergone this examination within the preceding five
  years while in employment at another mine

periodic medical examination pme this is also conducted for every person employed in the

  mine at intervals of not more than five years the frequency of pme has been brought down from
  existing 5 years to 3 years for the mining employees above 45 years of age as decided in the 10th
  safety conference


preventive health programmes
the health centres at talcher ib valley and hq conduct several health camps programmes as a
precautionary measure these camps definitely help in alleviating severe health conditions they
also act as an indirect route for creating awareness about the dreadful diseases such as cancer and
aids during 201314 a total of 260 such medical camps were conducted and about 23240
beneficiaries participated in these camps the various camps conducted include general health
awareness camps 50 diagnostic camps 14 cancer detection camp 1 aids awareness camps

energy saving initiatives
during the reporting period 201314 we attempted to reduce consumption of both our direct and
indirect energy our focus was to evaluate our existing systems and improve them leading to overall
reduction of energy consumption

reduction in fuel and lubricant consumption
we attempted to reduce our annual fuel and lubricant consumption by streamlining our regular
maintenance procedures such as periodic overhauling of engines regular checking of filters hoses
 tyre pressure regular checking of selfstarters introduction of maintenance free batteries and
regular maintenance of haul roads we also abided by the norms fixed by cmpdi for specific diesel
consumption and implemented guidelines issued by ied for minimum hsd consumption

reduction in electricity consumption
few electricity saving initiatives were implemented in the reporting period through installation of led
lamps in the mining areas and installation of capacitor banks in the substations to improve power
factors which led to energy savings to the amount of 50155 gj and monetary savings of 774951

corporate accounting and reporting standard we are reporting on the co2 emissions basis our
direct energy consumption and indirect energy consumption which translate to scope 1 and scope
2 emissions respectively as per the ghg protocol the scope 1 emissions were calculated from fuel
consumed by hemms  departmental vehicles used at hq office and diesel or residual fuel oil
used in generators and scope 2 emissions were calculated from grid electricity supply scope 3

our approach towards reducing carbon footprint involves
    creating a more energy efficient mcl please refer to above energy saving initiatives for details
    mitigating the impact of blasting and drilling through use of surface miner technology
     eliminating carbon footprint at source
    mitigating the overall impact of emissions of our operations through afforestation


surface miner technology
conventional coal mining technology involves tedious blasting drilling and crushing operations
which lead to ghg emissions hence we have adopted a more modern and sustainable mining
technology surface miners sms which are an ecofriendly replacement for the abovementioned
operations involved in coal production in open cast mines the sms reduce the overall carbon
footprint of the process by eliminating these operational stages during production of coal this
technology also enables selective mining of coal and stone layers which reduces the ash content in
the coal produced as a result the volume of coal transported is reduced and there is reduction of co2
emission due to transportation during the reporting period 7829 of coal production 8646 mt
has been through surface miner technology translating to reduction of co2 emission by 10008254
tonnes


green belt development
we have successfully implemented plantation drives across all our operations and have planted 479
lakhs saplings since inception plantations have been done on ob dumps along the roads in the
residential townships and even in our office premises total reduction in co2 emission due to
plantation activities on an average has been estimated to be 20 kgtreeyear which translates to total
co2 emission reduction of 95800 tonnesyear

the amount of dust formation and emission is dependent on several sitespecific variables like the
type and size of equipment in use topography vegetation cover characteristics of the rock or soil
material wind speed in the region the size of the machinery or transport equipment speed of the
vehicle frequency of vehicle movement etc

the quality of air in and around the mines is monitored every fortnight as per environment
protection amendment rule the total estimation of tpm at our operations for the year 201314 is
782331 tonnes at talcher coalfield and 850364 tonnes at ib valley coalfield during the reporting
period monitoring analysis and source apportionment study receptor modelling using cmb 82 of
particulate matter pm10 was conducted around bhubaneswari ocp of talcher coalfield the study
confirmed that the average pm10 mass concentration ranged from 140 184 gm3 other air pollutants
like so2 nox co2 etc are recorded far below the statutory norms in mcl

however we continuously focus on mitigation measures for reducing air emissions as listed below
 use of surface miners to eliminate dust generated due to drilling and blasting operations
 use of railways for 8590 of coal transportation to prevent dust generation associated with truck
  transport
 establishment of silo loading system for coal despatch to reduce dust emission at loading sites
 installation of covered belt conveyors at bharatpur chp and jagannath chp to prevent dust
  emission during transportation
 covering of all road sale trucks leaving the mine premises in all areas
 construction of black top metal topconcrete coal transport roads and haul roads with provision for
  dozer wheeled dozer and graders for maintenance of roads and control of dust pollution
 installation of water sprinkling facilities
      water sprinklers at 18 sidings
      water sprinklers at all chps
      mobile water tankers of capacity 28 kl20 kl 12 kl and 10 kl operating on coalob
       transportation roads
 installation of dust extractors in all drilling machines and practice of wet drilling encouraged in all
  mines
 regular sweeping of roads accomplished by
      use of truck mountedmechanical road sweepers at talcher coalfield
      manual sweeping in all mines
 ban on coal supply as domestic fuel and all employees provided with lpg

apart from the above mentioned mitigation measures adopted we are also constructing exclusive
coal transport corridors at several sites to eliminate the impact of dust pollution on the nearby
communities

  noise pollution
  and ground vibration

controlling noise pollution and ground vibration generated during mining is a key challenge and
concern to mcl mining activities such as drilling and blasting operation and maintenance of
hemms loading and unloading transportation crushing at chp and loading at sidings are the major
sources of high noise levels hence we are keen on adopting adequate measures to cope with high
noise levels

we are one of the pioneers in india in introduction of blastless modern mining technology such as
surface miner technology and ripper dozers controlled blasting system and use of nonelectric
detonators have also been effective in curbing the noise pollution and ground vibration further we
also ensure that all hemms are provided with adequate noise level reduction technologies as
already mentioned in the safety section we provide all our workers working at high noiselevel areas
with ear muffs and ear plugs more initiatives like green belt development between residential areas
and the mines have also helped in reducing the impact of noise on the surrounding areas few more
initiatives for curbing noise are
      provision of sound proof enclosures of chp and crusher where operator seat is located
      proper maintenance of equipment by oiling and greasing

during the reporting period 2618228 million litres of fresh water were withdrawn from surface water
sources for our mining operations the amount of underground mine water recycled at our facilities is
6419867 million litres 7103  of total mine water used by employing these practices we try to
maintain a balance between what is needed for our business and what is good for the environment

the major sources of water include river water and pumped out mine water there has been only a
marginal reduction in the consumption of water for domestic and industrial purposes as seen from
previous years water recycled after being pumped from underground sources is used for mining
operations such as dust suppression or fire fighting and also supplied as drinking water to

water conservation initiatives
we try to conserve water by transforming the mine voids as natural water harvesting structures and
by recycling the underground mine water

mine voids as natural water harvesting  sedimentation ponds decoaled mine voids are

  structures created on a continual basis after excavation since we have a low stripping ratio
  about 40 to 50 of the quarry used for mining purpose results in mine voids we at mcl make
  complete utilization of these voids for water conservation and preventing water pollution

     water storage these voids act as a collection point for strata seepage water rain water is
        also collected in these huge voids during rainy season water from ob dumps coal stock
        yards and other catchment areas are also channelized through garland drains and catch
        drains to these natural mine voids

     groundwater recharge the underground water table gets recharged due to accumulation
        of rain water in these huge voids and control of surface run off

     pollution control these mine voids act as sedimentation ponds for settling the tss which
        is usually the only impurity in the collected water

recycling of underground mine water water pumped out from underground mines is recycled

  for domestic supply after adequate treatment small scale water filtration units for the recycled
  underground mine water are operational at talcher and orient areas for domestic supply

green water management rainwater harvesting
rainwater harvesting is a technique of collection and storage of rain water in surface storage
tanks or sub surface aquifer before it is lost as surface runoff the tapped rainwater can be
effectively utilized for recirculation and usage or for recharging the ground water

we have initiated three rainwater harvesting projects one each at orient area ib valley
area and cwsx talcher area in our projects at ib valley and orient area rainwater is
collected on the roof tops which is then directed to gravity head recharge wells through pvc
pipes the water from these recharge wells eventually percolates to the subsurface aquifers
through natural infiltration at cwsx talcher area the rainwater is collected from roof tops
and other catchment areas and channelized to drains through the drains the water flows to
open wells via pvc pipes 8 diameter the collected water eventually seeps to the
subsurface aquifers from these wells

on successful implementation of these projects we plan to multiply the effort to all our areas
for effective green water management

  biodiversity


mcl recognises that protecting the environment and maintaining the biological diversity of our planet
is of vital importance to human life coal mining being site specific expansion to new regions with
deposits of coal seams is a regular activity expansion of our activities poses a great challenge to the
biodiversity and hence we effectively engage with all the stakeholders to arrive at solutions which
have longlasting benefits to the surrounding biodiversity and as well as the communities

after removal of ob once the area is decoaled the mine voids created are backfilled due to low
stripping ratio even after backfilling terminal voids remain in the mines which serve as huge water
reservoirs these water reservoirs attract the birds and the fauna besides maintaining the water
table concurrent biological reclamation by grassing and massive plantation is undertaken by
levelling the backfilled area within few years of plantation the area develops into a forest thereby
creating a safe home for wild species hence the forest area that was already interfered prior to
mining either due to illegal settlements or illicit tree felling poaching etc which would have disturbed
the natural habitat is restored to its previous natural state besides other premining nonforest land
like homestead agricultural wasteland etc are also converted to forests and water bodies after the
completion of mining activity in the area

implementation of conservation plan for protection of flora and fauna are carried out as per ecfc
taxonomical enumeration of flora and fauna in the core and buffer zone is made through a recognised
institute remote sensing satellite data are generated by cmpdil on annual basis for more than 5
mm3 mines and once in three years for less than 5 mm mines of composite production to help in

forests are diverted for mining purposes as per the provisions in the forest conservation act 1980
during the year 201314 we acquired 59877 hectares including forest nonforest and tenancy

we do not have a specific biodiversity policy but the environment policy of cil that we have adopted
specifically stresses on conservation of biodiversity we put in sincere efforts to restrict actual mining
to an optimal area which gradually advances and as the decoaledmined areas become available
the backfilling and reclamation activities commence we acquire land for expansion of mining

biodiversity protection strategy
mcl has identified two strategic aims to protect the biodiversity
   land reclamation to identify methods and create an appropriate framework for reclamation of
    the excavated land
   plantation to identify opportunities for the creation of new biodiversity that has been lost from
    the mine locality during recent years


land reclamation
during the reporting period decoaled voids were backfilled with the overburden material followed by
plantation for biological reclamation regular monitoring of land use pattern by remote sensing was
conducted for 15 opencast projects ie 11 ocps production capacity 5 mm3yr and 4 ocps
production capacity 5 mm3yr the monitoring studies were executed through cmpdil in both
talcher coalfield and ib valley coalfield the 11 ocps of production capacity 5 mm3yr included 7
projects in talcher coalfield ananta balaram lingaraj bharatpur bhubaneswari jagannath and
hingula and 4 projects in ib valley coalfield belpahar lakhanpur samaleswari and lajkura
during the reporting period the total excavated area in these 11 ocps was 4443 km2 and the total
area reclaimed was 2884 km2 bharatpur ocp topped the list for land reclamation with 7899
followed by balaram ocp with 7556 the report on land restoration reclamation of these ocps
was prepared by cmpdil using data generated by national remote sensing agency the report has
also been uploaded on the company website


plantation
plantation has been implemented on external dumps backfilled internal dumps after adequate
physical reclamation and any other available vacant space including road sides office premises as
well as residential colonies as previously mentioned in subsectiongreen belt development we
have planted approximately 4790 lakhs saplings since inception talcher coalfield 1861 lakhs ib
valley coalfield  2852 lakhs  hq  077 lakhs fruitbearing timber yielding flowering dust
capturing and medicinal species of indigenous origin were selected for plantation in all areas the

overburden management
overburden ob is one of the major wastes that is generated during the surface mining of coal in
open cast mines the overburden removed is effectively managed at mcl by backfilling the same
into the decoaled voids and thereafter following a systematic technical and biological reclamation
process similar process is also followed for the external overburden dumps we have embarked on
a systematic scientific study to determine the stability of the high walls of coal overburden benches
and the overburden dumps for all our open cast mines

during the reporting period of 201314 9603 mm3 of overburden was removed as compared to
9042 mm3 removed in the previous year

coal transportation and logistics
coal transportation  logistics is a very important function of coal mining business movement of
coal from production points to consuming end via different modes of transportation mostly depends
on the established transportation and logistics systems at the mining area and also at the consumers
technological interventions in transport logistics has been our thrust area for developing a robust
coal market and ensuring energy security of the country coal dispatch through railways is the
preferred option and we are focussing on investing in developing both rail transport systems as well
as railways siding for safe and easy transport of coal two such projects are currently underway

    gopalpur tract construction of a 52 km long railway track from basundhara area ib valley
    
    coalfield to jharsuguda railway station will not only benefit hasslefree transportation of coal
    but also indirectly benefit the jharsuguda district as this will establish a longneeded
    passenger transport railway track for the community
    kalingaangul link the construction of kalingaangul link railway line near the talcher
    
    coalfield is expected to increase the rake movement

this apart rapid loading system silo would be constructed in 10 different projects which would
significantly increase the rate of coal dispatch the areas where the rapid loading systems would be
installed include ananta 15 mt lingaraj 16 mt bharatpur 15 mt bhubaneswari 20 mt
hingula 15 mt kaniha 10 mt balaram 8 mt kulda 10 mt mjsjgopal prasad 15 mt and

unearthing quality
coal beneficiation
the indian coal matrix consists of significant ash content interwoven throughout the matrix hence
coal beneficiation to remove the ash and impurities from the coal is essential to produce good quality
coal coal washeries are units that wash off the ash soil and other impurities from coal the washed
coal is a value addition of coal which reduces the ash percentage and logistic bottleneck as the same
wagon would carry improved quality coal thereby reducing ash generation at power plants in this way
moefs stipulation for use and transport of coal with less than 34 ash is complied the washed coal
also fetches better price in the market we have initiated the planning for establishing 4 washeries at
talcher coalfield two ib valley coalfield one and basundhara one the feasibility of these
projects has been evaluated and the washeries are likely to function on a bom built operate
maintain model once the washeries are operational mcl would be able to produce coal with low
ash content to the power sector industries which will enable them to meet the moef norm of using
low ash noncoking coal




  customer
  satisfaction




we have taken utmost care to improve the quality of coal being supplied to different power houses
and to meet the satisfaction level of our customers during the reporting period various measures for
ensuring proper quality of coal dispatched were intensified and we achieved a record despatch of
11434 mt against 11196 mt as compared to the previous year however the quality complaints
increased to 53 as compared to 17 in the previous year we are working on improving product quality
and customer satisfaction

we deal with our consumers buyers following the directives of ministry of coal cil we sell coal to all
our customers through fuel supply agreement fsa eauction during the reporting period we
have signed 24 fsas with various customers the fsa has guidelines for ensuring customer
satisfaction it has an incentive and compensation clause which is an effective management
intervention to retain satisfaction level of our consumers also by mode of frequent interactions with
different customers we try to improve customer satisfaction a customer feedback form is also
available on our website which can be downloaded by the customers and submitted to us for
improvement
                                                                       csr and sustainability report 201314 pg 66

our service quality  our pride
we believe in delivering the best quality coal to our customers to meet this
vision of ours we identified the areas of improvement in enhancing the coal
quality and coal dispatch our attempt has been to improve our technology as
well as our processes to enhance the quality of our product and meet the
expectation of our customers supply of coal of uniform grade and invoking
transparency during coal dispatch were our key approaches to achieve
customer satisfaction and enhance service quality we also observed
quality week to develop awareness on quality at the grass root level


our approach
uniform coal grade
our objective was to produce coal of uniform size 100 mm by deployment of
surface miners we enforced a stricter quality control process by stringent
sampling procedures from seam stock siding  tipper samples an
               rd
independent 3 party agency was also deployed for sampling at all loading
points to ensure coal quality before dispatch coal samples were also
analysed in the coal analysis laboratories using sophisticated
instrumentation including electronic auto bomb calorimeter for
determination of gross calorific value of coal ten such coal analysis
laboratories were established in different areas including ib valley
lakhanpur orient basundhara garjanbahal jagannath lingaraj
bharatpur hingula talcher and kaniha during the reporting period 201314
the annual coal grade was declared of utmost satisfaction



transparency in coal dispatch
we developed procedures to encourage involvement of consumers during
coal dispatch by introducing registers at the coal loading pointssidings for
recording the commentssuggestions of the consumer representatives all
our sidings are equipped with electronic weighbridges with print out facility for
ensuring 100 weighment of coal dispatched apart from this we also
interacted frequently with the consumers to get their perspective to improve
our methods and meet their expectations all our dispatches at the railway
sidings were under the direct supervision of the nodal officers of the qc we
took suggestions from the consumers to develop a feedback format to record
complaints our qc department attended to these complaints and the
findings were communicated to the consumers by the spot officers of
department

our success
our combined efforts have resulted in offtake of 11434 mt during 201314
this accounted for an absolute growth of 2383 mt over last year despatch

electronic media and regularly update the media representatives on our performance

during the reporting period a new and vibrant mcl company logo was launched inline with our
vision of becoming the green champion we also launched a special coffee table book titled
behind the black another first in coal india depicting the journey of coal from ancient mining to
modern days and modern mcl amongst the various other firsts of mcl as a modern and new
technology adopting company we are also making use of social media through facebook and other
social media engines

brand visibility and promotion was maintained by the company through time to time release of press
notes from the company and regular interaction with media representatives for coverage of our
activities pamphlets and advertisements of our csr and environment initiatives showcasing our
achievements by participation in exhibitions in cuttack bhubaneswar and bangalore and a short
film on quality

community capacity building
we at mcl understand that local populace around our operations depend
on the mining economically as it is the major source of income for them
since mining has a finite life span we believe that we need to create
competence in other forms of livelihood over a period of time we have
therefore initiated several community initiatives targeted towards
sustainable livelihood we have innovatively created selfemployment
opportunities for locally residing skilled and unskilled unemployed paps
by providing a sustainable business to them

mcls new initiatives started since 201011 such as scheme of coal
transportation enables the paps who were not absorbed as employees
in mcl to form cooperative society and apply as vendors for loading and
transportation contracts with mcl as per this scheme each society is
registered in mcl for a period of five years to undertake work of value of
10 crores unlike other civilian contractors these cooperative societies
are waived off security deposit and also no penalty is imposed for any
shortfall in their work the work is mostly confined to providing
transportation facilities such as vehicles tippers and drivers mcl
verifies the required eligibility criteria for providing services such as
safety features of vehicles license verification of drivers a premedical
examination is also conducted for drivers to ensure their physical fitness
following this the vendors are selected for the work and the drivers are
provided the required training subsequently routine monitoring of the
vehicles are done by the safety officers

total no of beneficiaries is 739 out of 58 registered cooperative societies
as on 28042015 on an average 330 tippers per day operate for coal
transportation works entrusted to different cooperative societies for the
period 201314 the coal loading and transportation works through these
societies accounted for 1181 of the total coal transportation work of mcl
during 201314 during the said period 4210 mt of coal loading
transportation of value 14854 crores was accomplished which was
almost double than the previous year one such society sairam society
talcher coalfield expressed their satisfaction on this scheme during the
stakeholder engagement interaction they find the scheme not just as an
option for alternative occupation but very challenging and motivating
