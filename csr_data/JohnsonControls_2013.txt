 dear stakeholders
 we are pleased to provide our 2012 global reporting initiative gri report our report focuses on our accomplishments over the past year as a
 result of our commitment to our vision of creating a more comfortable safe and sustainable world

 johnson controls achieved a record 42 billion in revenues and 18 billion of adjusted earnings in fiscal 2012 our history of posting earnings
 growth now extends to 21 of the past 22 years we continued to pay a dividend to our shareholders as we have done every year since 1887
 further we increased the annual dividend once again this year

 having achieved these results despite a weak global economy we are proud of our financial performance while we were optimistic about growth
 across all our businesses coming into 2012 the macroeconomic environment was more difficult than we forecast

 we entered 2012 with record backlogs in our automotive experience business the north american auto market was positive but its strong
 demand was offset by continued weakness in the european auto market our metals and mechanisms segments in automotive experience were
 hampered by the sluggish european economy as well as performance issues that we are addressing

 our power solutions business benefitted from solid demand for batteries in europe in north america however mild winter weather slowed
 demand for aftermarket automobile batteries the soft global markets also impacted our building efficiency business we had record backlogs
 coming into the year but momentum slowed as the year progressed in the united states education health care and public sector institutional
 markets all declined 15 percent in 2012 despite the slow revenue growth profitability improved in the second half of the year as the business
 responded to market conditions and implemented cost reductions and pricing initiatives

 customer satisfaction is a significant part of our brand and the value we bring to our customers in 2012 we rededicated ourselves to our mission
 of exceeding our customers increasing expectations our company is rooted in this mission and renewing our focus and energy toward its
 fulfillment is vital to our continued success every day our 170000 employees around the world deliver the best products services and solutions

  longterm strategies
  johnson controls longterm strategies remain intact and are driven by our customers requirements and growth strategies we will continue to
  pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets focusing on energy efficiency for buildings and vehicles automotive experience will continue
  its focus on margin expansion through operational improvements in our seating metals segment and standardization of our core product portfolio

  our power solutions business growth strategy will build on our agm technology to support customer demand for startstop vehicles our strong
  market leadership position spans the entire spectrum of battery technology from leadacid batteries to advanced lithiumion batteries for hybrid
  and electric vehicles

  building efficiency will gain market share through our ability to help customers improve energy efficiency lower operating costs and reduce their
  greenhouse gas footprint with an emphasis on growth in emerging markets and the development of new technology

  outlook for 2013 and beyond
  the macro environment for 2013 indicates challenges ahead a mixed global market particularly a sluggish european economy will affect all of
  our businesses while we recognize growth in china is slowing we remain confident china will provide us with longterm opportunities we
  expect mixed global auto production to affect automotive experience with the largest decline in europe power solutions will likely see
  moderate improvements in the north america battery aftermarket building efficiency has a record backlog extending through 2013 yet demand
  is expected to soften in the first half of the year anticipating these challenges in late 2012 we announced restructuring activities across our
  businesses to reduce costs and align to market conditions these initiatives will deliver financial benefits in the second half of 2013 based on the
  strategies that we are implementing we expect our 2013 earnings to equal or slightly exceed our 2012 results

  as we look to the future we are confident in our ability to deliver longterm shareholder value we are committed to our mission of exceeding
  our customers increasing expectations and delivering new value each and every day through a combination of innovation and industryleading
  products and services

 substantial opportunity for improved energy efficiency and ghg emissions abatement johnson controls is the global leader in energyefficient
 retrofits green building technologies and integration of renewable energy sources into buildings
 performance contracting success in public and private sector  building efficiency has implemented or is working on more than 2500
 performance contracting projects with guaranteed savings of 75 billion these projects have resulted in the reduction of more than 16 million
 metric tons of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions since 2000roughly the same level of emissions generated from the energy use of
 13 million us homes in one year
 making building efficiency easier more accessible to a broader market  our global workplace solutions business is a leading provider of
 facility commercial real estate and energy management for many of the worlds largest companies customers in more than 75 countries have
 experienced more than 3 billion in savings over the past 10 years

 financial support  since the 1980s johnson controls has partnered with and helped organizations in the united states arrange financing
 solutions called performance contracts these performance contracts guarantee energy savings to cover the capital and operational costs of a
 project
 automotive technology and innovation are increasingly important in differentiating our products from competitors and driving profitable
 growth for our business we have increased the breadth of our technology competencies through acquisitions and the expansion of our global
 technology and advanced development group which has developed a number of innovative products and concepts
 automotive experience continues to introduce modular front seat structures believed to be the lowestweight structure of its kind on the market
 lightweight seats help improve vehicle fuel consumption and reduce co2 emissions our automotive experience team also has created an open
 innovation website to allow outside inventors to more easily share their technology ideas with us we believe that by partnering with external
 technology providers we can accelerate product development and innovation
 battery technology and innovation we continued to deploy our patented powerframe grid technology across our leadacid
 battery plants globally the optimized grid design and sturdy outer frame deliver significantly improved performance and reliability and extend
 the batterys life cycle the powerframe manufacturing process utilizes 20 percent less energy emits 20 percent fewer greenhouse gases and is
 virtually wastefree because all excess stamping materials are recycled
 startstop vehicle batteries  johnson controls is the worlds leading supplier of batteries for startstop vehicles startstop is a technology
 applied to a standard gasoline powered vehicle that automatically shuts the engine off during idle and restarts when the driver engages the clutch
 or releases the brake pedal reducing fuel use and emissions by 5 percent to 12 percent
 our approach to prioritizing challenges and opportunities
 our overall approach is to anticipate consumer needs and then integrate technologies products and services to make their lives better and easier
 we feel strongly that being seen as a global industry leader in sustainability is paramount for driving innovation and gaining strategic advantage
 from our humble beginning over a century ago we have understood that it takes more to ensure continued growth than simply watching quarterly
 profits although the term sustainability is relatively new we have always felt that good environmental stewardship and social responsibility all
 are integrated with economic prosperity for example designing our products and services to be more sustainable
  decreases risks associated with negative environmental and social impact etc
  improves the economic bottom line by reducing operating costs and optimizing lifecycle economic performance increasing building valuation
 improving employee performance etc and
  helps meet stakeholder expectations which helps retain employees and customers and provides a competitive marketing advantage
 our vision and values statement promotes sustainability as a companywide objective to ensure each business unit integrates it into its strategy
 and drives all aspects of sustainability into every corner of the enterprise our overarching sustainability policy resides within our vision and
 values and our ten year marker which provides guidance on company operations our vision and values are supported by our ethics policy
 human rights policy and climate change policy our policies provide a basis for ensuring regulatory compliance as well as commonly accepted
 social and environmental principles and practices expected by stakeholders of any global company desiring a sustainable future this means that
 no matter what innovation cost saving measure or whatever idea is considered no matter how potentially profitable it first and foremost must be
 achievable and still be compliant with our core values and compliant with host country regulations and applicable global standards eg is
 consistent with applicable ilo conventions universal declaration of human rights and ten principles of the united nations global compact
 in addition we continue to openly participate in organizations that add value to our business or help support our approach towards sustainability
 for example in addition to joining the carbon disclosure project cdp corporate supply chain programme we also joined the business
 roundtables see social environmental and economic change initiative that allows us to share best practices will many other leaders in the
 sustainability area in addition we joined the pew centers business environmental leadership council belc to help companies
 policymakers and investors understand how to successfully manage risks and capture new business opportunities as changes in public policy and
 customer preferences dramatically transform markets worldwide

 key conclusions about progress
 our overall progress to date has been consistent with our desire to be a leader in sustainability as demonstrated by our green products and services
 and listing on many more social investment indices however maintaining that position will be a challenge especially in the area of reducing
 greenhouse gases and finding new and innovative ways to reduce our carbon footprint and those of our customers our management team has put
 much emphasis on establishing sustainability leaders within each business unit to help the business stay on track to meet our aggressive
 sustainability goals we feel with the renewed emphasis placed on sustainability there will be more availability of resources to track and improve
 our environmental impact of our facilities and communities in which we operate

 main processes in place to address performance
 ethics and human rights  internal policies are in place to provide guidance regarding human rights governance environmental
 stewardship and nearly all other aspects of our company that we are likely to encounter we annually review many of these policies to ensure
 relevance as the company grows and confronts new business issues in the geographies where we operate an anonymous ethics hotline is
 available to anyone both inside and outside the company who suspects unethical behavior the hotline is available 24 hours a day in all major
 languages and is operated by an independent thirdparty vendor through the ethics hotline monitoring system we capture all information to help
 us investigate audit and implement improvement actions
 environmental  we focus on our own environmental performance with the same discipline that we apply to working with our customers
 we continue to review our operations and supply chain to identify continuous improvement opportunities to make products in more earthfriendly
 ways recently our senior management created two counsels to investigate and make recommendations to improve the companys overall focus

 on sustainability
 global purchasing council gpc  focuses on promoting sustainability within the supply chain we work with more than 300000
 direct and indirect suppliers throughout the world and expect them to conduct their operations in a socially and environmentally sustainable
 manner over the last year the gpc has developed environmental requirements that state all suppliers must comply with applicable laws and
 regulations as well as our social and environmental standards we use a variety of tools to assess suppliers including background checks
 selfassessment surveys site visits and audits we have an enterprisewide supply chain standard that provides guidance to our procurement teams
 on the environmental and social performance of suppliers this includes details on labor discrimination freedom of association health and safety
 the environment management systems and ethics the standard was developed in partnership with key customers socially responsible investment
 funds and nongovernment organizations the council participates as an active member in carbon disclosure projects corporate supply chain
 program which is comprised of more than 31 multinational companies dedicated to managing and reducing ghg emissions within their supply
 chain we continue to increase the number of suppliers reporting their ghg emissions and reduction strategies
 global environmental sustainability council gesc  we continue to find new ways to put structure around our
 sustainability focus the global environmental sustainability council gesc leads efforts to reduce our environmental footprint gain
 competitive advantage through environmentally responsible products and services and improve the ecoefficiency of the supply chain the gesc
 includes executives from all three business units as well as representatives from legal public affairs and health safety and environment its first
 initiative has been to introduce a new enterprisewide environmental sustainability scorecard and metric tracking process the council collects and
 regularly reports environmental data to enior management we are also implementing improved design for sustainability dfs procedures and
 practices to further reduce costs and our environmental footprint these dfs practices are part of our overall lifecycle management lcm effort
 to fully exam our products environmental and economic effects throughout its lifetime including new material extraction transportation
 manufacturing use recycling and disposal such as
  establishing waste energy ghg water and quality targets as discussed in the next section goals
  developing recyclable postindustrial and postconsumer materials through relationships with manufacturers and material converters
  integrating recycled materials into our product lines
  helping our customers and suppliers recycle reclaim and integrate
 further johnson controls is committed to responsible land use that promotes biodiversity and nature conservation when we acquire businesses

 regulatory requirements our land acquisitions are rather rare but when such acquisitions are proposed our environmental and legal experts
 evaluate the community environmental and other issues that may arise and make every attempt to ensure minimal impact

 section two  impact of sustainability trends risks and opportunities
 risks and opportunities
 economic 
 economic risks are detailed in our 10k report
 environmental 
 johnson controls global operations have expended substantial resources both financial and managerial to comply with applicable environmental
 and worker safety laws with the ultimate goal of protecting the environment and our workers it is our sincere belief that we comply with all
 such laws and have appropriate processes in place to foster and ensure compliance historically the citations and related penalties imposed on the
 company have been immaterial
 climate change risks and opportunities
 we and our stakeholders are becoming increasingly aware of the potential risks posed by global warming which are reported in our form 10k
 report with further details provided in our annual response to the carbon disclosure project
 supply chain risks
 as a large company we have thousands of suppliers located throughout the world like many other companies we have become aware of the
 potential risks with some suppliers as a result johnson controls evaluates the potential social and environmental risks associated with our supply
 chain currently we are conducting surveys with some suppliers implementing contract modifications and enhancing supplier oversight to
 ensure we use the best suppliers that pose the least amount of risk we share many of these processes with nongovernment organizations ngos
 to make our processes more effective and transparent
 overall we continue to seek ways to minimize risks though initiatives that often involve stakeholder engagement or consultation with outside
 expertise our approach is to turn risks into opportunities much like we are doing with climate change

 prioritization of key sustainability topics as risks and opportunities
 strategy sustainability and risk assessment at johnson controls

 our strategic planning process fully engages the entire corporation is a dynamic yearround process links closely with our financial planning
 process and is based on our core values strategic initiatives are vetted in a gated process of opportunity assessment strategy development
 business case development action plans with metrics and implementation the risks associated with each opportunity are reviewed in the context
 of the companys current risk appetite key sustainability initiatives are assessed and prioritized using this rigorous process corporate and
 business unit strategic plan development includes a robust annual enterprise risk assessment management and mitigation process erm which
 seeks to identify and manage the top risks that johnson controls and each of its businesses face in a constantly changing world the process starts
 with an update of the current risk universe 106 in total in six key risk areas external strategic operational financial human resources and legal
 and compliance sustainability themes are captured in many related risks like tone at the top business continuity corporate monitoring
 social responsibility and compliance risk each business unit and the corporate leadership team choose the top 50 risks most applicable to their
 current business those risks are then mapped using our automated webbased navigator tool that evaluates each risk in four dimensions
 severity likelihood current organizational effectiveness at dealing with that risk and the velocity of the risk the tool provides broad access and
 fast results compilation which has allowed us to increase participation in the program every year since its inception the system consolidates the
 input and creates a risk heat map of those high velocity risks with the highest likelihood of occurring the largest impact on the company and the
 lowest level of current effectiveness at dealing with that risk the output from the process is discussed in each bu at the senior leadership level
 each business unit picks the 1015 risks that they feel represent the most significant potential impact on their business these may be the top risks
 by formula identified by the navigator tool but in many cases one or two of the top scoring risks are replaced by risks that management feels are
 more pressing these top risks become critical input for the business unit strategic plans and each business builds specific management and

 4 reduce our global environmental foot print
 progress and performance examples on several initiatives that reduce our global foot print follow
  battery recycling  johnson controls continues to lead efforts to ensure that leadacid automotive batteries remain the most recycled consumer
 product in the us we led development of a reverse distribution collection infrastructure and worked with other industries retailers and
 consumers to promote battery recycling today the recycling rate of automotive battery lead exceeds 97 percent far higher than for any other
 recyclable commodity including newspapers 45 percent aluminum beverage cans 55 percent glass bottles 26 percent and tires 26 percent
 recognizing the benefits 48 states require leadacid batteries to be recycled through a takeback program refinements in the process allow for
 plastic battery cases to be recycled as a result leadacid batteries now have a closedloop life cycle in the united states the typical new johnson
 controls battery contains 70 to 80 percent recycled lead and plastic when a spent battery is collected it is sent to a permitted recycler where
 under strict environmental regulations the lead and plastic are reclaimed and sent to a newbattery manufacturer the recycling cycle goes on
 indefinitely which means the battery materials in a given car truck boat or motorcycle have been recycled many times  and will continue to be
 recycled scrap lead from production floors and lead particles captured in environmental control equipment are also collected and returned to
 manufacturers for use in new batteries and other products such as xray shielding in 2008 we launched our ecosteps battery recycling program
 in europe and we continue to work with governments around the globe to embrace us style automotive battery recycling programs
  more efficient buildings  our automotive seating and door panel plant in west point georgia uses 50 percent of its energy from renewable
 sources including hydro biomass solar and wind compared to traditional energy these green energy sources will save the emission of nearly
 7500 metric tons of carbon dioxide over the next six yearsthe equivalent of planting nearly 200000 trees

 johnson controls prepared this report using the global reporting initiative gri g3 sustainability reporting guidelines every attempt was
 made to address each gri element and to provide historical data to help readers observe and understand trends where elements are not
 addressed the primary reasons are lack of reliable data and the need to protect competitively sensitive information

 controls selected information about joint ventures and suppliers is also included

 the basis for reporting remains consistent with earlier reports as noted below

 consolidated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap all significant
 intercompany transactions have been eliminated investments in partiallyowned affiliates are accounted for by the equity method when the

basis for reporting gri 38

3 report parameters  report scope and boundary  basis for reporting gri 38
basis for reporting on joint ventures subsidiaries leased facilities outsourced operations and other entities
that can significantly affect comparability from period to period andor between organizations

  in general considerable precautions are taken to reduce any impact these and any new acquisitions and divestitures have on comparability from
  year to year for example baseline data for greenhouse gas emissions is adjusted per the widely accepted ghg protocol we use a third party to
  review our calculation methods so each year is comparable for data where some annual comparisons are necessary we use sales data as the
  divisor that normalizes the data

  in some cases however errors and omissions are found with data reported in previous years when this occurs the data is corrected and noted in
  the most current report

  further only facilities in which johnson controls has the controlling interest are discussed herein this approach is consistent with earlier year
  reporting to ensure comparability automotive experience and power solutions groups have partially owned affiliates in asia europe and south
  america licensing and joint venture arrangements are also in place with certain manufacturers of automotive parts and batteries outside the
  united states building efficiency has joint ventures in asia europe africa and south america it markets products through distributors
  represented in about 40 countries as noted in our form 10k report attached

policy and current practice with regard to seeking external assurance for the report if not included in the
assurance report accompanying the sustainability report explain the scope and basis of any external
assurance provided also explain the relationship between the reporting organization and the assurance
providers

 johnson controls uses several different thirdparty groups for data assurance the groups selected are independent of johnson controls and are
 specialized in the subject area they review

 for example our consolidated financial statements reported in our form 10k and other related reports are reviewed by pricewaterhousecoopers
 llp an independent registered public accounting firm

 from 2006 to 2010 our energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions data within the united states were independently reviewed by wsp group a
 subcontractor hired by epa climate leaders lessons learned from the audits were applied to our inventory management plan that was used to
 calculate our global energy use and ghg emissions starting with our 2011 data bureau veritas an independent auditor recognized by the
 carbon disclosure project audited our ghg emissions data per iso standard 140643 greenhouse gases  part 3 specification with guidance
 for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions they also audited our water data the objective of the audits is to provide
 further confidence that our reported energy ghg emissions and water data have a low margin of error the certificates for these most recent
 audits are attached as verification statements in supporting references

 other measures used to ensure quality are discussed below
 personnel databases for employment metrics which are checked by routine data reviews performed mostly by human resources personnel
 globally
 the johnson controls proprietary corporate health environment and safety system chess is an internal tool used to track environment
 health and safety data from facilities worldwide data are reviewed routinely by qualified internal personnel and with assistance from a thirdparty
 environmental health and safety and iso consultants
 filings with environmental health and safety and other regulatory agencies are routinely checked internally and by the applicable regulatory
 agency
 written company policies and procedures are periodically reviewed by our internal audit department quality program management and many
 customers
 we discuss and when appropriate use internal or in some cases external expertise to review and audit our suppliers the audits range from self
 audits to actual visits and often include an array of sustainability matters including human rights environmental safety quality transportation
 timeliness etc

 we also participate in the carbon disclosure projects supply chain program which provides annual reports including a discussion about the
 overall quality and completeness of the data they report to cdp similarly johnson controls is also scored on our ghg emissions performance
 and disclosure practices which we used to continually improve

 our insurance carrier marsh usa inc provides an independent review of our safety and risk management programs their annual reports of our
 environmental and safety operations are generally highly favorable resulting in significant premium reductions we also use thirdparty
 consultants and registrars to validate environmental and safety data

 we also used certified registrars to validate and certify our operations to various quality environmental six sigma and safety standards eg iso
 9000 iso 14001 ohsas 18001 etc

 ethical behavior and human rights every year we require an electronic commitment to our ethics policy by management worldwide
 employees use a webbased education program translated into 32 languages with training modules and tests tailored to their specific
 responsibilities compliance with our ethics policy is a condition of employment at johnson controls for all employees we annually review the
 policy to ensure relevancy as the company grows and confronts new business issues in the various geographies in which we operate updates to
 the ethics policy are approved by the board of directors our stakeholders offer valuable insight and guidance relative to our ethical performance
 we consistently engage with organizations that can provide critical and constructive feedback about the policy and our performance we also
 dialogue with stakeholders on a regular basis an anonymous ethics hotline is available to anyone who suspects unethical behavior at the
 company the hotline available 24 hours a day in all major languages is operated by an independent thirdparty vendor through the ethics
 hotline monitoring system we capture all information investigate it and implement improvement actions accordingly

 to ensure our processes are working properly and that employees customers and shareholders understand our ethics policy we systematically
 gather feedback and take action to improve our work environment depending upon the situation we retain a cadre of independent third party
 experts that specialize in a variety of legal human rights diversity equal opportunity requirements etc to investigate or to help review and
 advise us on the matter
 lastly in most countries we are subject to routine inspections that cover a wide array of regulations personnel representing these organizations
 are independent of johnson controls specialized experts often from outside the company are retained or hired on a contract basis to determine

our executive compensation objectives

objectives
three longterm objectives drive the committees decisions regarding the executive compensation elements incentive plan design and award levels
we use multiple compensation elements to reach these objectives and drive our executives to deliver sustained results for our shareholders

1 building shareholder value over the long term
longterm incentive compensation and stockbased opportunities comprise the largest component of our executive officers total direct compensation
consisting of base salary annual incentive target and longterm incentive target as we emphasize compensation that is directly linked with the
creation of shareholder value over the long term

2 delivering sustained strong business and financial results
when determining total direct compensation for each executive officer the committee considers our financial performance and the progress we made
towards successfully executing the longterm strategic plan of the business

3 attracting motivating and retaining a highly qualified and effective executive team
the attraction motivation and retention of top executive talent are critical to our continued success therefore the committee considers executive
compensation levels for similar positions at companies within our compensation peer group

our executive compensation philosophy

in the committees pursuit of our longterm objectives a philosophy built on five principles guides the committee these principles underlie all
decisions that the committee makes regarding the executive compensation elements incentive plan design and award levels

1 shareholder alignment and risk mitigation
to avoid hindering delivery of strong sustainable financial results and the delivery of longterm value to our shareholders compensation should be
structured to align the interests of executive officers with the interests of shareholders and in a manner that does not encourage excessive risk taking to
discourage excessive risktaking the committee conducts an annual risk assessment of our compensation plans and places great emphasis on
equitybased incentive compensation and stock ownership by executive officers

2 pay for performance
a substantial portion of compensation should be variable to reward executive officers for the achievement of strategic financial and leadership
objectives

3 longterm focus
longterm incentive compensation and stock based awards should be designed to drive the achievement of strategic business objectives and increase
shareholder value in the long run

4 aligned to market
total direct compensation should be competitive to attract motivate and retain a highly qualified and effective global executive team that will continue
to drive our success

5 incentive pay alignment and responsibility
as an executive officers level of responsibility increases the target percentage of compensation that is at risk and oriented toward longterm
performance should increase accordingly

each year the committee determines the appropriate level of compensation for all executive officers as an initial guideline the committee sets the
total direct compensation opportunity base salary annual incentive target and longterm incentive target for each of our executive officers within a
range  15 around the 50th percentile of the compensation peer group or where data from the peer group is not available general industry
survey data the variation of actual pay relative to the market data is dependent on the executive officers performance experience knowledge skills
level of responsibility potential to impact our performance and future success and the need to retain and motivate strategic talent

approach gri 411
explanation of whether and how the precautionary approach or principle is addressed by the organization

 we have a robust risk management staff to identify and recommend ways to mitigate risks inherent in our activities including those associated
 with acquisitions or divestitures on many occasions we forego potentially profitable work that is inconsistent with our core business and values
 senior management makes such decisions with input from functional areas including legal and risk management

 please see the risk management process document attached below in the supporting references this document describes the robust risk
 management process in place to identify risks across the company this process facilitates the identification of the changing risks which then
 focus the company on how to plan for management of such risks

 we also take the precautionary approach when risks including those associated with environmental or worker safety outweigh overall value to
 the business we used a comprehensive due diligence checklist for evaluating risks associated with an acquisition also significant changes to
 processes materials etc often involve internal multifunctional reviews and approvals once a new process or acquisition occurs then per
 company policy it becomes subject to a multitude of quality environmental and safety checks and improvement systems in accordance with our
 management system approach for example all of johnson controls facilities per corporate mandate are required to have an environmental
 management system in place that is at least compliant with iso 14001 many of our facilities also are compliant or certified to iso 9000
 business management system and ohsas 18001 safety management system also our business operating system bos allows for quick
 efficient and consistent implementation of these systems we have shared our success in implementing these systems with some interested
 customers

 also we continue to focus on supply chain risks and have performed surveys and audits of key suppliers to ensure they meet our expectations
 the supplier manual applicable to suppliers is attached and includes contractual clauses regarding sustainability ie human rights environmental
 etc

 johnson controls is an early signatory and active member of the united nations global compact which is a framework for businesses that are
 committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights labor the environment
 and corruption as the worlds largest global corporate citizenship initiative the global compact is first and foremost concerned with exhibiting
 and building the social legitimacy of business and markets we are committed to its ten principles which are aligned with the ilo conventions
 oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises and the un universal declaration of human rights
 we abide by the ten principles of the un global compact which are
 1 support and respect the protection of international human rights within their sphere of influence
 2 refuse to participate or condone human rights abuses

 6 eliminate discrimination in employment and occupation
 7 implement a precautionary approach to environmental challenges
 8 undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility
 9 promote the diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies
 10 promote adoption of initiatives to counter all forms of corruption including extortion and bribery

 johnson controls reports annually to the communication on progress cop which is a voluntary requirement for remaining in good standing
 with the un global compact a cop is a communication to stakeholders ie consumers employees organized labor shareholders
 nongovernment organizations social investors media government etc on the progress the company has made in implementing the ten
 principles in their business activities and where appropriate supporting un goals through partnerships

 more than 55000 of our managers and key employees around the world are trained annually on our ethics policy which addresses each compact
 principle and is conveyed to employees through training and other initiatives

 an initiative of the compact is caring for climate which johnson controls fully supports the initiative is positioned as a voluntary and
 complementary action platform for those global compact participants who want to demonstrate leadership on the climate change issue johnson
 controls is showing its support by establishing greenhouse gas reduction goals that are reported annually to the public we feel our support shows
 how committed we are to advancing practical solutions public opinion and government attitudes about climate change

 in addition johnson controls was an active member of climate leaders a us epa industrygovernment partnership that works with companies
 to develop comprehensive climate change strategies as a partner company johnson controls committed to reducing our impact on the global
 environment by completing a corporatewide inventory of greenhouse gas emissions based on a quality management system setting aggressive
 reduction goals and annually reporting their progress to epa our participation provided a credible record of our accomplishments and epa
 recognition as corporate environmental leader in addressing climate change since that program has closed johnson controls has joined the better
 buildings challenge an initiative that brings together corporations universities municipalities and other national leaders to make significant
 commitments to energy efficiency and waste reduction in their facilities

 launched by president obama in december 2011 the goal of the challenge is to make american commercial and industrial buildings at least 20
 percent more energy efficient by 2020

 as a better buildings challenge partner johnson controls will work with the us department of energy to implement energy savings practices
 that reduce energy waste and save money the company will also share facilitylevel energy use data and successful strategies with challenge
 partners and other us businesses and organizations  helping to lead a clean sustainable energy economy

 johnson controls also supports full transparency greenhouse gas emissions reporting for example johnson controls publicly reports its ghg
 data on our web as well as to the carbon disclosure project cdp a nongovernment organization that solicits ghg data from all major
 corporations and posts the data on their web for public viewing we have provided data for many years and became a member of cdps supply
 chain leadership collaboration in 2008 to encourage our suppliers to do the same to date our responses have been well received by the ngo
 community for example calvert ceres and cdp stated in their report titled climate risk disclosure by sp 500 that johnson controls
 led the multisector industry with highest level of disclosure providing more information than any other sp 500 company except entergy the
 company stated that it is a global leader in providing energy efficiency products and services at the same time johnson controls did not neglect
 to address risk and it offered higher than average disclosure in its strategic analysis of the potential implications of climate change in 2010 we
 were recognized by cdp by being listed on their carbon disclosure leadership indexes and carbon performance leadership indexes which only
 includes the companies with the highest scores in the two categories of the carbonintensive sectors and the noncarbonintensive sectors to
 provide a perspective on the range and quality of responses to cdps questionnaire
 johnson controls is also a member of the center for climate  energy solutions c2es  formerly pew center business environmental
 leadership council as a member we are committed to the following principles
 1 we accept the scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and that the impacts are already being felt delaying action will increase
 both the risks and the costs

 2 businesses can and should incorporate responses to climate change into their core corporate strategies by taking concrete steps in the us and
 abroad to establish and meet greenhouse gas ghg emission reduction targets andor invest in low and zero ghg products practices and
 technologies
 3 the united states should significantly reduce its ghg emissions through economywide mandatory approaches which may vary by economic
 sector and include a flexible marketbased program complementary policies may also be necessary for sectors such as buildings electricity
 generation forestry agriculture and transportation that will help drive innovation and ease the transition to a lowcarbon economy
 4 climate change is a global challenge that ultimately requires a global solution an international climate framework must establish fair
 effective and binding commitments for all developed and major developing economies johnson controls signed the copenhagen communique
 in september 2009 and cancun communique in september 2010 in an effort to show support for the cop15 and cop16 unfcc climate change
 conferences in dec 2009 and dec 2010 see supporting references for its principles

 johnson controls became a member of the climate group in september 2009 as a condition of membership our ceo signed onto their
 principles which demonstrate a commitment to environmental responsibility and actions to reduce the companys carbon emissions

 johnson controls is also an active advocate of promoting diversity within our workforce and supply chain we are on of eighteen us companies

  activities plans and strategies which is critical for our longterm success we consult with stakeholders via periodic meetings advisory council
  forums written correspondence and surveys some benefits resulting directly from stakeholder engagement include

   enhancing best practices particularly in the social arena
   improving data benchmarking so it is more easily understood
   learning about new marketing opportunities and gaining a balanced perspective of our activities and potential consequences
   establishing more efficient processes for tracking progress on several new sustainability related goals

  expectations of all stakeholders we have identified our key stakeholders engagement with some is new continuing and in many cases expanding
  all usually with the focus on conveying the importance of sustainability to our business

key topics and concerns that have been raised through stakeholder engagement and how the organization
has responded to those key topics and concerns including through its reporting

 customer employee and other types of surveys are routinely conducted to determine those areas where we can improve which is essential for the
 continued success of the company results of key customer and employee surveys recently conducted are provided in the supporting documents
 below

 johnson controls is listed on many of the global sustainability indexes such as the dow jones sustainability index north america and world
 ftse4good index series kld index series including the global climate 100 and the domini 400 social index the calvert social index
 maplecroft climate innovation index and the disclosure index for the carbon disclosure project being listed on these prestigious indices reflects
 our strong commitment to sustainability transparency integrity governance human rights community involvement environmental leadership
 etc overall being recognized for our leadership in sustainability better positions us for continued success

 johnson controls meets and cooresponds with a variety of stakeholders including nongovernment organizations ngos to get their input on an
 array of matters for instance johnson controls meets with several members of the interfaith center for corporate responsibility iccr to
 discuss specific current and emerging issues that affect or may affect the company topics discussed include human rights policies sustainability
 reporting supply chain management climate change and our gri report 

 for example in 2003 the iccr issued a shareholder resolution requesting that we publish a sustainability report at that time johnson controls
 had already published its first annual environmental safety and health report and was considering expanding the report to include more social
 information as data collection processes became more refined the resolution did not secure the minimum shareholder proxy votes but johnson
 controls agreed to ongoing dialogue with iccr and published a sustainability report in january 2004 covering fiscal 2003 the report was a
 companywide success it received considerable praise from employees and customers and helped us to better appreciate the business value of
 sustainability reporting in 2005 we combined our sustainability report with our annual report and created a summary report called the
 business and sustainability report to complement the printed summary and in an effort to be fully transparent we annually updated an online
 gri matrix report that followed the global reporting initiative gri 2002 guidelines starting in 2008 we followed the newly introduced gri
 g3 guidelines the online report is intended to provide details about our economic environmental and social performance for all stakeholders

 prior to updating this online report for the current year we asked iccr to review our latest gri report and provide comments to help us improve
 it johnson controls sincerely appreciates iccrs efforts for reviewing and providing comments we believe their input helps us improve and
 gives us a competitive edge by allowing us to better understand our stakeholders and the marketplace each comment was reviewed and every
 attempt was made to address their comments in this updated version particularly those that add value or do not jeopardize information considered
 company confidential

 in addition we keep domini social investments waldon asset management and many other social investors apprised of our sustainability
 efforts for example in 2004 domini social investments inc and members of the iccr asked johnson controls to investigate the social and
 environmental activities of doe runperu one of our minor lead suppliers the investigation revealed that the supplier purchased a problem
 facility from the peruvian government in 1997 and had spent millions on improvement that were not being recognized by various local ngos a
 meeting with doe runperus top management johnson controls iccr and domini helped all parties better understand each others concerns
 and the progress actually being made as a result johnson controls reviewed its supply chain management process and made improvements to its
 supply chain management practices that we feel will help minimize our exposure to many supply chain risks the doe run peru facility closed for
 several years and recently reopened

 we will continue our overall supply chain management process with interested stakeholders as appropraite

 in the timeframe of 2008  2010 iccr and another prominent social investor requested an explanation about allegations that johnson controls
 discriminated against its employees when laying off employees at its puebla facility in mexico in 2010 a third party investigation was conducted
 by the independent auditor verite and noted several findings a corrective action plan was devised and implemented an executive summary of
 the audit and corrective action plan was shared and discussed with iccr and other interested social investors and stakeholders we have also
 appointed a full time individual to monitor corective plan implementation and to work closely with employees and unions to prevent a
 reoccurrence facility supervisory personnel have been retrained as well further we discussed our new human rights  sustainability policy
 with iccr and they provided input for improving it that we incorporated in the new policy

 in september 2011 some local chinese media reported that our shanghai battery plant was being held responsible for lead contamination in the
 local community on sept 13 the pudong new area government requested that johnson controls suspend leadrelated production in our
 shanghai plant as we achieved our lead quota for the year and we complied with this request johnson controls took immediate steps to minimize
 the impact of this action on our employees we fully cooperated with the government and industry experts to understand and help address this
 issue we asked industry experts in china to do a formal investigation of the bloodlead poisoning issue this independent investigation
 conducted by the leadacid battery subcommission of the china electric equipment industry association indicated that johnson controls
 could not be the cause of the elevated bloodlead levels that have been found in some children in the kangqiao area pudong shanghai the
 results corroborated our own data and proved that emissions from our battery plant could not be the cause of elevated bloodlead levels found in
 the community the independent panel was led by mr xia qing an environmental scientist and former deputy chairman and chief engineer of
 china research academy of environmental science and included several experts in environmental protection health soil remediation and the

  leadacid battery industry the panel investigated potential sites that could have contributed to the elevated bloodlead incidents in the kangqiao
  area it also analyzed the various lead sources and the potential pathways from these sites to the environment in the nearby community

  while the study indicated that johnson controls could not be the cause of the bloodlead incidents in kangqiao it did identify an abnormally high
  zone of lead content from a waste recycling facility near the residential area where 80 percent of the affected children live in this contaminated
  area lead content was found to be over three times the present chinese national standard and 10 times the forthcoming chinese national standard
  it is also found that the zinc content of this area was over 15 times the present chinese national standards

  johnson controls has a longterm commitment to china we will continue to work with the government in a transparent and cooperative manner
  focusing on scientifically assessing the environmental issues in kangqiao while responding to the needs of the community our employees and our
  customers

  johnson controls has responded to social investors on this issue and is keeping them up to date on the latest information in the spirit of
  transparency with our external stakeholders around the world

  in late 2012 walden asset management and a group of social investors inquired about our lead management practices in mexico we responded
  to their concerns and are continuing the dialogue with them please see attachment in supporting references for our response

         economic performance
         market presence and
         indirect economic impacts


 economic performance

 2012 performance
 2012 was a year of continued growth and success for johnson controls johnson controls achieved a record 42 billion in revenues and 18
 billion of adjusted earnings in fiscal 2012 our history of posting earnings growth now extends to 21 of the past 22 years we continued to pay a
 dividend to our shareholders as we have done every year since 1887 further we increased the annual dividend once again this year

 having achieved these results despite a weak global economy we are proud
 of our financial performance while we were optimistic about growth across
 all our businesses coming into 2012 the macroeconomic environment was
 more difficult than we forecast

 we entered 2012 with record backlogs in our automotive experience
 business the north american auto market was positive but its strong
 demand was offset by continued weakness in the european auto market
 our metals and mechanisms segments in automotive experience were
 hampered by the sluggish european economy as well as performance issues
 that we are addressing

 our power solutions business benefitted from solid demand for batteries in
 europe in north america however mild winter weather slowed demand for
 aftermarket automobile batteries

 the soft global markets also impacted our building efficiency business we
 had record backlogs coming into the year but momentum slowed as the
 year progressed in the united states education health care and public
 sector institutional markets all declined 15 percent in 2012 despite the slow
 revenue growth profitability improved in the second half of the year as the
 business responded to market conditions and implemented cost reductions
 and pricing initiatives

 johnson controls ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth is driven by our longterm strategies ability to execute plans and our
 diversification through three businesses that are market leaders in their respective industries each has demonstrated the ability to grow
 significantly faster than its industry growth rate

 investments
 we continue to make investments that will strengthen our ability to serve our customers and support longterm growth in 2012 we made capital
 investments of 18 billion across our businesses

 in power solutions our investment focused on global market expansion and vertical integration we proudly opened our first battery recycling

 indirect economic impacts

 johnson controls indirect economic impacts are broad and effect many different stakeholders for example our employees private spending
 generates economic activity and taxes and supports their local communities our supply chain spending creates jobs for supplier companies as
 well as those suppliers and associated infrastructure that support them most all pay taxes to governments and pay dividends to their investors and
 many directly and indirectly provide various types of support to their local communities the equipment and services we sell to customers
 improve their productivity which may increase their economic contribution to society through greater employment more purchases from their
 suppliers and more taxes also our investors often pay taxes on stock gains when they sell their shares

 we invest in jobs training programs including green jobs training in certain cities where we have operations this provides an indirect ecnomic
 impact for those regions

 through commitments with ngos public and private sector entities we develop partnerships to implement carbon reduction measures in
 commercial buildings such actions provide indirect economic impacts through energy savings

 in addition our global philanthropic efforts including our blue sky involve employee volunteer program contribute to the indirect economic
 impacts by lifting up the nonprofit organizations in local communities the company provides grants to these local nonprofits and schools when
 our employees volunteer to participate in projects that help the nonprofit organizations many of these organizations are in need for physical
 improvements to their facilities or providing leadership skills training for their stakeholders which often are the local citizens our global
 philanthropy was 139 million in fy2012 which has both a direct and indirect economic impact on local communities of that total 1350000
 was directed towards the more than 1350 local blue sky involve volulnteer projects with the nonprofit organizations and schools that our
 employees selected the dollars being invested locally are a direct impact but the employee volunteer portion provides the indirect impact as the
 employees teach the local stakeholders how to prosper better on their own through leadership and life skills

financial implications and other risks and opportunities for the organizations activities due to climate
change

 risks andor opportunities eg financial market legal regulatory physical faced as a result of climate change

     have been assessed and are publicly available please upload web addressdocuments                                                         c2

     have not been assessed

 details of financial implications risks and opportunities faced as a result of climate change
 at johnson controls we acknowledge the scientific consensus that the earth is warming and that it is at least partially caused by the
 actions of man the current body of scientific evidence suggests that climate change will not result in a single devastating event but rather
 a combination of events along with uncertainly as to where these events will occur and the degree of impact even with this uncertainty
 johnson controls like many of its stakeholders recognizes the need to question how climate change could impact our continued success
 as a result we have and will continue to discuss internally and with numerous ngos trade groups and other professional organizations
 the potential risks and opportunities of climate change in order to understand and minimize such risks based on those discussions we
 attempted to provide some insight into what we see on the horizon for each major climate change risk category commonly identified by
 groups involved with assessing climate change risks

 operational risk disruption of company operations
 we recognize that risks such as coastal flooding weather pattern irregularities food and water shortages disease outbreaks could impact
 our company as well as our customers and suppliers although the location and degree of such repercussions of global warming have yet
 to be identified johnson controls remains committed to staying informed to allow for adequate risk mitigation planning as a global
 leader in providing energy efficiency products and services however we foresee more demand for our products and services as our
 customers more fully recognize that energy efficiency is the most cost effective way to reduce ghg emissions

 we are working closely with the carbon disclosure project corporate supply chain program to identify the types of risks and
 opportunities that may exist in our supply chain some possible risks include disruptions and cost increases for the materials and
 commodities used for our products and services defining the impacts of this risk remains highly speculative for the long term however
 given that our products and services are largely focused on energy efficiency etc that will help reduce ghgs we see more opportunities
 than risks for the long term

 in any case we currently see and are experiencing many new opportunities as consumer attitudes and demand continue to focus on energy
 efficiency more fuel efficient hybrids and other technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which are the focus of many of our
 products and services in other words we see more opportunities to the bottom line than risks for the foreseeable future for johnson
 controls overall

 insurance risk increased premiums andor uninsurability
 the implications of global warming are well documented by the ipcc even if their moderate predications prove correct they will affect
 johnson controls for example the ipcc study reported on a number of gloomy scenarios such as coastal flooding weather pattern
 irregularities food and water shortages and disease outbreaks in the more severely impacted areas decisions to construct new or maintain
 existing facilities in some areas will involve examining the environmental costs and risks that could impact profits and loss of margins
 due to increases in insurance and other operational costs could lead to relocating facilities to areas where these costs are lower although
 the full repercussions of global warming have yet to be fully identified we remain committed to staying informed to allow for adequate
 risk mitigation planning
 further our insurance carrier marsh values our transparency and leadership efforts in sustainability which has resulted in premium rate
 reductions over recent years

 regulatory risk regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and ensuing compliance costs
 johnson controls views measures to constrain carbon consumption including regulations as positive for our long term growth and for
 reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions globally our business includes making buildings more energy efficient manufacturing lighter
 vehicle interiors to enhance fuel efficiency and developing new types of batteries for hybrid vehicles we anticipate more demand for our
 products and services as the demand for energy efficiency grows either as a result of costs or enactment of new regulations for example
 citigroup reported johnson controls to be one of twelve major corporations most likely to benefit as carbon becomes more constrained
 and is taking steps to meet this demand by actively investing in new products and services to improve energy efficiency and reduce ghg
 emissions globally

 nonetheless we recognize that applicable carbon regulations and permitting requirements could impact siting and other decisions for new
 and existing facilities these and other risks will continue to be evaluated whenever new facilities are proposed even though the impacts
 identified to date have been considered material on our financial soundness or plans for future growth
 we believe that significant action is needed in the shortterm to mitigate the causes and begin adapting to the negative risks and actual
 impacts of global warming we believe the highest priority actions should be improving energy efficiency in buildings and vehicles which

 represent the fastest cleanest and most costeffective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

 we believe that a comprehensive global climate policy is needed backed by strong national policies goals and actions we believe that the
 price of energy should reflect the environmental costs of consumption allowing market economics to lead the shift to cleaner alternatives
 and new technologies we support a variety of marketbased approaches to regulating carbon emissions that assure the integrity of the
 reductions and are efficient in their implementation

 we also believe that a complementary set of energy policies are needed to overcome market barriers to energy efficiency accelerate
 emission reductions and reduce the overall cost of compliance to businesses and consumers these policies include updated building
 codes building performance labeling financial incentives for energy efficiency retrofits and a national energy efficiency resource
 standard in the vehicle sector incentives are also required to build an effective supplychain for largescale manufacturing of
 nextgeneration advanced technology batteries and electric drive vehicles
 we believe that timely adoption of comprehensive energy and climate legislation will reduce economic and regulatory uncertainty and
 allow companies to better manage both risks and opportunities related to climate change these uncertainties include emission reduction
 requirements energy price volatility energyintensive materials pricing carbon offset monetization opportunities and the impact of
 building efficiency codes standards and incentives uncertainties related to the impact of climate change would also be reduced including
 the future cost of adaptation availability of resources and the potential for climaterelated business disruption

 further we see johnson controls benefiting from internal agency mandates for example a january 2007 executive order from president
 bush requires federal agencies to improve energy efficiency and reduce ghg emissions in their operations through reduction of energy
 intensity by 3 percent annually through the end of fiscal year 2015 or 30 percent by the end of fiscal year 2015 relative to the baseline of
 the agencys energy use in fiscal year 2003 almost a dozen federal agencies and departments now require all new construction projects
 and substantial renovations to be certified through the leadership in energy and environmental design leed green building rating
 system of the us green building council projects are encouraged to exceed basic leed green building certification and achieve the
 leed silver level the federal government owns approximately 445000 buildings and leases an additional 57000 buildingsthe
 largest real estate portfolio in the world additionally more than 500 mayors signed the us mayors climate protection agreement that
 was initiated by seattle mayor greg nickels in 2005 the agreement commits participating cities to reduce co2 emissions to 1990 levels
 and matching the goals of the kyoto protocol outside the united states efforts to implement energy efficiency are more regulated due to
 the kyoto protocol which is providing further opportunities for us in general we view most mandates regulations and incentives that
 promote energy efficiency and conservation as positive

 shareholder risk shareholder activism and disruption
 johnson controls remains committed in being transparent by publicly reporting its greenhouse gas emissions we currently report our
 emissions in our annual business and sustainability report and global reporting initiative gri report which are both available on our
 public web site

 we also report our emissions to the carbon disclosure project cdp by completing both its investor and supplier questionnaires and
 granting full approval for sharing the data publicly our gri report and the cdp questionnaire also provide consider insight into our
 specific emissions and climate change initiatives processes and strategies reviews of our responses have been highly positive for
 example calvert ceres and cdp stated in their january 2007 report titled climate risk disclosure by sp 500 that johnson
 controls led the multisector industry with highest level of disclosure providing more information than any other sp 500 company
 except entergy the company stated that it is a global leader in providing energy efficiency products and services at the same time
 johnson controls did not neglect to address risk and it offered higher than average disclosure in its strategic analysis of the potential
 implications of climate change
 as a member of cdps corporate supply chain programme we ask many of our suppliers to report their ghg data to cdp although we
 continue to be ranked as having the highest number suppliers reporting as compared to other members we feel that there is still
 considerable room for improvement in the depth and breadth of supplier reported data we hope that our continued efforts will help our
 suppliers recognize the importance of monitoring their ghg emissions to reduce risks and costs as well as come to appreciate how
 johnson controls products and services can help them do just that

 we intend to continue our partnerships with several prestigious organizations focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions including the
 us better plants challenge the business roundtable climate resolve the carbon disclosure project cdp corporate supply chain
 programme c2ess business environmental leadership council and as signatories to the united nations global compacts ten
 principles and the caring for climate initiative as well as the copenhagen communiqué we strongly believe our involvement in these
 organizations will help us understand and quickly mitigate shareholder risks associated with climate change

 litigation risk costs resulting from climate litigation
 the levels of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations are low and as such we believe our exposure to ghg related
 litigation is relatively low compared to large emitters at least for the near term we will continue to monitor how ghg litigation
 progresses globally and will implement the appropriate mitigation measures to further limit our exposure however our current strategy
 will continue to be full compliance with applicable laws and transparency of our ghg strategies as the best way to minimize litigation
 risks

 capital risk inability to raise capital
 increased certainty in energy and climate policy will stimulate additional demand for energy efficient buildings vehicles and other
 johnson controls products and services which in turn will require the training education and employment of a greatly expanded
 workforce businesses and institutions will improve the efficiency of their facilities and fleets their internal operations and their supply
 chains yielding both economic and environmental benefits for johnson controls and its customers it will also stimulate greater investment
 in clean energy research and development providing competitive benefits for participating businesses on a global basis

  competitive risk loss of economic opportunity
  even with the difficult economic climate experienced recently we feel our continued focus on our core values including sustainability
  will ensure our continued success for many years to come we will continue to drive down our cost structure while balancing investments
  for long term growth the global market megatrends in energy efficiency sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction favorably position
  us for future growth johnson controls has the global presence and customer relationships that allow us to continue to lead industry
  change we have the financial strength to accelerate our investments in growth both organically as well as through acquisitions we have
  positioned the company for the sustainable profitable growth that has long been a hallmark of johnson controls

  reputational risk
  our sustainability performance has been recognized by inclusion in several of the most respected corporate social responsibility and
  sustainability investment indices including djsi world and djsi north america ftse4good index series calvert social index
  carbon disclosure projects carbon disclosure leadership indexes global 500 and sp 500 domini 400 social index kld global
  climate 100 index and eight other kld social indexes and maplecroft climate innovation indexes ranked 5 also newsweek
  magazine ranked johnson controls as a green company among americas 500 largest corporations fortune magazine recognized us again
  as one of americas most admired companies ethisphere magazine named us as one of worlds most ethical companies cr
  corporate responsibility magazine listed us as again as one of the 100 best corporate citizens in 2011 we received the 1 ranking and
  in 2012 the 5 ranking we are also recognized as one of americas most shareholderfriendly companies by institutional investor
  magazine we have also received numerous customer awards and awards from professional organizations such as the prestigious corenet
  global award for industry excellence award for service delivery for our global workplace knowledge center gwk which supports
  corporate real estate clients in 12000 locations across 70 countries

  although not all of these awards are linked to our to climate change initiatives such recognition is perhaps reflective of our continued
  commitment towards transparency which we see as vital for a maintaining a positive image and understanding what stakeholders want so
  we can react appropriately

  overall as a global leader in providing energy efficiency products and services however we foresee more demand for our products and
  services as our customers more fully recognize that energy efficiency is the most cost effective way to reduce ghg emissions

 sourcing events to ensure overall supplier capability verify suppliers approach to health and safety
 environmental and other key aspects that would support operational excellence

 various automotive interiors components about 30 of this groups current global spend amount is sourced
 in the developing world either as support to local operations or as exports this amount is expected to grow
 to 50 over the next five years commensurate with growth in these developing regions and also providing
 sourcing opportunities for suppliers within the regions in which we serve another emerging trend is
 purchasing renewable materials that can be incorporated into automotive interiors products including hemp
 and soy based materials that are sustainable sources

additional comments
in april 2006 the corporate standard that provides ethics policy guidance to procurement and other personnel regarding the environmental and social
performance of suppliers was implemented companywide each business has established processes to ensure compliance with the standard and
appropriate additionsmodifications are being taken full implementation of the standard occurred during 2007 for some business units
implementation includes modifications to the supplier manual audit criteria processes for collecting and reporting metrics and discussions with
suppliers

in addition selfaudit questionnaires have and continue to be sent to key suppliers in each business the questionnaires continue to be reviewed for
discrepancies that are discussed with the supplier to ensure continuous improvement depending on the business unit improvements in the supply
chain management process have included training of some suppliers adding specific social and environmental language to contracts and associated
global supply manual and discussions with numerous suppliers about environmental and social expectations

                           johnson controls operations and facilities have been and in
                           the future may become the subject of formal or informal
                           enforcement actions or proceedings for noncompliance with
                           such laws or for the remediation of companyrelated
                           substances released into the environment such matters
                           typically are resolved by negotiation with regulatory
                           authorities that result in commitments to compliance
                           abatement or remediation programs and in some cases
                           payment of penalties historically no such commitments
                           penalties and associated impacts either direct or indirect
                           have been material or significant

                           overall the negative impact of our activities are relatively
                           insignificant due to the type of operations we perform and
                           the various environmental and social activities
                           implemented

                           one area of potential negative economic impact would be
                           from a change in location of operations or activities due to
                           an economic downturn which the world is currently
                           experiencing an economic downturn can result in plant
                           closings or consolidations in a certain region these type of
                           job reductions would be necessary for the health and
                           longterm viability of the company the company has the
                           fiscal responsibility to react appropriately to the current
                           economic climate in any given region at the end of our
                           fiscal year in 2008 and into fiscal year 2009 the company
                           performed downsizing in all three of our business units but
                           most drastically in the automotive experience business unit
                           due to the severe downturn in automobile production in the
                           last half of 2008 and in 2009 all major oem automotive
                           companies slashed production in virtually every country in
                           the world the companys automotive experience business
                           had to manage its business by cutting operations costs to
                           adjust to the automotive market dropping by about 50
                           compared to previous years the company tried to keep as
                           much infrastructure as possible but plant closings and
                           layoffs were necessary to keep the business alive and
                           healthy in these unprecedented times the business has also
                           had to move some of its operations to lower cost countries
                           such as slovakia and other eastern european countries to
                           keep costs in line with the changing market

                           the reduction of jobs in such industries and regions will
                           have a negative direct and indirect impact on the

 create a more sustainable world and helping our customers to do the same we have long considered ourselves to be environmental stewards

 our businesses by their very nature contribute to environmental quality the products we make and the services we deliver help customers save
 energy reduce pollution waste less and recycle more we educate employees to become better guardians of the environment on the job as well as
 in their communities we are focusing on our own operations looking for ways to produce products in more earthfriendly ways and to make our
 factories and offices environmentally benign we are dedicated to making cars more fuel efficient through advanced battery technology and
 environmentally friendly interior components we make buildings greener through technologies and services that consume less energy cause
 less pollution and use resources efficiently

 the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with environmental laws and worker
 safety laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance certain of the companys businesses are or have been engaged
 in the handling or use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment the company is committed to protecting its
 workers and the environment against the risks associated with these substances

 materials
 material recycling and reuse  through the sourcing recycling and reuse of automotive interior materials we ensure that the
 performance of our engineered materials is compatible with protecting the environment johnson controls has developed a portfolio of substrates
 upholstery and surface materials for interior components that always takes into consideration the specific needs that each of these materials must
 fulfill every material must meet functional requirements such as resistance to wear and tear and easy care and the look and feel of the materials
  plus the way they are combined with one another  play an important role in helping to make vehicle occupants feel comfortable at the same
 time we are dedicated to using our natural resources in a responsible way that always complies with environmental regulations this is especially
 true in the initial development stages of new products when we develop product assembly processes that focus on easyto disassemble structures
 using recyclable and reusable materials the expertise of our materials specialists enables us to proactively meet emerging environmental
 standards and legal requirements in this way we remain focused on helping our customers meet their environmental performance goals in this
 way we can achieve optimal conditions in production and at the end of our products life cycles

 johnson controls supplies seat foam pads made partially from soybean oil by using an abundant renewable material source this new proprietary
 technology decreases the use of petroleum products with their inherent market price fluctuations and negative environmental effects to the
 consumer theres no difference between our soybased seat and one using traditional materials except for the environmental benefits our
 engineers put the soy technology through rigorous comparison testing to evaluate durability shape and comfort levels we are continuing to
 develop ways to increase the amount of soybean composition in our pads and are applying lessons learned today to create more earthfriendly
 products of the future

 battery recycling  leadacid automotive batteries are one of most highly recycled consumer products with return rates frequently
 exceeding 95 percent in the united states in the united states closedloop battery recycling is well established heres how it works a johnson
 controls truck leaves one of our battery manufacturing plants with a load of new batteries when those batteries are dropped off at a customer site
 the truck picks up the old spent batteries those batteries are delivered to a smelter where the plastic cases are ground down for later reuse in

 new battery cases the lead plates are removed and melted down into ingots the truck leaves the smelter with a load of recycled lead and delivers
 it back to our battery plant where the lead is turned into a key component of a new battery while the process is somewhat different in europe the
 result is much the same reuse of the major battery components again and again asias auto battery industry is quickly developing as more and
 more autos are produced currently there is a fragmented infrastructure for the recycling of the increasing number of used batteries but we are
 educating and sharing best to encourage a more systemize approach towards battery recycling

 energy and services
 energy efficiency and green buildings  johnson controls is the worlds largest energy efficiency provider saving billions of
 dollars of energy costs for customers when energy efficiency increases its not only the utility bill that decreases  so do the greenhouse gas
 emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuels our core building efficiency offerings help customers reduce energy use our hvac
 systems integrate hundreds of components in a building providing comfort and safety while using the minimum amount of energy possible
 mechanical equipment with variable speed motors use onethird less energy than it did just five years ago our services ensure that everything in
 the building continues running at optimal efficiency customers such as school districts and government buildings often dont have the budgets to
 pay upfront for energy efficiency improvements we provide them with performance contracting solutions under which the facility improvements
 are funded over time out of the energy and operational savings generated by the project we guarantee the savings so the customer can be assured
 of reaching the promised reductions improvements can reduce energy consumption by as much as 50 percent johnson controls is a long
 recognized leader in developing environmentally friendly green buildings that are energy efficient use less water and reduce waste our
 involvement with green buildings enables us to redefine building performance in terms of environmental and economic returns

 our residential comfort systems improve home comfort and energy efficiency for the north american residential market we provide air
 conditioning and heating systems under the york luxaire and coleman brand names a new gas furnace modulates airflow to closely match
 the amount of heat needed creating more consistent air temperatures and lower noise with a 95 percent energy efficiency rating

 our building efficiency headquarters in milwaukee wisconsin was one of the worlds first certified green buildings when it opened in 2002 and
 weve continually made improvements to its energy and environmental performance it is leed gold certified our corporate hq campus in
 glendale wisconsin was recently upgraded and expanded and is recognized as the largest concentration of leed platinum buildings in
 existence in addition our burscheid germany facility uses onsite renewable energy and the red oak iowa manufacturing facility won the 2010
 department of energy save energy now award for implementing energy savings activities discovered through an energy audit all of these
 activities and other efficiency improvements continue to drive us towards our commitment of reducing ghg intensity across all of our operations
 also we continue to implement energy efficiency upgrades at our manufacturing plants generating millions of dollars a year in reduced utility
 bills and reducing greenhouse gas emissions


 we are working with the clinton climate initiatives energy efficiency building retrofit program which is dedicated to reducing energy
 consumption and ghg emissions in existing public and private buildings worldwide through this program johnson controls was selected by a
 number of building owners as one of the energy services companies to proceed to a detailed study or contract phrase on projects around the world

 hybrid vehicle batteries  our commitment to improving energy efficiency doesnt stop at buildings we are positioned to be the
 leading supplier of lithiumion battery technology for the next generation of hybrid vehicles lithiumion batteries will begin to replace the nickel
 metalhydride battery chemistry found in hybrid vehicles on the road today currently we are the worlds leading manufacturer of lead acid
 batteries producing more than 130 million per year in addition to manufacturing weve led the development of a reverse distribution collection
 infrastructure and are the global leader in closed loop lead acid battery recycling that means that each time we drop off new batteries at a
 customers site we pick up the used batteries and deliver them to a recycling center our ongoing efforts have helped to make lead acid batteries
 the most recycled product in the united states with 97 of all used batteries being recycled each new battery that is produced contains between
 60 and 80 recycled lead and plastic while the acid is converted into raw materials that can be used in detergents and cleaners

 our commitment to safely recycling and manufacturing batteries goes well beyond the borders of the united states we use the same closed loop
 recycling process in canada brazil mexico and europe our new recycling facility in garcia mexico meets the new us epa standards for
 lead emissions in addition to that we are building a state of the art recycling facility in south carolina that will also exceed the new government
 regulations ensuring the safety of our people and the planet

 jci has also developed a new patented stamped grid technology that improves a lead acid batteries performance and extends battery life the
 production process is virtually waste free with unused materials continually being recycled into the manufacturing process in addition to this it
 uses 20 less energy to produce than a traditional grid reducing ghg emissions while improving product performance

 beyond the manufacture of traditional lead acid batteries the power solutions division is working hard to develop advanced technology products
 to work in startstop hybrid and electric vehicles our new agm battery is used in startstop vehicles and improves fuel efficiency  supports
 emissions reductions of 5  10 by turning off the vehicle when it is at idle annualy we produce 45m agm batteries for the european market
 with opportunities for growth in north america and china we have sold more than 18 million absorbent glass mat agm batteries since the
 technology launched in 2001

 startstop vehicle technology has taken off in europe with more than 70 percent of the new car build expected to include startstop by 2017 and
 the global startstop market for new vehicles reaching 35 million annually in that same timeframe according to recent consumer research
 commissioned by johnson controls 90 percent of startstop vehicle owners in europe say they are very satisfied and likely to purchase such a
 vehicle again

 startstop vehicles represent a major step forward in the mass commercialization of more energy efficient vehicles to support this growth
 johnson controls is investing 520 million globally to increase agm production capacity to support production programs in the us europe and
 china

the sheer volume and complexity of materials used makes it extremely difficult to report the total volume or weigth of materials used in our
manufacturing products however by far the largest amount of materials used by weight is battery lead
c2
by increasing our global recycling capabilities we aim to provide half of the lead we use each year from recycling this increase will come from both
developing new recycling facilities as well as expanding existing facilities in mexico we have constructed a new battery recycling facility to double
our recycling output in the country we opened a battery recycling facility in florence sc in the united states in 2012

johnson controls uses a variety of materials in manufacturing automotive interiors car batteries and hvac systems etc we identify our expectations
to suppliers as well as the substances that we do not purchase including restricted substances note list above and conflict minerals see above letter

it simply is not practical or of business value for a large diverse and global corporation to track and rollup such data the following is provided in
attempt to answer the question about material usage that in our opinion is far more relevant than what is being asked

automotive experience  produces interior systems for passenger cars and light trucks the significant materials purchased include

 aluminum and alloys
 steel including cold rolled steel tubing
 miscellaneous metals for component parts and fasteners
 upholstery goods such as plastic leather and cloth
 fiberglass
 abs plastic
 polypropylene
 vinyl including polyvinyl chloride
 copper and aluminum wiring
 rubberized hair and coconut fibers for seating
 bulk chemicals methanol diethanolamine xylene nhexane toluene phenol polyolds silicones catalysts and adhesives isocynates
methylenebisphenylisocyanate toluene disocyanate etc

power solutions  uses materials for automotive battery production that include
 lead from primary and secondary recycled metal smelters
 sulfuric acid
 plastic for battery casings

we continue to be the global leader in closedloop leadacid battery recycling we have helped make leadacid automotive batteries the most recycled
consumer product in the united states in north america 97 percent of leadacid batteries are recycled and 98 percent of the material in the batteries is
reused

developing new recycling facilities as well as expanding existing facilities in mexico we have constructed a new battery recycling facility to double
our recycling output in the country we opened a new battery recycling facility in south carolina in the united states in 2012

the implementation of our ecosteps program continues to increase recycling rates of automotive batteries in europe ecosteps is modeled after our
united states recycling program and enables consumers to take spent car batteries to any automotive retail location or mechanic to be recycled

we continue to support the chinese government in its effort to develop the countrys future battery recycling policies to ensure the proper and
responsible handling of lead


building efficiency makes electric and electronic products for airconditioning refrigeration heating and other equipment using materials that
include
 miscellaneous metals for component parts
 chlorofluorocarbions cfcs and hydrochloroflurocarbons hcfcs
 aluminum and copper wiring
 noncfc solvents


materials purchased by all three businesses to support administrative building maintenance and transportation related activities include
 noncfc solvents
 water
 noncfc solvents
 natural gas
 electricity
 liquefied natural gas forklift fuel
 gasoline and diesel fuel
 refrigerants
 cleaning products
 stationery and paper products
 computer equipment hardware and software
 office furniture
 electrical equipment printers fax machines photocopiers microwave ovens dishwashers
 foods and beverages

quantities of each material purchased are tracked mostly at the facility level proper material selection is critical to product quality and to protection of
the environment we commonly procure materials with the following guidelines in mind
 use non or less toxic material available
 increase the use of easytorecycle materials
 select recycled over virgin materials whenever possible
 reduce total consumption and minimize waste through employee training and process improvements
 purchase energyefficient energy star or eu labeled equipment whenever appropriate

in addition we created a design for sustainability team comprised of key design personnel from each business to investigate ways to generate less
waste and use less materials as well as energy and water in the manufacture of our products it also includes investigating the up and downstream
impact of our products eventually we hope to have data from all three businesses to allow us to monitor and report on our successes

considering the diversity of materials purchased to manufacture automotive interiors car batteries and hvac systems it is extremely difficult to
provide a reasonable estimate of the percentage of materials recycled however johnson controls is the leading manufacturer of automotive lead acid
batteries considering the relative weight of lead in comparison to other materials used and the high degree of recycled lead used in battery
manufacturing we estimate over 85 based on weight of materials used are recycled input materials

johnson controls recognized decades ago the environmental and business benefits of reducing waste for example the company continues to enhance
its reverse distribution collection infrastructure to promote battery recycling in the us market 99 of lead acid batteries are recycled and 95 of the
material in the batteries is reused johnson controls was instrumental in setting up the industrys closedloop battery recycling program johnson
controls has been an industry leader in using recycled lead with a focus on safety and sustainability in 2008 we launched our ecosteps battery
recycling program in europe today the recycling rate of battery lead is far higher than for any other recyclable commodity including newspapers
aluminum cans and plastic and glass bottles recognizing the benefits 48 states require leadacid batteries to be recycled through a takeback program
refinements in the process allow for plastic battery cases to be recycled along with any scrap lead from the production floors and lead particles
captured in environmental control equipment the materials are returned to manufacturers who use them in new batteries and other products such as
xray shielding innovations in battery design to facilitate disassembly continue along with development of highervoltage batteries to accommodate
the higher power demands of future vehicles and allow for new electronic steering braking and engine functions to improve fuel efficiency and reduce
emissions our automotive interiors business uses large amounts of recycled material in many applications within vehicle interiors areas that use
recycled material include acoustical applications absorbers headliners dampers barriers structural applications door panels package trays seats
trim air ducts door bolsters safety applications energy absorption countermeasures pillar trim door panels comfort applications seating pads trim
covers heatingventilatingair conditioning at the justintime manufacturing sites worldwide johnson controls reuses shipping containers wherever
possible this significantly reduces waste costs and landfill space requirements

in our automotive experience unit in europe a green team of johnson controls experts has developed elv goals that include recycling waste when
economical or using it as an energy source using recyclables to make interior components eliminating materials that contain heavy metals and
reducing emissions from car interior materials targeting zero the team also focuses on waste stream reduction and environmentallyfriendly product
design

in partnership with ford motor company johnson controls developed a seat cooling system that reduces fuel consumption by lowering overall vehicle
and air conditioner usage further johnson controls developed ecocor an advanced material made from recycled materials that can be used in
automotive interior components such as door panels in addition to its waste reductions benefits ecocor has the advantage of reduced weight which
contributes to fuel efficiency

punching waste from the instrument panel is first ground and the different fractions segregated the fiberreinforced plastic component is then used to
produce the air duct for the same vehicle this reprocessing reduces scrap waste by more than 200 tons per year we expect this process to have many
more applications

in another process we use woodfiber mats called fibrowood in producing the seat back panels of a luxury vehicle the punching waste that
accumulates in production of these parts is crushed mixed with polypropylene pellets and further processed as injectionmolded components these
materials are presently used for the fastening hooks of the seat back panel we also use recycled natural fiber materials to manufacture arm rests using

additional comments
 making our operations sustainable  johnson controls is committed to continuously improving the environmental impact of our own operations
this includes the performance of our facilities our procurement strategy and the use of commodities and resources

 johnson controls workplaces  we expect our office and manufacturing facilities to be energyefficient use less water and minimize waste our
energy focus includes improved energy efficiency use of renewable energy and the purchase of green power

we are using our own information technology including panoptix carbon  energy reporter to record track forecast and report energy use and
ghg emissions across our global operations

at our corporate and power solutions headquarters campus in milwaukee we are using our new gridlogix ennet and sustainability manager to
integrate solar energy generation subsystems with our metasys building management system to provide realtime monitoring metering and control

the implementation of our energy hunt program continues across participating manufacturing facilities globally this employee training and
continuous improvement program drives culture change towards more efficient energy use and waste elimination since its implementation in 2009
788 low or nocost projects resulted in energy and operational savings of over 196 million usd a further of approximately 900 projects are still in
progress or were implemented in 2012

 building a sustainable campus the johnson controls corporate and power solutions headquarters campus in milwaukee completed a 73 million
renovation and achieved the worlds first multibuilding leadership in energy and environmental design leed platinumcertified campus leed is
the green building council
rating system for sustainability platinum is its highest certification level the 33acre site is home to almost 900 employees and showcases the
energyefficient and sustainable building products and services that we provide to customers worldwide including roofmounted solar thermal panels
producing hot water for the majority of the campus  1452 groundmounted solar photovoltaic panels generating up to 250 kilowatts of electricity and
reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 11 million pounds a year  geothermal heat pumps connected to 272 underground wells providing both heating
and cooling water supplyreducing winter heating and summer chiller operating costs by at least 20 percent  30000gallon cistern capturing
rainwater for use in restroom systems reducing water consumption by 77 percent  participation by women and minorityowned contractors and
suppliers at more than 20 percent  locally harvested and manufactured materials account for more than 25 percent of construction and renovation
materialsin the last year the site hosted thousands of visitors from around the world

an initiative at our holme factory located in denmark has made the switch from fossil fuel to wet biomass a renewable energy source the factory
which manufactures chillers and screw compressor units needed to replace its over 40yearold boilers because of their increasing age declining
performance and the high cost of heavy fuel oil the energy environment  solutions team in europe worked to design and implement a solution
based on a biomass boiler which is co2 neutral thanks to the use of biomass from local danish forests managed in a sustainable way the solution is
able to reduce the polluting emissions by twothirds compared to the previous boilers the overall investment of 13135402 dkk  danish krone over
25 million usd will yield a simple payback in approximately 35 years in addition the project will lead to a total yearly energy expenditure
reduction of 60 percent and a total co2 reduction of 1120 tonsyear

fifty percent renewable energy used by automotive plant in march 2009 our new automotive seating and door panel plant in west point georgia
started operations using 50 percent of its energy from renewable sources including hydro biomass solar and wind compared to traditional energy
these green energy sources will save the emission of nearly 7500 metric tons of carbon dioxide over the next six yearsthe equivalent of planting
nearly 200000 trees

our global corporate energy team has also started supporting our green power commitment by procuring enough renewable energy certificates
recs to cover the electricity consumption of various plants in the us for all three divisions this green power amounted to 129000 metric tons of
carbon dioxide per year being offset from the total carbon inventory

in response to increasing global demand for renewable energy johnson controls inc is expanding its business direction in the areas of solar biomass
wind waste to energy landfill gas to energy geothermal combined heat  power chp and other renewable sources and fuel cells as energy supply
options for customers

we expect demand from businesses and organizations for onsite renewable energy to escalate as fossil fuels increase in price and concern grows about
their economic and environmental impact we believe the real opportunity involves combining renewable technologies with innovative energy
efficiency strategies and aggressively working to develop renewable offerings to state local and federal government agencies school districts
hospitals and private industry

we firmly believe the marketplace is ready to commit to renewables the investment we are now making is timely and positions the company to take
advantage of the significant growth that the renewable energy industry is experiencing johnson controls already has implemented several renewable
projects for its own sites below is a sample of a few of the technologies that have been installed and a brief description of a sample project

 building a sustainable campus  the johnson controls corporate and power solutions headquarters campus in milwaukee has completed a 73
million renovation and achieved the worlds first multibuilding leadership in energy and environmental design leed platinumcertified campus
leed is the green building council rating system for sustainability platinum is its highest certification level the 33acre site is home to almost 900
employees and showcases the energyefficient and sustainable building products and services that we provide to customers worldwide including
roofmounted solar thermal panels producing hot water for the majority of the campus  1452 groundmounted solar photovoltaic panels generating up
to 250 kilowatts of electricity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 11 million pounds a year  geothermal heat pumps connected to 272
underground wells providing both heating and cooling water supplyreducing winter heating and summer chiller operating costs by at least 20 percent
 30000gallon cistern capturing rainwater for use in restroom systems reducing water consumption by 77 percent  participation by women and
minorityowned contractors and suppliers at more than 20 percent  locally harvested and manufactured materials account for more than 25 percent of
construction and renovation materials

 automotive experience hq in burscheid germany  another great example of onsite renewable energy generation is the recently completed
installation of a crystalline photovoltaic system at the european headquarters of johnson controls automotive experience in burscheid germany the
156000 square feet building houses more than 1700 employees and is home to product development industrial design consumer and market research
benchmarking prototyping and a wide range of testing facilities the existing 1000 square meter glass roof while beautiful needed to be refurbished
instead of simply replacing the glass structure with new glass johnson controls global workplace solutions installed photovoltaic modules integrated
in glass elements that will generate approximately 67000 kwh of power each year and save almost 40 tons of co2

 fifty percent renewable energy used by automotive plant  in march 2009 our new automotive seating and door panel plant in west point
georgia started operations using 50 percent of its energy from renewable sources including hydro biomass solar and wind compared to traditional
energy these green energy sources will save the emission of nearly 7500 metric tons of carbon dioxide over the next six yearsthe equivalent of
planting nearly 200000 trees

 automotive experience assenede belgium plant  another onsite renewable energy example at a johnson controls site is the solar pv project at
automotive experience plant in assenede belgium delivering 437 kwh per year

our global corporate energy team has also started supporting our green power commitment by procuring enough renewable energy certificates
recs to cover the electricity consumption of various plants in the us for all three divisions this green power amounted to 129000 metric tons of
carbon dioxide per year being offset from the total carbon inventory

further an initiative at our holme factory located in denmark has made the switch from fossil fuel to wet biomass a renewable energy source the
factory which manufactures chillers and screw compressor units needed to replace its over 40yearold boilers because of their increasing age
declining performance and the high cost of heavy fuel oil the energy environment  solutions team in europe worked to design and implement a
solution based on a biomass boiler which is co2 neutral thanks to the use of biomass from local danish forests managed in a sustainable way the
solution is able to reduce the polluting emissions by twothirds compared to the previous boilers the overall investment of 13135402 dkk  danish
krone over 25 million will yield a simple payback in approximately 35 years in addition the project will lead to a total yearly energy expenditure
reduction of 60 percent and a total co2 reduction of 1120 tonsyear

 systems the current pilot project is testing a 1 megawatt of power at plant bowen and
 there are plans to begin testing it on a multimegawatt system later in 2013 and into
 2014

 johnson controls products and services focus on helping our customers become more
 energy efficient and sustainable this is shown by the low carbon technology found in
 current johnson controls offerings johnson controls introduced a solar cooling solution
 to reduce energy costs for large buildings across north america by combining its
 highefficiency chillers with hybrid solar thermal and photovoltaic pv technologies
 the solution uses the york absorption chiller and features pv wasteheat recovery
 technology converting 75 percent of the suns rays into energy compared to 15 percent
 efficiency in a traditional pv system the solution qualifies for state and utility
 incentives across north america especially in warm climates where cooling demand
 places a significant stress on the power grid driving up electricity rates the
 solarcooling solution integrates into any building controls system including the
 metasys building management system it generates hot water for the absorption chiller
 to air condition buildings and electricity to reduce demand from the power grid

 johnson controls goal is to help its customers be more sustainable and help them have a
 more comfortable and sustainable world in order to deliver this innovation has always
 been key when developing product offerings and continuously improving our internal
 processes and operations below some examples of how johnson controls delivers
 innovation through its products services and internal continuous improvement projects

 and benefits of a more comprehensive proactive dr offering increase by taking a more
 allinclusive approach to energy markets leveraging realtime metered data technologies
 and providing specific operational parameters embedded in gridconnect johnson
 controls generates significantly higher revenue for clients and continues to grow its
 business
 increasing energy efficiency financing represents one of the largest opportunities for the
 us to expand economic growth and create jobs for building owners energy efficiency
 lowers operating costs increases occupancy enhances building value and increases
 financial returns property assessed clean energy pace financing provides longterm
 upfront financing for energy efficiency projects pace financing helps overcome
 common project barriers such as insufficient credit and split incentives where tenants pay
 the utility bills and buildings owners might not see immediate incentives for major
 energy investments in 2010 san francisco established its pace district and was one of
 the first us cities to launch an open market pace program making 100 million in
 bonding capacity available to the citys commercial property owners johnson controls is
 in the process of designing and implementing the first energy efficiency upgrade funded
 through the citys pace financing an energy efficiency upgrade at the port of san
 franciscos historic property at pier 1 the corporate headquarters of prologis inc the
 project cost is approximately 16 million of which 90 percent is being funded by pace
 bonds the 20year lowinterest bond was purchased by clean fund of san rafael
 calif a specialty pace finance provider and will be paid off through a special property
 tax assessment johnson controls expects the retrofit project to reduce annual energy

 costs by over 98000 and reduce purchased energy by 32 percent upgrades include
 retrofits for 1500 lighting fixtures a 200kilowatt rooftop solar array and improvements
 to the buildings heating ventilation and air conditioning systems during its construction
 phase the project is expected to create nearly 30 local jobs and 37 million in additional
 economic development in california based on multipliers developed by the us
 department of commerce

 johnson controls holds sustainability as one of its core values helping our customers
 become more sustainable and making our own facilities and operations more sustainable
 as well in 2012 there were two great examples that help demonstrate johnson controls
 commitment to environmental stewardship the first project shows our commitment to
 our customers through one of the largest energy saving performance contracts and the
 other project shows our internal progress in making our own sites more efficient one
 year after johnson controls completed an innovative building retrofit project the empire
 state building was ahead of plan and has exceeded its year one energyefficiency
 guarantee by five percent saving 24 million and establishing a commercial real estate
 model for reducing costs maximizing return on investment increasing real estate value
 and protecting the environment the core energy efficiency retrofit at the empire state
 building is complete with the balance of the project to be finished as new tenants build
 out highperformance workspaces not only is the empire state building more energy
 efficient but it is also estimated to have saved 4000 metric tons of carbon the
 equivalent of the amount offset by 750 acres of pine forests the building will save 44
 million a year a 38 percent reduction of energy use that will cut carbon emissions by
 105000 metric tons over the next 15 years to develop this project johnson controls
 helped the owner assemble a coalition of leading organizations focused on energy
 efficiency and sustainability the team was comprised of the empire state building
 company llc johnson controls inc jones lang lasalle and rocky mountain
 institute the retrofit project focused on eight innovative improvement measures
 addressing core building infrastructure common spaces and tenant suites improvement
 measures performed by johnson controls and jones lang lasalle included the
 refurbishment of all 6500 windows a chiller plant retrofit new building controls and a
 webbased tenant energy management system the project partners developed a detailed
 engineering design and johnson controls guaranteed the energy savings through a 20
 million performance contract with performance contracting savings in energy
 consumption from facility upgrades pay for the project over the term of the contract if
 the savings are not realized johnson controls pays the difference between the value of
 the measured and verified consumption and the guaranteed consumption under the

impact on the outdoor environment is minimized we align facilities with core business objectives and evaluate using a wide array of systems
equipment and processes in order to identify energy and operational efficiency opportunities that will improve overall facility performance we begin
by addressing the two most common root causes of excessive costs 1 aging inefficient or misapplied building technologies and 2 undefined or
poorly aligned service levels typical improvements include enhancements to heating ventilating and airconditioning systems lighting and electrical
systems control systems motors and pumps and eliminating leaks and waste for example most fan systems are oversized by 60 while chillers are
often 50200 oversized features of the program include investmentgrade audits of resource consuming systems benchmarking of a facilities

initiatives to reduce indirect energy consumption and reductions achieved

 existing initiatives to reduce indirect energy use
 our overall strategy is to promote energy efficiency as the smart approach for reducing ghg
 emissions this strategy includes developing new tools to credibly track ghg emissions and
 offeringdeveloping cost effective products and services to reduce energy consumption and ghg
 emissions our strategy applies to our internal activities and those of our customers for example
 we continue to conduct energy star audits we are generally ranked high compared to all
 buildings nationwide even more impressive eight of the 24 offices qualified for the prestigious
 energy star label

 in addition johnson controls joined the us environmental protection agency epas climate
 leaders program in 2003 even when this program is no longer in place this organization helped
 us better understand risks from ghg emissions emitted from our operations and identify
 costeffective reduction opportunities

 this voluntary reporting program helped us commit to
 1 develop a corporatewide ghg inventory of the 6 major greenhouse gases and report progress
 annually based on global ghg protocols and guidance
 2 develop a corporate ghg inventory management plan in order to institutionalize the inventory
 process and
 3 establish an aggressive corporatewide ghg emissions reduction goal for our global operations

 johnson controls has pledged to reduce its global ghg emissions by 30 percent per million dollar
 in revenue from 2008 to 2018 this goal builds on our previous global goal that followed the same
 30 intensity reduction from 2002 to 2012 and that was achieved in 2008 year which became the
 companys new baseline we have also added an absolute ghg reduction goal of 1 percent per
 year and achieved a 35 percent absolute reduction in 2012 along with the new ghg goal jci has
 established metrics and goals around energy water waste environmental management and
 sustainable product design see our environmental scorecard in our supporting references

 from 2002 to 2010 our energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions data within the united states
 were independently reviewed by wsp group a subcontractor hired by epa climate leaders
 lessons learned from the audits were applied to our inventory management plan that was used to
 calculate our global energy use and ghg emissions starting with our 2011 data bureau veritas
 an independent auditor recognized by the carbon disclosure project audited our ghg emissions
 data per iso standard 140643 greenhouse gases  part 3 specification with guidance for the
 validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions they also audited our water data the
 objective of the audits is to provide further confidence that our reported energy ghg emissions
 and water data has a low margin of error the certificates for these most recent audits are attached
 note at this writing the certificates have yet to be received from the auditor but will be posted
 when received

 in addition our power solutions group has implemented powerframe battery manufacturing
 technology which is dramatically reducing ghg emissions by eliminating inefficient machines
 and thus using significantly less fuel

internally
johnson controls is committed to continuously improving the environmental impact of our own operations this includes the performance of our
facilities our procurement strategy and the use of commodities and resources we expect our office and manufacturing facilities to be energyefficient
use less water and minimize waste our energy focus includes improved energy efficiency use of renewable energy and the purchase of green power

we are using our own information technology including the energy and emissions management system to record track forecast and report energy
use and ghg emissions across our global operations at our corporate and power solutions headquarters campus in milwaukee we are using our new
gridlogix ennet and sustainability manager to integrate solar energy generation subsystems with our metasys building management system to
provide realtime monitoring metering and control

the implementation of our energy hunt program continues across participating manufacturing facilities globally this employee training and
continuous improvement program drives culture change towards more efficient energy use and waste elimination since its implementation in 2009
788 low or nocost projects resulted in energy and operational savings of over 196 million usd a further of approximately 900 projects are still in
progress or were implemented in 2012

introducing proven technologies and process improvements that lower energy operating and capital costs also help improve indoor environments and
ensure that the impact these facilities have on the outdoor environment is minimized we align facilities with core business objectives and evaluates
them using a wide array of systems equipment and processes to identify energy and operational efficiency opportunities that will improve overall
facility performance
the company begins by addressing the two most common root causes of excessive costs
 aging inefficient or misapplied building technologies and
 undefined or poorly aligned service levels
typical improvements include enhancements to heating ventilating and airconditioning systems lighting and electrical systems control systems
motors and pumps and eliminating leaks and waste features of the program include investmentgrade audits of resource consuming systems

benchmarking of a facilities energy usage and equipment efficiency identifying solutions based on best practices and various key performance
indicators to prioritize specific energy and costsaving projects installing equipment and processes needed to meet the overall business objectives

the johnson controls building efficiency headquarters  the brengel technology center  was one of the first leedcertified green buildings in the
world and was the first to be recertified under the leed for existing buildings rating the companys corporate headquarters in glendale wisc is
has a leed platinum certification  the highest designation available

in addition we have an active design for sustainability dfs actively looking to find ways of reducing energy use during the manufacturing process
the team has already implemented new processes to review designs as relates to sustainability for all new products

externally
supply chain  our global purchasing council gpc focuses on promoting sustainability within the supply chain we work with more than 300000
direct and indirect suppliers throughout the
world and expect them to conduct their operations in a socially and environmentally sustainable manner a few years ago the gpc developed
environmental requirements that state all suppliers must comply with applicable laws and regulations as well as our social and environmental
standards we use a variety of tools to assess suppliers including background checks selfassessment surveys site visits and audits we have an
enterprisewide supply chain standard that provides guidance to our procurement teams on the environmental and social performance of suppliers this
includes details on labor discrimination freedom of association health and safety the environment management systems and ethics the standard was
developed in partnership with key customers socially responsible investment funds and nongovernment organizations
johnson controls is a member of the carbon disclosure projects corporate supply chain program which is comprised of more than 31 multinational
companies dedicated to managing and reducing ghg emissions within their supply chain over the last year we have increased our requests to
suppliers to report their ghg emissions and reduction strategies

significant uses are for cooling and cleaning power solutions uses about one gallon of water mixed with acid for each battery manufactured

efforts to collect water use data were initiated globally in 2003 each year the number of facilities reporting increases and will continue to improve so
that we may trend usage for future reports water conservation efforts are primarily managed at the facility level but more focus on water use is
increasing as data becomes more available

our publicly stated goal for water reduction water  reduce energy consumption by 10 per dollar revenue from 2008 to 2018 see our business 
sustainability report for our sustinability scorecard with these environmental goals

starting with our 2011 data bureau veritas an independent auditor recognized by the carbon disclosure project audited our water consumption the
objective of the audits is to provide further confidence that our reported energy ghg emissions and water data have a low margin of error the
certificate for this most recent audits is attached as a verfication statement in supporting references

note case studies above that describes but a few of our efforts to reduce water use by our customers

facility siting and facility acquisitions undergo a due diligence process that to date has helped avoid situations where water usage would pose a
significant impact to the environment in addition our overall processes use a relative small quantity of water and practices are continuously being
applied to minimize usage

nevertheless johnson controls continues to offer services to promote water conservation through awareness technologies and monitoring as noted on
our web site johnson controls helps water providers and consumers reduce water usage increase efficiency of the systems that distribute and use
water and create healthy sustainable and green environments we do this with a creative funding tool that allows customers to take on the costly
projects immediately

york test lab water savings sustainability project  to support the jci sustainability goals the york test lab established a team to identify quantify
and assign value for possible water savings opportunities based on total cost and timetoimplement identified best short term opportunity in yorks
building 50 water cooled chiller lab where we test our highest capacity chillers as the lab is presently configured testing these chillers requires
significant amounts of water draining directly to the sites industrial waste stream
actions implemented  design a portable transfer pump cart and install required facility piping to
 reclaim water from chillers after testing is complete
 recover water form facility piping prior to cleaning of pump strainers during routine preventative maintenance
 use facility water in lieu of city water to provide cooling for water cooled motors and oil coolers
as a result of this project alone we are currently saving an estimated 456600 gallons per year

 biodiversity
 for the most part our facilities services and products have relatively little direct impact on critical
 habitats however we recognize biodiversification benefits all species including mankind by
 contributing to oxygen generation carbon sequestration soil stabilization and creating habitats for a
 variety of animals and plants through our blue sky involve program johnson controls encourages
 its employees to participate in community efforts including those promoting biodiversity for
 example johnson controls and bbc recently partnered with the woodland trust to plant native
 trees and hedges at the ochils in scotland where today like the rest of scotland less than 1 of the
 original forests survive beginning over 2000 years ago trees were cut for fuel and timber and to
 convert the land to agriculture as well as deliberately burned to eradicate vermin such as the wolf
 over the centuries the forest shrank as the human population grew and to satisfy the needs of
 industry particularly after exhausting the timber supply in england the widespread introduction of
 sheep and a large increase in the numbers of red deer ensured that once the forest was cleared it did
 not return

 the woodland trust has been conserving woodland for more than 30 years and is now recognized
 as the leading voluntarysector organization devoted to the conservation of the uks woodland the
 woodland trust has been granted the 50k award by biffa award and the 17500 trees are currently
 being planted at the ochils in scotland johnson controls is a proud supporter of the woodland
 trust and is most proud of its employees who help support the organization and its efforts in
 scotland

  nonsignificant on biodiversity in protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside proctected areas

  johnson controls is committed to responsible land use that promotes biodiversity and nature conservation when we acquire businesses that own
  sites with existing environmental issues we are aggressive in restoring them to productive uses our efforts always comply with regulatory
  requirements our land acquisitions are rather rare but when such acquisitions are proposed our environmental and legal experts evaluate the

johnson controls jci has pledged to reduce its global ghg emissions by 30 percent per million dollar in revenue from 2008 to 2018 this new goal
builds on our previous global goal that followed the same 30 intensity reduction from 2002 to 2012 and that was achieved in 2008 year which
became the companys new baseline we have also added an absolute ghg reduction goal of 1 percent per year and achieved a 35 percent absolute
reduction in 2012

in 2008 we emitted 64 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per million us dollars revenue our 2018 goal is to reduce ghg intensity by 30
percent and we have achieved a 130 percent reduction through the end of 2012 along with the new ghg goal jci has established metrics and goals
around energy water waste environmental management and sustainable product design

we continue to encourage telephone and video conferencing to reduce travel we have videoconferencing facilities throughout the world that are used
by our employees further we anticipate that our travelrelated emissions will decrease as commercial airlines and car rental agencies adopt more
efficient aircraft and vehicles johnson controls is studying ways to acquire reliable data and to reduce emissions related to employee commuting
supplier emissions waste disposal and services such as shipping courier delivery printing and other outsourced services at present it remains a
challenge to acquire accurate data for such emissions because most are beyond our control

            for the new buildings the kitchen and
            the fitness center the solar thermal
            system is expected to save
            approximately 2837 therms
            approximately 2500 per year of
            natural gas the domestic water system
            plumbing fixtures are all low flow the
            urinals are water free and the water
            closets are dual flush to reduce water
            consumption the campus also has a
            rainwater recovery system that collects
            rainwater from roof drains from
            approximately 50 of the campus roof
            area subsurface foundation drainage
            and from clear water waste such as
            cooling coil condensate into an
            exterior below grade cistern the
            water is treated through charcoal filters
            and uv lights and can be reused for
            water closet flushing to further reduce
            water consumption similarly multiple
            rain gardens are located throughout the
            site to recharge the ground water
            system and minimize the amount of
            storm water runoff discharged to the
            sewer system overall water reuse on
            campus is approximately 600000
            gallons 2271246 l while low flow
            fixtures have reduced water use by 11
            million gallons 41 639 510 l for a
            total reduction of 17 million gallons
            64 351 970 l of water annually a

            above the geothermal field and a
            second pv array was provided on the
            roof of building 3 to reduce the energy

            approximately 33000 per year of
            renewable energy for the remainder
            of the power required that is not
            generated on site the campus
            purchases renewable energy credits
            from a local utility each month
            according to the cleaner and greener
            emission reductions calculator
            thousands of pounds of harmful
            emissions can be avoided in the
            milwaukee and wisconsin areas the
            use of the solar pv system will offset
            375 tons of greenhouse gases co2
            1891 pounds of nox 4437 pounds of
            so2 and 7888 mg of mercury per

            reduction of energy use that will cut
            carbon emissions by 105000 metric
            tons over the next 15 years
            to develop this project johnson
            controls helped the owner assemble a
            coalition of leading organizations
            focused on energy efficiency and
            sustainability the team was comprised
            of the empire state building
            company llc johnson controls
            inc jones lang lasalle and rocky
            mountain institute

            innovative improvement measures
            addressing core building infrastructure
            common spaces and tenant suites
            improvement measures performed by
            johnson controls and jones lang
            lasalle included the refurbishment of

            retrofit new building controls and a
            webbased tenant energy management
            system the project partners developed
            a detailed engineering design and
            johnson controls guaranteed the
            energy savings through a 20 million
            performance contract with
            performance contracting savings in
            energy consumption from facility
            upgrades pay for the project over the
            term of the contract if the savings are
            not realized johnson controls pays the
            difference between the value of the
            measured and verified consumption
            and the guaranteed consumption under
            the contract
            a great example of johnson controls
            becoming internally more sustainable
            is the leed certification of our new
            manufacturing facility in riverside
            missouri this manufacturing facility
            earned leed silver certification from
            the green building certification
            institute the facility incorporates
            highperformance lighting and hvac
            units to slash energy use by 2448
            percent more than a third of materials
            used in the building are recycled this
            year our automotive experience
            headquarters in plymouth michigan
            became the first automotive
            experience administrative building to
            achieve leed certification although
            the 300000squarefoot facility was
            built years before leed standards
            existed we found ways to improve

ghg emissions across our global operations at our corporate and power solutions headquarters campus in milwaukee we are using our new
gridlogix ennet and sustainability manager to integrate solar energy generation subsystems with our metasys building management system to
provide realtime monitoring metering and control

our energy hunt program is being implemented across participating manufacturing facilities this employee training and continuous improvement
program drives culture change towards more efficient energy use and waste elimination

as a leading supplier of battery systems for hybrid electric vehicles johnson controls is committed to designing and delivering increasingly
sustainable products services and solutions that will help its customers improve their energy efficiency reduce their carbon footprint and achieve their
environmental goals leading by example johnson controls has implemented several greenhouse gas reduction strategies in its global fleet of 19000
vehicles it first introduced hybrid electric vehicles into its fleet in 2009 today it operates more than 500 hybrids each reducing greenhouse gas
ghg emissions by 30 and together saving 500000 in fuel costs during the first twoandahalf years of operation in 2011 it deployed 20
allelectric vans which are estimated to achieve a 61 ghg reduction per vehicle in 2012 johnson controls started using telematics  a system that
allows to better collect and share geographic and other data with driversand continue with the deployment of additional alternative fuel vehicles
johnson controls joined the national clean fleets partnership through the us dept of energy in february 2012 and to date has achieved 24 million
usd in fuel savings and reduced 6000 metric tons co2 by implementing more efficient and alternative units

  dramatic company
  growth has resulted in
  more facilities as well as
  amount and types of
  manufactured products
  etc when normalized to
  sales our overall ods
  emissions are relatively
  insignificant and change
  just slightly each year
c3
most annex 1 group 1 odcs are present in seal systems such as purchased refrigerators water coolers etc these products are sent for proper
recycling at the endoflife and refrigerants contained would be completely recycled the amount of emissions shown would be extremely low
amounts associated with the leakage associated with normal use
c4
halon is present is some of our fire suppression systems and is usually only emitted to suppress a fire or due to an accidental release which rarely
occurs overall our halon emissions are very small
c5
to the best of our knowledge annex b group 1 odss are absent from all of our products and all know equipment owned by johnson controls
c6
carbon tetrachloride is a prohibited chemical within johnson controls which means it cannot be used or purchased
c7
this chemical was eliminated from use in 2000
c9
this chemical is not purchased or used by johnson controls
c10
this chemical is not purchased or used by johnson controls
c11
these fugtive emissions are derived from the use of r22 only
c12
data includes refrigerant losses from our hvac manufacturing facilities york revisions for historic estimated data were made and values were
updated

sewage and stormwater represent the major types of discharges from our manufacturing plants and office complexes

wastewater from power solutions facilities is treated and tested before discharged discharge results are monitored and reported in accordance with
applicable permit requirements we reuse and recycle water whenever possible our battery plants have several recycle systems in place such as 1
closed loop acid recycle system  acid is reused to achieve the desired acid concentration and 2 pasting recycle systems where acid and oxide form
paste within a closed loop system that minimized releases into the wastewater treatment system also battery wash water is contained and recycled
back to acid mixing except where detergents are used that involves treatment before discharge

due to a change in waste categorization from nonhazardous to hazardous by the government in mexico waste streams from our sites in that country
were affected causing a shift of waste volume from the nonhazardous landfilled to the hazardous landfilled category this fy2011 reporting year
will be the transition year we anticipate observing a consistent trend for upcoming years
c30
total amount of waste generated from 2010 to 2011 increased by 21 intensity data indicates a 2 increase which is primarily the result of an

johnson controls recognized decades ago the environmental and business benefits of reducing wastes for example the company continues to enhance
its reverse distribution collection infrastructure to promote battery recycling today the recycling rate of battery lead is far higher than for any other
recyclable commodity including newspapers aluminum cans and plastic and glass bottles in the us market 99 of lead acid batteries are recycled
and 95 of the material in the batteries is reused johnson controls was instrumental in setting up the industrys closedloop battery recycling program
johnson controls has been an industry leader in using recycled lead with a focus on safety and sustainability recognizing the benefits 48 states
require leadacid batteries to be recycled through a takeback program refinements in the process allow for plastic battery cases to be recycled along
with any scrap lead from the production floors and lead particles captured in environmental control equipment the materials are returned to
manufacturers who use them in new batteries and other products such as xray shielding innovations in battery design to facilitate disassembly
continue along with development of highervoltage batteries to accommodate the higher power demands of future vehicles and allow for new
electronic steering braking and engine functions to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions in 2008 we launched our ecosteps battery recycling
program in europe our automotive interiors business uses large amounts of recycled material in many applications within vehicle interiors areas that
use recycled material include acoustical applications absorbers headliners dampers barriers structural applications door panels package trays
seats trim air ducts door bolsters safety applications energy absorption countermeasures pillar trim door panels comfort applications seating
pads trim covers heatingventilatingair conditioning at the justintime manufacturing sites worldwide johnson controls reuses shipping containers
wherever possible this significantly reduces waste costs and landfill space requirements in johnson controlsowned buildings as well as hundreds
of its customer sites old fluorescent light bulbs are sent to certified processors for metal recovery and recycling johnson controls also uses only
lowmercury bulb and electronic solid state switches instead of mercury relays in most applications

as part of johnson controls waste reduction efforts byproducts are analyzed for possible recycling or for sale as raw materials we sell scrap tinted
plastic to manufacturers for recycling into building products sell fabrics and thermoplastics back to manufacturers for reblending and recovery sell
plastic regrind on the open market or donate it to local universities for plastics engineering programs and recover used oils for recycling

 johnson controls performs no activities that would directly and significantly affect wetland ecosystems including the ramsarlisted wetlands we
 support ramsars aim which is the the conservation and wise use of all wetlands through local regional and national actions and international
 cooperation as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development throughout the world ramsar cop8 2002

 wastewater from power solutions facilities is treated and tested before discharged discharge results are monitored and reported in accordance
 with applicable permit requirements we reuse and recycle water whenever possible our battery plants have several recycle systems in place such
 as 1 closed loop acid recycle system  acid is reused to achieve the desired acid concentration and 2 pasting recycle systems where acid and
 oxide form paste within a closed loop system that minimized releases into the wastewater treatment system also battery wash water is contained
 and recycled back to acid mixing except where detergents are used that involves treatment before discharge

 because our production processes use little water opportunities for water recycling are limited most of are water is used for sanitation and is
 discharged to publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities which typically treat it and recycle it to the environment

 we are working with several customers to improve water quality and reduce costs associated with water use our recent focus has been on
 reducing inflowinfiltration ii to sanitary sewage piping systems either through remediation or insitu replacement this coincides with us
 environmental protection agencys enforcement actions against combined sewer overflows cso which can be caused in part by clear water
 entering sewer systems we are working directly with consoer townsend envirodyne a division of aecom which helped the city of nashville
 tennessee usa to reduce its annual ii by nearly 50 percent through remediation of 77 miles of the citys manifold system these reduced
 liquids received at the treatment plant by more than 32 billion gallons annually at a treatment cost saving of 158thousand gallons this enabled
 the local jurisdiction to remove 33 miles of the cumberland river from the epas list of polluted streams we are promoting this same type of
 analysis and effort in other municipalities including rock hill south carolina usa

initiatives to mitigate environmental impacts of products and services and extent of impact mitigation

 as one of the worlds largest consumer of lead for our lead acid batteries we make sure we are mitigating the impact of using lead as a raw
 material we do this through lead recycling automotive batteries are one of the most highly recycled products used by consumers in the us
 market 99 of lead acid batteries are recycled and 95 of the material in the batteries is reused johnson controls was instrumental in setting up
 the industrys closedloop battery recycling program johnson controls has been an industry leader in using recycled lead with a focus on safety
 and sustainability

 in the united states closed loop battery recycling is well established heres how it works a johnson controls truck leaves one of our battery
 manufacturing plants with a load of new batteries when those batteries are dropped off at a customer site the truck picks up the old spent
 batteries those batteries are delivered to a smelter where the plastic cases are ground down for later reuse in new battery cases the lead plates
 are removed and melted down into ingots the truck leaves the smelter with a load of recycled lead and delivers it back to our battery plant where
 the lead is turned into a key component of a new battery while the process is somewhat different in europe the result is much the same reuse of
 the major battery components again and again asias auto battery industry is quickly developing as more and more autos are produced currently
 there is a fragmented infrastructure for the recycling of the increasing number of used batteries in 2007 johnson controls led a delegation of
 chinese officials on a twoweek tour of battery recycling and production sites in europe and north america to help educate them on the cost
 saving and environmental benefits of these proven recycling processes in 2008 we launched our ecosteps battery recycling program in europe

 johnson controls develops automotive interior components that make cars more fuel efficient and easier to recycle at the end of their useful lives
 these include lightweight seats and components that help fuel consumption while meeting the requirements of the us national highway
 transportation safety act our automotive group uses a product safety signoff process in product development to review progress in meeting
 regulatory customer and due care requirements through the start of production after launch of a new product a systematic review is performed
 to identify and resolve quality issues that may have safety and environmental implications in our european operations a green team focuses
 on waste stream reduction and environmentallyfriendly design as part of our waste reduction efforts we analyze for possible recycling or for
 sale as raw materials the design guidelines outlined by the green team include selection of the optimal material for recyclability weight and
 emissions reduction of multiplicity of materials compatibility of materials no hazardous materials and design optimal for disassembly for end of
 life vehicle recycling

 the compliance xsight database was used to collect and analyze data from hundreds of suppliers these analyses helped ensure that we comply
 with our customers specifications and with government initiatives such as the endoflife directive in europe we recently replaced this system
 with the international material data system imds database to collect chemical content information from our suppliers for all parts data from
 the system are used to ensure that our parts conform to the global automotive declarable substances list gadsl see wwwgadslorg this list
 includes chemicals that have been banned or restricted for use on automotive parts voluntarily or through regulation including the eu end of
 life of vehicle regulation in any of the major global automotive markets refer to the gadsl web site for chemicals that are banned or
 restricted including the reason for restriction

 lifecycle management lifecycle management involves a complete examination of a products environmental and economic effects throughout
 its lifetime including new material extraction transportation manufacturing use recycling and disposal our commitment to lifecycle
 management of our products includes
  setting wasteintolandfill reduction goals
  developing recyclable postindustrial and postconsumer materials through relationships with manufacturers and material converters
  integrating recycled materials into our product lines
  helping our customers and suppliers recycle reclaim and integrate

 in 2009 we launched a global environmental sustainability council gesc to lead our efforts to reduce our environmental footprint gain
 competitive advantage through environmentally responsible products and services and improve the ecoefficiency of the supply chain
 the gesc includes executives from all three business units as well as representatives from legal public affairs and health safety and
 environment the focus of the gesc includes compliance metrics public affairs and design for sustainability dfs

 designforsustainability continues to gain momentum within our company our automotive experience business for example continues to
 develop and implement design processes that promote sustainable products we are testing an economic inputoutput life cycle assessment tool
 from carnegie mellon university to estimate embedded energy and carbon content within our products this tool and other
 designforsustainability resources and practices are being implemented to reduce energy use and carbon emissions in addition our technology
  advanced development group is exploring a portfolio of green materials we also are broadening our focus to include life cycle
 assessment lca protocols with an ultimate goal of developing processes that reduce the cost risk and environmental impact of our products

 we use industryleading sustainabilitylca software to develop custom internal models that can be used to estimate lifecycle emissions as well as
 other sustainability metrics for the products we design and produce

 the lca framework within the software follows guidelines per iso 14040  14044 the software is capable of addressing requirements of
 nearly all widely accepted procedures including ghg protocol pas 2050 and more

 we have been developing simpletouse spreadsheet based sustainability evaluation tools for all of our business groups automotive experience
 seating and ei power solutions and building efficiency the complex processes data collection and lca modelling behind the spreadsheet
 evaluation tools are supported by industryleading lcasustainability software industryacademia standard databases and actual measurements at
 our plants we use the software for detailed lca of the products as well when necessary

 the focus of our assessments at this time is to understand the relative difference of one product vs another we attempt to estimate and quantify
 improvements eg ghg emissions reduction by measuring and comparing sustainability metrics at various stages of product development as
 well as against the previous generation of the product

 our analysis would include all ghg sources in available datasets and as defined by cradle to gate and cradle to grave boundaries in lca
 we prepare and maintain detailed assumptions by each productcommodity when data is missing or when any significant sources of ghg are
 intentionally excluded from the analysis

 johnson controls is committed to continuously improving the environmental impact of our own operations this includes the performance of our
 facilities our procurement strategy and the use of commodities and resources
 we expect our office and manufacturing facilities to be energyefficient use less water and minimize waste our energy focus includes improved
 energy efficiency use of renewable energy and the purchase of green power

 we are using our own information technology including the energy and emissions management system to record track forecast and report
 energy use and ghg emissions across our global operations at our corporate and power solutions headquarters campus in milwaukee we are
 using our new gridlogix ennet and sustainability manager to integrate solar energy generation subsystems with our metasys building
 management system to provide realtime monitoring metering and control

 our new automotive seating and door panel plant in west point georgia started operations using 50 percent of its energy from renewable sources
 including hydro biomass solar and wind compared to traditional energy these green energy sources will save the emission of nearly 7500
 metric tons of carbon dioxide over the next six years

 our energy hunt program is being implemented across participating manufacturing facilities this employee training and continuous
 improvement program drives culture change towards more efficient energy use and waste elimination

 our global purchasing council gpc leads efforts to improve sustainability within our supply chain johnson controls works with more than
 300000 direct and indirect suppliers around the world and expects them to conduct their operations in a socially and environmentally sustainable
 manner we use a variety of tools to assess suppliers including background checks selfassessment surveys site visits and audits

 developed in partnership with key customers socially responsible investment funds and nongovernmental organizations our companywide
 supply chain standards provide guidance to our procurement teams on the environmental and social performance of suppliers this guidance
 includes details on labor discrimination freedom of association health and safety the environment management systems and ethics

 in 2012 we participated in the corporate supply chain program of the carbon disclosure project cdp for the fourth consecutive year the
 program is recognized as the leading initiative for assessing greenhouse gas emissions in supply chains our businesses invited more than 200
 suppliers to submit data which provides an understanding of the emissions associated with each supplier similarly we submitted data at the
 request of ten of our customers
 we continue to use the johnson controls supplier sustainability rating system a tool designed to promote sustainability in our supply chain and
 help us discover new opportunities in 2012 we recognized suppliers with the highest scores at an awards banquet

 we also recognize suppliers for reporting greenhouse gas ghg emissions to the cdp and for implementing various social and environmental
 initiatives
 some of the initiatives that we are pursuing to encourage greater supplier participation include
  broadening alternative waste disposal programs throughout our supply chain to reduce and
 redirect manufacturing waste recycling incineration etc
  enhancing recycled materials use in direct and indirect materials particularly paper resin and plastics
  continuing to purchase green energy while reducing costs through negotiated energy procurement
  participating in the us environmental protection agencys smartway program to further reduce logisticsrelated ghg emissions

in our automotive experience business we are championing environmentally conscious practices that reduce carbon emissions and use recycled or
recyclable materials we are focusing on reducing the weight of car seats which will deliver the greatest sustainability benefits by improving fuel
economy and on using natural materials and designs that are ecofriendly for example

fasertec  seat pads made out of renewable recyclable coconut fibers and latex create an ideal seating climate through their highly permeable and
moisture absorbing properties furthermore the slim yet highly stable material enables thin seat design for lower weight

ecobond headliner  is made up of 50 biomaterials by mass but still provides the strength and performance of traditional materials the headliner is
built with natural fibers such as hemp flax and knaf instead of fiberglass making for a lightweight durable product thats also made from sustainable
and recyclable materials

soy seat pads  are a combination of soybased foam and conventional polyurethane weve replaced 5 of the material in some car seats with this soy
product to reduce petroleumbased content

fibrit door panels  make use of wood fibers and wood chips these components feature substrates made from fibrit which is a mixture of
woodfiber pulp thermoplastic fiber and binding agents

apslc seat frames  are lightweight and inexpensive making them a good technology for global smallcar programs component weight reductions
enable improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency


in addition sustainable solutions are frequently shared with various stakeholders through presentations and reports through various professional
organizations and forums see supporting documents

automotive batteries are one of the most highly recycled products used by consumers in the us market 99 of lead acid batteries are recycled and
95 of the material in the batteries is reused johnson controls was instrumental in setting up the industrys closedloop battery recycling program
johnson controls has been an industry leader in using recycled lead with a focus on safety and sustainability

in the united states closed loop battery recycling is well established heres how it works a johnson controls truck leaves one of our battery
manufacturing plants with a load of new batteries when those batteries are dropped off at a customer site the truck picks up the old spent batteries
those batteries are delivered to a smelter where the plastic cases are ground down for later reuse in new battery cases the lead plates are removed and
melted down into ingots the truck leaves the smelter with a load of recycled lead and delivers it back to our battery plant where the lead is turned into
a key component of a new battery while the process is somewhat different in europe the result is much the same reuse of the major battery
components again and again asias auto battery industry is quickly developing as more and more autos are produced currently there is a fragmented
infrastructure for the recycling of the increasing number of used batteries in 2007 johnson controls led a delegation of chinese officials on a
twoweek tour of battery recycling and production sites in europe and north america to help educate them on the cost saving and environmental
benefits of these proven recycling processes in 2008 we launched our ecosteps battery recycling program in europe

in addition johnson controls continues to investigate practices that significantly reduce packaging from its suppliers or what we send to our customers
these investigations have ranged from being very formal such as a six sigma project to immediate application of simple ideas in many cases the
information is mostly available at the facility level and is not generally rollup

significant environmental impacts of transporting products and other goods and materials used for the
organizations operations and transporting members of the workforce

 report the significant environmental impacts of transportation used for logistical purposes and for transportation of members of the
 organizations workforce where quantitative data is not stated disclose the reason
 greenhouse gas emissions in carbon equivalent metric tonnes that related to employee travel via rental cars commercial travel and use of
 personal vehicles for company matters are reported in en17

 johnson controls monitors and reports its ghg emissions associated with corporate jet use scope 0ne and employee business travel scope
 three

 the distribution of our products is accomplished primarily through freight haulers mail services and leased vehicles ghg emissions data for
 operations controlled by others are often difficult to obtain and tends to be entwined with emissions unrelated to johnson controls alone until
 we are able to acquire meaningful data on distributionlogistics related emssions we will continue to seek transportation cost reductions that
 are closely linked to fuel consumption and ghg emissions

 additionally in 2012 the building efficiency division of johnson controls became a smartway certified shipper see attachments below
 smartway is an epa program designed to reduce transportation related emissions from the supply chain smartway partners commit to
 benchmark opertions track fuel comsumption and improve performance annually

 johnson controls was recongized see attachements below for its efforts in reducing ghg during the transport of products

 indicate the criteria and methodology used to determine which environmental impacts are significant
 methodologies for calculating our ghg emissions are based primarily on the ghg protocol provided by the world business council for
 sustainable development and world resources institute other factors provided by the epa and doe were used as well but are consistent
 with those established in the ghg protocol the overall process used to collect validate and estimate emissions are discussed in detail in our
 inventory management plan imp which has been reviewed by our internal experts and the epa we have also shared this plan with other
 corporations which are using it as the basis for their ghg emissions programs

 total expense related to logistics is categorized and tracked which is an indicator of ghg emissions the expense related to logistics
 movement is targeted for reduction by reducing total miles involved in product distribution and by increasing our logistics providers required
 minimum fleet mpg

 carbon nox and sox are commonly traded in various markets in lots involving at least one metric ton thus every attempt is being made to
 capture and report emissions to within one metric ton

 report how the environmental impacts of transporting products members of the organizations workforce and other goods and materials are
 mitigated
 johnson controls maintains contracts with hundreds of suppliers worldwide we currently dialogue with several nongovernmental
 organizations ngos to improve oversight of our suppliers social and environmental performance as a result we incorporated these
 requirements into our suppliers standard manual that is posted on our public web site
 httpwwwjohnsoncontrol
 the standard includes provisions consistent with the ten un global compact principles and key international labour organization ilo
 conventions and mandates regulatory compliance and promotes good social and environmental stewardship by our employees and suppliers
 as our supplier oversight program matures we intend to investigate how best to incorporate energy and ghg monitoring in the program that
 we expect will ultimately lead to more business opportunities

 we continue to encourage telephone and video conferencing to reduce travel we have videoconferencing facilities throughout the world that
 are used by our employees over the past year we have deployed 9 cisco telepresence video systems in the united states south america 
 emea to help improve collaboration and unify the organization a telepresence video system is a highend video conferencing system thats
 uses stateoftheart room designs video cameras displays soundsystems and interactive elements to create the feeling of being in person
 with participants in remote locations this simple easytouse solution allows employees and other participants to communicate naturally and
 effectively

 telepresence provides the following benefits

 corporate travel displacement
 increased meeting participation and engagement
 faster decision making
 enhanced productivity through improved information exchange

  carbon footprint reduction

  further we anticipate that our travelrelated emissions will decrease as commercial airlines and car rental agencies adopt more efficient
  aircraft and vehicles johnson controls also recently implemented a smart travel program that focuses on making the employee travel
  experience greener an example includes declining free upgrade offers by rental car agencies as larger vehicles also imply more fuel
  consumption and therefore larger impact in producing greenhouse gases we also initiated a survey of major hotel providers to ensure
  sustainable practices are in use which is used as part of our selection criteria in sourcing we are working with other major corporations to
  promote more green choices when our employees travel and have begun offering our products and services to those in the travel industry to
  allow them to be greener additionally we have instituted new approval processes that require approval by the vicepresident in the
  employees organizational hierarchy to ensure the travel our employees perform is necessary

this information is tracked at the facility level and often included in overall operational costs reporting johnson controls incs jci global

responsibilities in multiple management and worker positions and other variables jci however is committed to enhancing the collection of data
relating to environmental protection expenditures and investments jci believes this data and other data related to sustainability and environmental
protection is essential for the following purposes 1 benchmarking and assessing sustainability performance with respect to laws norms codes and
performance standards 2 demonstrating how jci influences and is influenced by expectations about sustainable development and 3 comparing
performance within jci and between different organizations over time

environmental health and safety matters
laws addressing the protection of the environment environmental laws and workers safety and health worker safety laws govern the companys
ongoing global operations they generally provide for civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance or
require remediation of sites where companyrelated materials have been released into the environment

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws


generated from onereport                                             164246                                          johnson controls inc

and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance certain of the companys businesses are or have been engaged in the handling or
use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment the company is committed to protecting its workers and the
environment against the risks associated with these substances

the companys operations and facilities have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or
proceedings for noncompliance with environmental laws and worker safety laws or for the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the
environment such matters typically are resolved by negotiation with regulatory authorities that result in commitments to compliance abatement or
remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties historically neither such commitments nor such penalties have been material

the companys ongoing environmental compliance program often results in capital expenditures environmental considerations are a part of all
significant capital expenditure decisions however expenditures in fiscal 2012 related solely to environmental compliance were not material

currently the company is responding to allegations that it is responsible for performing environmental remediation or for the repayment of costs spent
by governmental entities or others performing remediation at approximately 38 sites in the united states many of these sites are landfills used by the
company in the past for the disposal of waste materials others are secondary lead smelters and lead recycling sites where the company returned
leadcontaining materials for recycling a few involve the cleanup of company manufacturing facilities and the remaining fall into miscellaneous
categories the company may face similar claims of liability at additional sites in the future where potential liabilities are alleged the company
pursues a course of action intended to mitigate them

the company accrues for potential environmental liabilities in a manner consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states
that is when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable reserves for environmental liabilities
totaled 25 million and 30 million at september 30 2012 and 2011 respectively the company reviews the status of its environmental sites on a
quarterly basis and adjusts its reserves accordingly such potential liabilities accrued by the company do not take into consideration possible recoveries
of future insurance proceeds they do however take into account the likely share other parties will bear at remediation sites it is difficult to estimate
the companys ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved the complexity of
determining the relative liability among those parties the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted
the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in
corrective actions at the sites and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur nevertheless the company does not
currently believe that any claims penalties or costs in connection with known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the
companys financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition the company has identified asset retirement obligations for
environmental matters that are expected to be addressed at the retirement disposal removal or abandonment of existing owned facilities primarily in
the power solutions business at september 30 2012 and 2011 the company recorded conditional asset retirement obligations of 76 million and 91
million respectively

the company is involved in a number of product liability and various other casualty lawsuits incident to the operation of its businesses the company
maintains insurance coverages and records estimated costs for claims and suits of this nature it is managements opinion that none of these will have a
material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows costs related to such matters were not material to the
periods presented

 johnson controls health and safety programs are designed to provide a safe working environment our programs are behaviorbased health and
 safety programs that rely on a systems management approach to ensure compliance and continuous improvement while compliance with health
 and safety regulations is important and required our programs reach beyond compliance to influence our companys culture through employee
 engagement and leadership behavior given the diversity and decentralized nature of our company our health and safety programs are designed
 around a global standard with approved variations to address the multiple jurisdictions and regulations specific hazards and unique working
 environments of each business unit the way we operate and measure the performance and outcomes of our health and safety programs
 however is consistent with widely accepted standards and practices that meet or exceed the international labour organizations guidelines for
 occupational health management systems iloosh 2001 our goal is to achieve and maintain world class safety performance in all of our
 businesses and operations some of the key standards and practices of our programs include

 1 use of standard usosha definitions to measure injury and illness rates globally we believe that injury and illness rates based on consistent
 definitions is an objective measure of success we are committed to reducing them over the longterm

 2 use of widely acceptable standards for the most critical safety processes such as control of hazardous energy and working with hazardous
 substances such standards apply to all of our locations worldwide regardless of local regulatory requirements

 3 use of established management system techniques to assure that injury rate reductions are real and sustainable

 4 verifying the accuracy of selfreported safety and health data trust but verify we use thirdparty auditors to verify data and the overall
 effectiveness of health and safety programs

 5 exploring innovative ways to further strengthen our safety culture the companys increasing focus on leading indicators as a measure of
 safety performance and outcomes is an example of this innovation

 our behaviorbased programs take many shapes and forms many of the companys business units utilize safestart an advanced third party
 safety awareness training and skills development program safestart teaches individuals to recognize the critical error reduction techniques
 needed to reduce the risk of injuries in any situation  at work at home or on the road where safestart is not utilized the business units
 implement other behaviorbased safety programs for example the automotive experience ae business unit utilizes a total safety culture
 tsc management system to drive behavior based safety outcomes this systems approach is similar to the total quality culture management
 system found in the auto manufacturing industry at its core tsc is based on 5 interconnected elements including workplace conditions
 leadership in safety management systems behavior safety and employee involvement these 5 elements work in conjunction to address
 workplace behaviors while ensuring compliance

additional comments
in the united states we provided benefits to employees that amounted to 35 percent of salary a comparable figure for the rest of the world is not
available due to the variety of data systems and privacy laws that prevail in several of the countries in which we are located the company is committed
to paying a prevailing wage to employees in many parts of the world we have reduced employee turnover rates by paying more than what is paid to
employees at other local companies

our compensation and benefits plans are competitive within the markets we serve and reflect the performance of our business and our employees
employees receive at least the statutory minimum wage or the local prevailing industry wage whichever is higher they receive at a minimum the
legally mandated benefits except in extraordinary business circumstances employees work no more than 48 hours per week and 12 hours overtime or
hours established by local law whichever is less overtime compensation complies with applicable laws and where no laws exist employees are paid
at least their regular hourly compensation extraordinary circumstances would include emergencies and the like and is not indicative of a way to ignore
abiding by host country law since such language is included in most labor laws guidelines and conventions changing our ethics policy to include
such language does not appear warranted at this time since we are unaware of any issues related to the current language wages are not deducted for
disciplinary purposes we respect employees freedom of association including the right to bargain collectively under lawful procedures

we track benefits as legally mandated and strive to be competitive in all our markets and as a result often go beyond legal requirements here are some
examples

employees in mumbai india receive a free dental checkup by colgate palmolive qualified dentists give free consultation on how to protect against
tooth decay and maintain a healthy smile employees there also have access to a renowned dietician regarding healthy diet habits

in mexico where plants have an inhouse doctor employees and their families may avail themselves of basic primary care medical services salaried
employees are provided supplemental healthcare coverage allowing them access to quality care beyond that provided through social security in
addition many of our plants hold an annual health week for employees where employees receive different health tests in order to prevent illness as
well as medical information for employees and their families

in hanover germany we budget 40000 to 50000 euro annually to be used to support vacation for employees families with lower income and for
employees who are faced with financial hardship due to emergencies eg loss of spouse fire etc employees apply for the contribution at the local
works council office

our us employees receive a variety of benefits beyond those legally mandated including college tuitionreimbursement for employees and college
scholarships for employees children we also provide a companypaid pension plan as well as a 401k plan with a company match below is a table
outlining our tuition reimbursement amounts paid in fy 2012

tuition reimbursement for fy 2012
amount paid
fy12 nontaxable 326439282

benefits for parttime employees
starting in 2009 employees in the us who are parttime regular nonunion employees are eligible for johnson controls health  welfare benefits
based on number of hours worked per week these benefits include

injury rate entries include injuries illnesses and fatalaties seperate numbers for each are not avaialable lost day rate is the rate of lost day cases
most of the data for this question is reported with the exception of contractor data which is simply too complex to report ie different reporting
systems and reporting rules which are best monitored at the facility level rather than rolling up into a corporatewide number also to ensure
consistency globally for our internal safety statistics we elected to apply the epa recordkeeping rules to all facilities no matter where located in the
world in doing so we combined illnesses with injury for a total recordable rate which is explained in this section
c2
safety incident rates are tracked globally in accordance with the us osha recordkeeeping handbook the regulation and related interpretations
for recording and reporting occupational injuries and illnesses publication osha 324509r 2005 available at wwwoshagov illness and injury
rates are combined and reported as recordable andor lost time incident rates as defined by the recordkeeping criteria also total employees are based
on man hours worked which is a more accurate measure of employee totals particularly when calculating rates

global enterprisewide development strategy

high performance at johnson controls is an outcome of a persons ability to change adapt and grow throughout his or her career at johnson
controls the emphasis is on the value of reallife realtime learning that enables a person to meet the demands of challenging and changing work

the companys approach to learning focuses on reinforcing three key principles that are designed to support an individuals effectiveness in his or her
current job and in future situations throughout the world johnson controls employees are encouraged to develop behaviors and skills of leading
self behaviors required of all employees for excellent performance and to deliver our values leading people behaviors to engage motivate and
develop our employees and leading globally behaviors to deliver a global strategy

education and training provide core knowledge and skills but the best learning comes from reallife onthejob experience seek out best practices and
suggestions from people throughout the company and find ways to apply their knowledge and experience to your situation find ways to learn and to
achieve goals through volunteer activities participation in community activities and professional organizations or other offthejob experiences by
seeking a wide range of experiences challenges and lessons more opportunities are available to gain more knowledge new perspectives and greater
leadership skills

attitude often is the difference between an individual who just goes through the motions to meet the minimum expectations at work and an
individual who thrives on the job individuals are more likely to thrive when they actively look for challenging job assignments rather than waiting for
opportunities to emerge they can develop and grow within their existing positions as well as through new assignments but they need to take risks
look for new challenges and believe that tough situations are also learning opportunities

available through tools opportunities and systems supervisors managers and senior leaders are expected to view the development of others as a top
priority through realworld work johnson controls offers ample challenges candid feedback coaching mentors and role models

johnson controls also trains employees in environmental safety and health practices automotive experience for example provides environmental
training at all levels based on each employees responsibilities johnson controls has created a new global training tool that describes current principles

disclosure on management approach 
concise disclosure on the following management approach items with reference to the human rights
aspects listed below the ilo tripartite declaration concerning multinational enterprises and social
policy in particular the eight core conventions of the ilo which consist of conventions 100 111 87 98
138 182 20 and 1059 and the organisation for economic cooperation and development guidelines for
multinational enterprises should be the primary reference points

         investment and procurement practices
         nondiscrimination
         freedom of association and collective bargaining
         abolition of child labor
         prevention of forced and compulsory labor
         complaints and grievance practices
         security practices and
         indigenous rights


 our human rights  sustainability policy and our ethics policy define our overall management approach as relates to human rights
 anticorruption environmental governance social and related matters our human rights policy specifically states that we fully support the
 united nations global compacts ten principles which are based on the universal declaration of human rights the international labor
 organizations declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work the rio declaration on environment and development and the
 united nations convention against corruption in addition johnson controls supports the united nations framework on business and human
 rights

 leadership in human rights reporting  johnson controls publicly and fully reports to the un global compacts communication
 on progress companies reporting in this manner are recognized as leaders in sustainability reporting that includes human rights we also report
 in accordance with the global reporting initiative and post those reports on our public web site

 complaints and grievance practices 
 a 24hour integrity helpline is available to anyone who suspects unethical behavior at the company the hotline available 24 hours a day in all
 major languages is operated by an independent thirdparty vendor and allows callers to report matters anonymously calls are tracked for content
 and monitored for indication of higher incidents of volume if a particular region or business unit is trending in a problematic direction the
 company schedules special training classes for that particular region or business unit additionally the content of the calls helps to drive the
 selection of topics for the annual ethics training modules

 through the 24hour integrity helpline we identify concerns through callers the purpose of the call origin ie phone or email country
 business group the information is categorized by incidents ie harassment fraud discrimination these incidents are assigned to the
 appropriate group general counsel to ensure a factfinding and an appropriate resolution is implemented a followup occurs to review the
 assessment and execute proposed resolution our general counsel also analyzes the incidents for trends and implements improvement actions as
 appropriate analysis of the incidents provides input into the selection of the annual training modules in which employees participate
 additionally johnson controls inc compares its results against worldwide organizations that comprise the network this report is reviewed
 with the general counsel our board of directors hr professionals and eny our external auditors

 the 24hour integrity helpline is not the only channel that management relies on for reporting of incidents by employees rather it is one of only
 several communication vehicles that employees can use to report discrimination incidents most often employees discuss such issues directly with
 their supervisor this reflects the fact that most issues that come up every day are being handled at the local plant or office level with local
 managers and supervisors we consider the ethics hotline a last resort channel for employees as we know that most discrimination issues are
 dealt with between the employee and supervisor

 specifics for each topic noted above are discussed below

 occupational health  safety

 the johnson controls safety program is designed so that all employees are provided a safe environment to work our program is based on a
 systems management approach that ensures continuous improvement the way we operate and measure performance globally is consistent with
 widely accepted standards and practices that meet or exceed the ilo guidelines for occupational health management systems our goal is to
 achieve and maintain world class safety performance some of the key practices and challenges we face in achieving that goal are
 1 use of standard us osha definitions to measure injury and illness rates globally we believe using injury and illness rates based on
 consistent definitions are the most objective measure of success and reducing them is how a safety program provides value to employees and
 shareholders
 2 use of widely acceptable standards for the most critical safety processes such as control of hazardous energy and working with hazardous
 substances such standards apply to all of our locations worldwide regardless of local regulatory requirements these standards are applied
 through our corporate bos document
 3 use of established management system techniques to assure that injury rate reductions are real and sustainable we distribute a monthly safety
 report to all management in which rates are pulled from our chess system the report helps facilities understand how they are doing also
 every plant listed in the report is required to develop a formal action plan for improving safety and health the plan identifies specific goals ie
 improvements in injury and losttime case rates timetables and responsible persons the planning process is defined in a companywide safety
 management system document this helps all facilities clearly define targets consistent with company expectations ultimately driving continuous
 improvement included in the management system is a requirement for all facilities to follow standard safety and environmental management
 system practices as defined in our corporate processes which are based on the occupational safety and health assessment series 18001 an
 internationally recognized standard
 4 verifying the accuracy of selfreported safety and health data we use thirdparty auditors to verify data and the overall safety program the
 audit matches the requirements in the safety and health standard so that compliance with the standard is required to pass the audit a location that
 fails to pass the audit cannot earn a safety award any issues uncovered during an audit must be tracked and corrected by the locations in a timely
 manner audit data is used as a basis to create safety improvement action plans
 5 johnson controls has entered into a fiveyear licensing agreement with electrolab for use and duplication rights to safestart an
 advanced safety awareness training program this program is applicable to all johnson controls work environments because it teaches individuals
 to recognize and correct unintentional errors that can lead to injury whether at work home or on the road

3 clear accurate and appropriate reporting to johnson controls upon request

basic principles  johnson controls encourages improvement when appropriate however termination of a contract is considered when the vendor
fails to comply with the spirit and intent of our ethics policy has significant social and environmental performance issues that cannot be resolved in a
timely or cooperative manner or could result in significant repercussions for johnson controls or our customers

supplier selection criteria  in addition to cost and quality social and environmental performance is used to select and retain suppliers acceptance of
a purchase order means the supplier agrees to our purchasing standards no purchase orders will be awarded to suppliers that refuse to abide by the
ethics policy or equivalent within a reasonable amount of time or have significant environmental or social performance issues that cannot be resolved
in a timely manner

responsibilities  the senior manager for each business and location who procures materials and services is ultimately responsible for implementing
appropriate processes and systems to ensure their suppliers comply with the johnson controls ethics policy or equivalent policy procurement
personnel will oversee suppliers to ensure compliance personnel from other functional areas eg quality environmental and safety will support
procurement as requested to assess supplier compliance

ethics policy and guidance 
httpwwwjohnsoncontrol

our ethics policy provides overall guidance about our expectations to both suppliers and employees in addition a companywide standard is in place
that provides additional guidance to procurement and other personnel regarding the environmental and social performance of suppliers as further
specified below

labor  suppliers should treat workers with dignity and

1 prohibit the use of forced bonded indentured or involuntary prison labor allow workers to leave employment upon reasonable notice and not
require workers to hand over governmentissued identification passports or work permits as a condition of employment
2 employ workers who are at least 16 years old youth between 16 to 18 years should enjoy all the benefits of a nurturing workplace such as training
and development programs workers under the age of 18 should not perform hazardous work and may be restricted from night work with consideration
given to educational needs
3 set work hours to comply with local law limit a workweek to 60 hours or less including overtime except in emergency or unusual situations
4 comply with applicable wage laws including those relating to minimum wages overtime hours and legally mandated benefits employees receive at
least the minimum wage required by law or the prevailing industry wage whichever is higher workers receive full details regarding deductions for
taxes benefits etc wages are not deducted for disciplinary purposes and are paid in cash check form or by direct deposit
5 maintain workplaces free of physical or mental harassment abuse or any other behavior that diminishes a persons integrity and self esteem this
includes harsh and inhumane treatment including any sexual harassment sexual abuse corporal punishment mental or physical coercion verbal abuse
of workers
6 maintain workplaces free of unlawful discrimination and harassment in all of its forms including that related to color race gender sexual
preference age pregnancy caste disability union membership ethnicity and religious beliefs this applies to hiring salary benefits advancement
discipline termination and retirement
7 respect voluntary freedom of association including the right to organize and bargain collectively in a manner that is legally compliant workers
representatives are not subject to discrimination and have access to workplaces necessary to carry out their respective functions where worker
representation and collective bargaining are restricted by law efforts should be made to facilitate open communication and direct engagement between
workers and management as alternative ways of ensuring that workers rights needs and views are considered and acted upon appropriately and in
good faith

health and safety  suppliers practice the following
1 control worker exposure to potential safety hazards eg electrical and other energy sources fire heat vehicles and fall hazards through proper
design engineering and administrative controls preventive maintenance and safe work procedures including lockout tagout where hazards cannot
be adequately controlled by these means provide workers at no cost as appropriate the proper personal protective equipment and ensure proper
maintenance of the equipment workers are not disciplined for raising safety concerns
2 maintain appropriate emergency plans and response procedures including emergency reporting employee notification and evacuation procedures
worker training and drills appropriate fire detection and suppression equipment adequate exit facilities and recovery plans
3 manage track and report occupational injuries and illnesses including provisions to a encourage worker reporting b classify and record injury
and illness cases c provide necessary medical treatment d investigate and implement corrective actions to eliminate their causes and d facilitate
return of workers to work
4 identify evaluate and control worker exposure to chemical biological radiological and physical agents as well as physically demanding tasks
provide appropriate personal protective equipment when hazards cannot be otherwise controlled
5 provide and properly maintain machine safeguards interlocks and barriers
6 provide clean toilet facilities access to potable water and sanitary food preparation and storage facilities worker dormitories provided by the vendor
or a labor agent are to be clean safe and provide emergency egress adequate ventilation and reasonable personal space

environmental  adverse effects on the community environment and natural resources are to be minimized while safeguarding the health and
safety of the public as well as ensure the following
1 obtain keep current and follow required environmental permits eg discharge monitoring and registrations
2 implement programs to conserve water and energy and reduce waste
3 identify and manage the materials posing a hazard if released to the environment are to ensure safe handling movement storage recycling or reuse
and disposal
4 monitor treat and control air emissions wastewater and waste as required prior to discharge or disposal
5 adhere to applicable laws and contract requirements regarding prohibition or restriction of specific substances materials and waste

management system  suppliers adopt a management system compliant with iso 14001 or equivalent as approved by johnson controls

procurement department that promotes continuous improvement and compliance with applicable laws regulations and contract requirements

ethics  suppliers should uphold the highest ethical standards to include

1 prohibit corruption extortion and embezzlement bribery or other means of obtaining undue or improper advantage and to ensure fair business
advertising and competition
2 properly disclose and protect business information customer information and intellectual property rights in accordance with applicable requirements
and prevailing industry practices
3 protect supplier and employee whistleblower confidentiality

gathering information on supplier practices
each business group uses a variety of tools to assess its prospective and existing suppliers this often includes background checks self assessment
surveys site visits third party auditsdata internal discussions with personnel from other internal ie environmental safety human resources and
quality and external organizations ie industry peers regulatory agencies investment analysts internet news media and nongovernment
organizations as well as trade publications dunn  bradstreet reports and informal networks with other procurement groups and trade associations

protocols for assessing data reliability
generally johnson controls expects suppliers to behave ethically as well as maintain open and honest communications we believe this to be true with
nearly every supplier that we have under contract each business group has a common set of criteria supplier sustainability rating supplier scorecard
and supplier assessment survey for assessing the environmental and social performance of key suppliers especially those posing the greatest risks to
johnson controls and its customers ie raw material extraction chemical processing manufacturing associated with high labor demands etc we
also rely on local state and federal agencies to monitor a suppliers compliance with environmental and labor laws we often use the web or have
direct discussions with the regulatory agency to review a suppliers compliance record in addition we often perform site audits of selected suppliers to
ensure that the proper environmental and social processes are documented implemented and remain effective additional supplier oversight may also
be prompted by negative reports regarding the environmental and social conditions of a suppliers facility or process

common areas of noncompliance identified
however like any company we encounter issues that are dealt with promptly and appropriately falsification of data is taken seriously and appropriate
followup actions are taken whenever data is suspect that could result in contract termination

to date no significant social or environmental performance issues have been identified with any supplier however there have been instances in which
followup questions discussions etc have been necessary particularly relative to environmental permit currency and operations compliance

supplier surveys and audits
each business unit is implementing processes to track the following metrics

 percentage of total suppliers that refuse to abide by the johnson controls ethics policy or equivalent
 percentage of direct material suppliers identified for auditing
 percentage of direct material suppliers audited by johnson controls or third party
 number and type of suppliers terminated due to social and environmental performance issues
current data indicates that no supplier has refused to abide with the essence of the ethics policy or has been terminated due to social or environmental
performance issues there have been past instances where suppliers with good environmental andor social performance records were awarded
contracts over those with more questionable records specific data regarding audits will be reported in future reports as appropriate

procedures and timetable for addressing supplier compliance
in april 2006 the corporate standard that provides ethics policy guidance to procurement and other personnel regarding the environmental and social
performance of suppliers was implemented companywide each business has established common processes to ensure compliance with the standard
and appropriate additionsmodifications are being taken full implementation of the standard began in 2007 and continues as new suppliers are added
for some business units implementation includes modifications to the suppliers standard manual audit criteria processes for collecting and reporting
metrics and discussions with suppliers

in addition self audit questionnaires have and continue to be sent to key suppliers in each business the first round responses were reviewed and
opportunities for improvement discussed with key suppliers improvements include ensuring each supplier understands and complies with our human
rights environmental governance expectations and encouraging them to have systems in place to drive continuous improvement

the company recently launched a new supplier survey called the johnson controls sustainability supplier rating it was released in january of 2010
and is available on the johnson controls website in the supplier information section
httpwwwjohnsoncontrol
the online survey allows suppliers to complete the questionnaire at their convenience the questionnaire contains 17 questions related to human rights
working conditions employee safety and energy management the sustainability rating will be a method for measuring sustainability activity and
compliance with our supply base it will also be used as an input to the supplier scorecard it includes more specific questions regarding human rights
safety and the environment it also asks if the supplier is publicly reporting data such as its greenhouse gas emissions and specifically asks if the
supplier is reporting to the carbon disclosure project please see supporting references for supplier sustainability rating survey located on our web
site

safety awareness  training
the johnson controls safety program is designed so that all employees are provided a safe environment to work our program is based on a systems
management approach that ensures continuous improvement the way we operate and measure performance globally is consistent with widely accepted
standards and practices that meet or exceed the ilo guidelines for occupational health management systems our goal is to achieve and maintain
world class safety performance some of the key practices and challenges we face in achieving that goal are

1 use of standard us osha definitions to measure injury and illness rates globally we believe using injury and illness rates based on consistent
definitions are the most objective measure of success and reducing them is how a safety program provides value to employees and shareholders

2 use of widely acceptable standards for the most critical safety processes such as control of hazardous energy and working with hazardous
substances such standards apply to all of our locations worldwide regardless of local regulatory requirements these standards are applied through our
corporate bos document

3 use of established management system techniques to assure that injury rate reductions are real and sustainable we distribute a monthly safety
report to all management in which rates are pulled from our chess system the report helps facilities understand how they are doing also every
plant listed in the report is required to develop a formal action plan for improving safety and health the plan identifies specific goals ie
improvements in injury and losttime case rates timetables and responsible persons the planning process is defined in a companywide safety
management system document this helps all facilities clearly define targets consistent with company expectations ultimately driving continuous
improvement included in the management system is a requirement for all facilities to follow standard safety and environmental management system
practices as defined in our corporate processes which are based on the occupational safety and health assessment series 18001 an internationally

recognized standard

4 verifying the accuracy of selfreported safety and health data we use thirdparty auditors to verify data and the overall safety program the audit
matches the requirements in the safety and health standard so that compliance with the standard is required to pass the audit a locations that fails to
pass the audit cannot earn a safety award any issues uncovered during an audit must be tracked and corrected by the locations in a timely manner
audit data is used as a basis to create safety improvement action plans

5 johnson controls has entered into a fiveyear licensing agreement with electrolab for use and duplication rights to safestart  an advanced
safety awareness training program this program is applicable to all johnson controls work environments because it teaches individuals to recognize
and correct unintentional errors that can lead to injury whether at work home or on the road

during the period october 1 2011  september 30 2012 28 incidents categorized as discrimination were logged into the jci ethics hotline
during the period october 1 2010  september 30 2011 68 incidents categorized as discriminationharassment were logged into the jci ethics
hotline
during the period october 1 2009  september 30 2010 25 incidents categorized as discrimination were logged into the jci ethics hotline


the ethics hotline is not the only channel that management relies on for reporting of incidents by employees rather it is one of only several
communication vehicles that employees can use to report discrimination incidents most often employees discuss such issues directly with their
supervisor this reflects the fact that most issues that come up every day are being handled at the local plant or office level with local managers and
supervisors we consider the ethics hotline a last resort channel for employees as we know that most discrimination issues are dealt with between
the employee and supervisor before needing to be reported via the hotline we are not able to track the number of incidents globally that may occur
on a local level

outside of the ethics hotline 92 complaints in fy 2012 77 complaints in fy2011 and 71 complaints in fy 2010 and were reported alleging
wrongful employment action this includes lawsuits agency charges and attorney letters these numbers are tracked by our outside legal counsel
and our legal department within the business

discrimination is defined as any act or omissions which fails to meet the standards of the equal opportunity commission eeoc which includes
all types of discrimination to include based race religion age nationality sex sexual orientation or disability further breakdown of the
discrimination type is not specifically tracked in the hotline status of incidents tracked by outside legal counsel 3 cases open from fy2011 none
open from fy2010 actions taken as a result of the investigation conclusions include warnings to employees employee counseling leadership

operations identified in which the right to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining may be
at significant risk and actions taken to support these rights

 there are no operations within johnson controls that have been identified being at significant risk for employees to exercise the right to freedom
 of association or collective bargaining

 this type of risk is addressed with our employees including all managers who are involved in labor relations through our human rights 
 sustainability policy and ethics policy which covers a wide range of financial social and environmental activities including safe and healthful
 workplaces diversity discrimination freedom of association regulatory compliance and environmental protection antibribery etc

 the basics of our human rights  sustainability policy and ethics policy are communicated to employees around the world through training
 programs and shop floor discussions and announcements and articles that are posted on our internal and external web site for example our
 managers and supervisors are required to take the annual certification of our ethics policy it is communicated to our employees in the following
 ways
  all new employees upon being hired are required to sign that they have read understand and will comply with our ethics policy as a condition of
 employment
  all salaried employees must complete online ethics certification which is a two part process the certification requires completion of three ethics
 training modules available in 26 languages which focus on different ethicsrelated topics each year as a refresher and a review of the ethics
 policy available in 32 languages
  employees for whom certification is not required must demonstrate that they know and understand the ethics policy as part of their job
 appraisals each year since we launched the online ethics training in 2001 our number of participants has grown and we have achieved 100
 percent compliance with training requirements
  the ethics policy is addressed by our managers regularly in employee meetings
  the ethics policy is frequently addressed through the tone at the top whenever our leadership team provides communications throughout the
 year to employees employee portal inperson meetings web casts emails to employees etc
  the ethics policy is a topic addressed at our annual vision week which is a week each year focused on employee engagement with a special
 focus on our vision and values
  all leaders are required to comply with the leadership expectations model of which the ethical behavior outlined in the ethics policy is one of
 the core elements

 johnson controls requires the line management of each facility to ensure implementation of the equal opportunity and no harassment policies in
 accordance with national state or provincial law additionally the corporate vice president of human resources monitors implementation and
 compliance to these policies employees temporary employees visitors and other nonemployees are encouraged to immediately report situations
 of harassment committed by anyone including visitors and other nonemployees they are asked to report the matter to their department manager
 plantfacility manager or local human resources manager johnson controls wants to know of any harassment or unfair practice so that
 appropriate action can be taken after a prompt investigation

 we seek to create an environment that removes barriers and promotes inclusion fosters effective recruitment development motivation and
 retention so that each is able to maximize his or her contribution to meeting business objectives to ensure our processes are working properly and
 that employees customers and shareholders understand our policies and guiding principles around treatment respectability and integrity we
 systematically gather feedback and take action to improve our work environment we track analyze and communicate performance outcomes
 quarterly

 through our integrity helpline monitoring system we capture all information investigate audit and implement improvement actions accordingly
 this anonymous hotline is available to anyone who suspects unethical behavior at the company the hotline available 24 hours a day in all major
 languages is operated by an independent thirdparty vendor we identify concerns through the callers the purpose of the call origin ie phone or
 email country business group the information is categorized by incidents ie harassment fraud discrimination calls are tracked for content
 and monitored for indication of higher incidents of volume these incidents are assigned to the appropriate group general counsel to ensure a
 factfinding and an appropriate resolution is implemented a followup occurs to review the assessment and execute proposed resolution our
 general counsel also analyzes the incidents for trends and implements improvement actions as appropriate if a particular region or business unit
 is trending in a problematic direction the company schedules special training classes for that particular region or business unit analysis of the
 incidents provides input into the selection of the annual ethics training modules in which all employees participate


 in addition employees are encouraged to discuss issues directly with their supervisor this reflects the fact that most issues that come up every
 day are being handled at the local plant or office level with local managers and supervisors we consider our 24hour integrity helpline a last
 resort channel for employees as we know that most discrimination issues are dealt with between the employee and supervisor before needing to
 be reported via the helpline we are not able to track the number of incidents globally that may occur on a local level

johnson controls inc jci operated three manufacturing facilities in and near puebla mexico in 20082010 the facilities became the focus of labor
issue allegations by external stakeholders some of the issues were related to freedom of association for instance employee dissatisfaction with the
unions that were in place in response in 2010 jci voluntarily invited verité a highly respected independent nonprofit organization specializing in
evaluating international labor rights issues to audit the facilities the intent of the audit was to determine independently which allegations were factual
so a corrective action plan could be developed to effectively address each allegation

a corrective action plan was devised and implmented an executive summary of the audit and corrective action plan was shared and discussed with the
interested external stakeholders we have also appointed a full time individual to monitor corective plan implementation and to work closely with
employees and unions to prevent a reoccurence facility supervisory personnel have been retrained as well one of the plants in puebla has since been
closed due to economic reasons

since these corrective actions were implemented there have been no allegations regarding collective bargaining issues in the region

johnson controls employs security personnel either directly or through vendors and their responsibility is primarily physical security all such
personnel are sufficiently qualified and are trained in our ethics policy no human rights violations or complaints have ever been observed or reported
by these personnel

additionally more than 55000 of our managers and salaried employees around the world are trained and required to formally certify with our ethics
policy annually during 2012 100 percent of those required to complete certification did so employees who take the ethics certification are required
to complete a quiz with a 80 completion rate in order for the certification to be considered complete

employees for whom certification is not required receive a copy of the ethics policy and must sign and agree that they have received the policy and
that they will abide by the ethics policy as it applies to their job

                           results in minimal impact and when there is impact that it is mostly positive

                           in most cases where we are entering a market our business has a positive impact on the local society for example
                           in our building efficiency business the vast majority of company acquisitions and equity investments most being
                           smaller familyheld service or technology companies we did not layoff anyone postdeal in fact the value of the
                           business to jci was dependent on retaining people in a service company or a technology company the people are
                           indeed the greatest asset

                           in addition when we acquire a company and bring it into the johnson controls family we bring many positives to
                           our new employees and thus to their communities

                           because of our size our hr skills and our commitment to our employees jci provides better benefits at a better
                           cost to the employees than predeal
                           our financial business case for the acquisition rests on our ability to help the newlyacquired company grow if we
                           cant help it grow or if we have to build in layoffs to make the numbers work jcis executive management wont
                           approve it
                           because we do more things in more buildings in more countries for comfort energy efficiency and sustainability
                           than any other company we can provide a career path for talented people that a small company could never do
                            and each local employee trying to help a customer can draw on the resources of an entire global company
                            because were a big company we can weather the storms in the economy providing more job stability than a
                           smaller company can
                            we bring standard and stateoftheart financial and information technology systems to the acquired company
                           which frees up the local employees to concentrate of taking care of customers not internal systems
                            we bring jcis eeo and diversity programs to the newlyacquired company which most small companies do not

                 japan  plant closure 2009
                 when ae japan closed our mooka plant one of our 5 plants at the end of sep 2009 the leadership team decided to
                 take actions aiming to secure our employees jobs in their cities of residence after plant closure as much as possible

                 nearby their city of residence or transferring to other plants

                 and the executive director operations were present during the communication we explained to the employees the
                 reasons for the closure ie the global economic crisis
                 2 severance compensation  employees were given a package which is above the statutory requirement 2 keys
                 reasons contributed to this management decision firstly the closure happened during the economic crisis and
                 securing another job might take a longer time secondly most if not all of our vietnam employees had less than 3
                 years of service this means that the severance in accordance to the local law would be no more than 3 months
                 salary
                 3 outplacement  hr contacted several companies in the vicinity and arranged for interviews for our employees
                 professional employees were given good reference letter it is heartening to note that the majority of the salaried

responsibility for participant inclusion is driven by the local payroll system thus regardless of a stated business unit or current physical location all
employees meeting the above criteria who are on a local human resources payroll system will fall under the jurisdiction of that local human resources
department the business units can in their judgment expand these definitions of which employees are subject to the ethics policy certification to
include other employees as they consider appropriate

c2
from time to time incidents that may involve corruption arise and in each case the company investigates and takes appropriate actions at this time
we have limited systems in place globally to track the number of incidents of dismissal or discipline due to corruption as many incidents are not
labeled as such incidents are typically not strictly identified as corruption rather they are usually a confluence of varied behavioral characteristics
which lead to the dismissal or discipline of an employee however when allegations of corruption are identified the company investigates and takes
action as warranted
c3
please see note in c2 which also applies to business partners for suppliers that we have stopped doing business with because of corruption we
classify suppliers do not use do not pay dnudnp if there have been integrityfraud issues in some cases as part of our due diligence process
we discover things about potential suppliers that would prevent us from using them in the first place existing suppliers we stopped using for integrity
concerns and vetted suppliers we wont use are on this dnudnp list the issues might not have been able to be proved as corruption in the legal
sense and would not have resulted in prosecution we are not aware of any such cases however johnson controls had enough concern to make our
judgment for such suppliers as dnudnp in fy2012 69 suppliers fy2011 11 suppliers fy2010 6 suppliers in fy2009 18 suppliers were listed
on this dnudnp list due to ethical issues the addition of suppliers to our dnudnp list is indicative of the continuing scrutiny the company
places on ensuring appropriate business practices throughout the world

public policy positions and participation in public policy development and lobbying

  please explain the significant issues that are the focus of organizationallevel not individual operationlevel participation in public policy
  development and lobbying
  during the period the company lobbied on issues related to energy legislation including advanced vehicle batteries and energy
  efficiency all lobbying was done in the us and not outside of the us our company lobbies on a limited number of issues that are
  important to the growth of our business our lobbying is conducted with the us congress federal agencies on policy issues including
  the departments of energy and defense our lobbying and advocacy efforts are often in conjunction with the efforts of organizations that
  we belong such as the business council for sustainable energy the alliance to save energy and the american council for an energy
  efficient economy we also lobby with our business trade groups such as the national association of energy service companies the
  national association of manufacturers and the electric drive transportation association

  the product and service offerings that occur from these efforts also benefit our customers and society as a whole an example of this
  would be the advanced battery technology to advancement of hybrid technology and the use of it for improved automobile fuel efficiency
  and reduction of gasoline consumption another example is working on energy efficiency policy that promotes retrofitting commercial and
  government buildings such policies lead to saving money on energy use as well as cleaner and healthier work environment

  our ethics policy states within the united states no contribution of funds or services are to be made to or on behalf of any political
  organization or candidate by johnson controls or any of our subsidiary companies without advance approval by the legal department
  andor the diversity  public affairs department

  please explain the core positions held on each of the reported issues above and explain any significant differences between lobbying
  positions and state policies sustainability goals or other public positions
  the companys position on energy legislation and energy efficiency is in line with the goals of the federal and state governments in the
  desire to reduce green house gases and the carbon footprint of commercial buildings and residential homes

  through our combined product and service portfolio we help our customers to reduce costs increase facility performance and reduce their
  overall environmental footprint in an effort to green their organizations we have a very significant role in promoting energy efficiency
  the company deals with waning energy sources by introducing more renewables such as solar power biomass geothermals and turbines
  renewable energy is a natural extension of the companys energy efficiency performance contracting business because it gives customers
  the opportunity to realize monetary benefits from energy efficiency that can be applied to renewable energy solutions as an industry
  leader we have a responsibility to drive sustainability initiatives green building and be energy efficiency champions we are going to
  make lighter cars lighter materials hybrid electric vehicle batteries and we will be the green building experts

c2
there are no allegations proven in which johnson controls was found to be guilty however from time to time these issues involving
anticompetitive or antitrust practices do arise typically the issues are a confluence of several factors that lead to the legal action and are not
specifically just anticompetitive issues globally it is difficult to track the numbers of these incidents as they may not be classified as just
anticompetitive or antitrust issues the company does anticipate these issues and engages significant resources to train our employees on how to
avoid such behavior or incidents the company requires online ethics compliance training for all managers and supervisors globally which equate to
more than 55000 employees this training informs employees on how to deal appropriately with customers suppliers and others in the marketplace
for all employees compliance with our ethics policy is a condition of employment we are putting more resources towards identifying and capturing
data relevant to the business and over time these tracking mechanisms will improve

additional comments
in the normal course of business the company becomes involved from time to time in proceedings which allege violations of the antitrust and other
competition laws all matters are investigated and then litigated or settled so as to resolve the matters with no significant consequence to the
company

our ethics policy states that employees must act in compliance with antitrust laws and ethical behavior regarding competitive information as well as
compliance with laws affecting international business

additional comments
our global operations are governed by environmental laws and worker safety laws johnson controls has expended substantial resources globally
both financial and managerial to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws and to protect the environment and workers
the company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance however the
company has been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with
such laws or the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved by negotiation with
regulatory authorities resulting in commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties
historically neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the company have been material see our sec filings above form 10k

as noted in the 10k there were no substantive fines this past fiscal year

 johnson controls provides products and services through its three businesses  automotive experience building efficiency and power solutions
 while the requirements for safety will change based upon the operating group involved each of those groups has the following common elements
 embedded in their quality operating systems
  a phased approach to design and development to assure that safety requirements are understood and that the design of the product or service is
 capable of complying with those requirements
  thirdparty audits of quality operating systems
  monitoring of field results and application of lessons learned to improve the design and development process

 customer satisfaction is the source of employee shareholder supplier and community benefits satisfied customers enable us to attract and hire
 good employees provide a competitive return to shareholders offer business to suppliers and enhance our standing within communities where we
 work striving to exceed customers expectations is consistent with our corporate objective to be a market leader we recognize that because
 customer expectations are always increasing continuous improvement is essential the responsibility for monitoring customer satisfaction resides
 within the board of directors and within business unit management

 central to our efforts to satisfy customers is our global continuous improvement initiative which combines and integrates key elements of our
 quality programs the initiative has three main interconnected elements

 six sigma this globally recognized business improvement process uses scientific datadriven methods to improve quality by finding and
 eliminating root causes of variations in processes it is proven effective for achieving gains in quality productivity safety customer satisfaction
 and profitability johnson controls launched its six sigma initiative companywide in 1999

 lean manufacturing this set of disciplines also widely recognized in manufacturing circles focuses on eliminating waste and achieving
 production at the pace of customer demand thus minimizing use of resources throughout the supply chain

 best business practices this johnson controls program objectively measures plans or work teams to determine which is best in class in a given
 area then identifies and shares best practices to bring all participants up to the level of the best

 in addition our business operating system bos initiative defines and standardizes best practices in product development manufacturing
 purchasing and administrative functions such as finance and human resources it ensures uniformity in dealing with customers and brings prompt
 measurable quality improvements

 our three businesses are structured differently with regard to customer feedback integration based on customer needs

 our automotive experience business provides mobile phones to our plant managers and our customer business unit vice presidents and general
 managers as well as an internet site for customer feedback

 our building efficiency business has an online customer portal and also has a technologyprocess strategy for customer relationship management
 throughout the next five years it will include all customer data and linked to appropriate databases for problem resolution the business has also
 contracted an independent group to conduct customer satisfaction surveys with its facility management customers

 our power solutions group has contracted an independent group to conduct periodic customer satisfaction studies with several key customers it
 also has an internal customer action system cas where customer complaints and issues are entered into an electronic database the issues are
 assigned to a specific person and status reports are automatically generated to ensure that issues are closed in a timely manner

 instead of having a customer complaint center johnson controls assigns dedicated account representatives who correspond with their customers
 daily

 compliance with customer service quality standards customer quality standards vary according to business and customer for example within
 our automotive experience group general motors provides monthly service ratings to indicate whether our plants are shipping within
 agreedupon time frames we perform very well to those metrics

 within our power solutions business we are qs9000ts16949 thirdparty certified in each of our manufacturing plants we conduct internal and
 thirdparty audits in compliance with these standards we also conduct monthly quality operating system qos reviews with the executive staff
 to review key quality measures customer issues and corrective actions

 we use various methods to monitor customer satisfaction one of these is customer recognition advanced auto parts honored johnson controls
 with its vendor of the year award for providing the highest quality product excellent fulfillment services and strong customer service and
 marketing support automotive industries magazine recognized johnson controls in its 2004 quest for excellence awards as the top automotive
 supplier in seating overhead systems instrument cluster instrument panel and entertainment systems categories ford world excellence award
 was awarded to the company in the customerdriven six sigma category for product development for six sigma pdfss headrest quality
 project please see gri 210 for a listing of awards received from customers and third parties

 we also rely on regular customer surveys one such survey in our building efficiency business shows that 87 percent of control system sales are to
 repeat customers and that 94 percent of customers on service contracts renew those contracts when they expire

 automotive experience uses research conducted by jd powers  associates to assess customer satisfaction and also measures interior defect rate
 reports and customer awards for performance

 health and safety impacts
c1
while we are in various stages of maturity for systematic consideration of health and safety of our product during development we are at an early
stage of applying a similar protocol to services development
c2
during product development products are assessed to assure appropriate safety requirements are in place and to assure that there is an appropriate
plan to achieve performance consistent with those safety requirements we dont have a regular safety review process for the service side of our
business in be there are different levels of maturity in product business lines and regions for this type of discipline
c3
this type of assessment is in place in automotive and in hybrid battery groups this type of discipline does not exist in our be group currently for
rd areas but does exist for more conventional launch of existing concepts
c4
there is no certification requirements applicable to our sli battery products either on a component or vehicle basis there are vehicle level
certification requirements relating to components that we provide to our customers while our customers do the actual certification we do component
level validations to assure that they have comfort with the level of safety in those components those validations at a component level are per the
specification of our customers similarly for hybrid batteries we do component level validation of our components to provide comfort to our
customers on the certification requirements they have in our be group we have third party agencies certify our consumer hvac product to various
consensus standards that have safety requirements particularly in europe and in the china markets although in other emerging markets as regulatory
schemes evolve we work with third party certification agencies to achieve requirements for certification specified in those countries
c5
inplant checks for safety compliance are part of the development process and post production review in the automotive group no current product
safety discipline exists for this in our power solutions and building efficiency groups although recent efforts have initiated similar review efforts in
these groups there are regular quality reviews of plants in these areas however which occasionally result in a followup on potential safety issues

in our automotive and sli battery groups marketing and promotion is done by our customers in our be group installation literature and user
literature is reviewed by our engineering and service groups for appropriate content additionally these technical reviews are augmented by reviews
by subject matter legal experts as needed and requested particularly on labeling and instructions issues
c7
a principle consideration of our power solutions group is consideration of the handling of sli and hybrid batteries during distribution both of which
pertain to assuring that the hazardous contents of the batteries remain within the battery and are not released to the environment automotive product
which we provide complies with end of life directives and imds disciplines worldwide additionally some components which we handle and ship
in the automotive area example pretensioners used on belts incorporated into our seats include safe handling instructions for shipment and use
finally in our be group we provide instructions for proper handling of refrigerant content such as in the case of commercial refrigeration equipment
c8
consumer products sold by our building efficiency group include user and service literature which are reviewed by engineering and service for
appropriate safety content for our ae ps and commercial be groups service is provided other than through our company or distribution systems
that we have in place that service is provided through the customer
c9
recycling and appropriate disposal of the hazardous materials in batteries sold by our power solutions group are considered as part of the plan for the
product life cycle during development where applicable we use imds and end of life directives as guidance for establishing proper disposal or
recycling of our product
c12
no service categories which are in our be group currently have a qos approach to service safety in general our products all have a phase
methodology approach to detect and prevent safety issues additionally our products employ and associated service areas generally employ a
structured approach to reporting quality issues that have safety implications where there is no associated product offering for the service we do not
have a structured method of reporting those type of issues based on the progress in be in terms of putting a structured approach to safety in product
development in the past year the increase of that business mix for the company and the introduction of a line certification methodology for safety in
our ae groups we are increasing the percentage by two points the gap to 100 is largely attributable to the lack of structured disciplines in service
offerings unconnected with products

 please describe any product safety controversies the company has experienced within the last three years
 include information about any fines settlements or courtimposed awards and indicate dates amounts and any
 cases involving fatalities
 while the company faces certain product liability cases which are brought against its products from time to
 time none of those cases have involved actions for noncompliance with an applicable regulatory or voluntary
 code and fines settlements or court imposed awards for such noncompliance

 the company does have a process for determining whether products in the field have nonconformities that
 might be the source of potential product safety concerns it regularly monitors field performance and
 performance in the factory to determine whether any nonconformities in our product could be the source of
 those types of concerns if we determine that such circumstances exist ie nonconformities that could cause
 safety concerns in the field we either work with our customer to determine the correct field response in cases
 where we supply the component and not the entire end product or determine the correct field actions if our
 product is the product sold to the end user in doing so we determine any requirements for reporting such
 actions promulgated by applicable regulatory agencies and report our actions consistent with those reporting
 requirements
c1
the sli batteries do not have regulatory requirements for safety performance with which the company is required to comply any compliance
requirements for automotive or hybrid battery products is at a vehicle level not a component requirement and compliance in those cases is certified
by our customers with the exception of china and europe where some component level certifications are required but handled in the ordinary course
through third party approval protocols consumer products in our be group americas are not subject to regulatory requirements however to the
extent they are subject to voluntary standards which include safety requirements compliance with those standards is validated through certification by
third party agencies this is particularly true in our be group in overseas applications for consumer products third party approval requirements exist
for consumer products in certain markets eg in the european union and we comply with those
c6
in our be group we do subscribe to certifying to various voluntary codes such as ansi or ul where we use a third party to certify our compliance
with those voluntary codes as is common in those instances where such a protocol is in place those third party agencies periodically review the
status of our certifications to assure that there are no nonconformities that exist to the extent that nonconformities are raised during this process
we address those nonconformities to assure that certification of compliance with the codes stay in place we have not had instances where a
nonconformity has been identified and a certification of compliance has been withdrawn as a result

for our batteries certain on product labels advise the consumer regarding the distributor of the battery per the requirements of fhsa other products
do not generally have labels that advise of the name of the manufacturer but where imported do reflect the country of origin consistent with customs
requirements additionally batteries do post recycle information on the battery display areas that recycle information is also reinforced by processes
for educating distributors on the importance of recycling of batteries economic benefits of recycling and financial consideration for recycling also
the motivate distributors and assure that batteries are recycled strategies for recycling of hybrid batteries are currently under consideration and
development in our automotive components group we are using recent legislation in european countries on recyclability of automotive products as
guidelines for the use of more sustainablerecycleable materials in our components much of the content of our be products involves recycled
materials various business groups within the company are highlighting these efforts with consumers through marketing efforts

of sale procedures in place to facilitate the recycling of those batteries
c9
reevaluating this category and have gone from 50 to 75 focus in the past years was on actual product with labels focus this year is on the
categories that we do actual assessment of the requirements for safety that include labels based on the protocol and consistent with the assessment
for pr1 we have raised the percentage based on where we do assessments which is larger than the number where we require labels with the recent
advent of reach legislation in europe which requires explicit addressing of hazardous content in our product to assure that there are no bars to
recycling we have reassessed our product subject to this type of assessment upwards in 2009 our focus is on assessment of the products for
compliance which we believe to be the intent of this inquiry

practices related to customer satisfaction including results of surveys measuring customer satisfaction

 customer satisfaction is the source of employee shareholder supplier and community benefits satisfied customers enable us to attract and hire
 good employees provide a competitive return to shareholders offer business to suppliers and enhance our standing within communities where we
 work striving to exceed customers expectations is consistent with our corporate objective to be a market leader we recognize that because
 customer expectations are always increasing continuous improvement is essential the responsibility for monitoring customer satisfaction resides
 within the board of directors and within business unit management

 central to our efforts to satisfy customers is our global continuous improvement initiative which combines and integrates key elements of our
 quality programs the initiative has three main interconnected elements

 six sigma this globally recognized business improvement process uses scientific datadriven methods to improve quality by finding and
 eliminating root causes of variations in processes it is proven effective for achieving gains in quality productivity safety customer satisfaction
 and profitability johnson controls launched its six sigma initiative companywide in 1999

 lean manufacturing this set of disciplines also widely recognized in manufacturing circles focuses on eliminating waste and achieving
 production at the pace of customer demand thus minimizing use of resources throughout the supply chain

 best business practices this johnson controls program objectively measures plans or work teams to determine which is best in class in
 a given area then identifies and shares best practices to bring all participants up to the level of the best

 in addition our business operating system bos initiative defines and standardizes best practices in product development manufacturing
 purchasing and administrative functions such as finance and human resources it ensures uniformity in dealing with customers and brings prompt
 measurable quality improvements

 our three businesses are structured differently with regard to customer feedback integration based on customer needs our automotive experience
 business provides mobile phones to our plant managers and our customer business unit vice presidents and general managers as well as an
 internet site for customer feedback

 our building efficiency business has an online customer portal and also has a technologyprocess strategy for customer relationship management
 throughout the next five years it will include all customer data and linked to appropriate databases for problem resolution the business has also
 contracted an independent group to conduct customer satisfaction surveys with its facility management customers

 our power solutions group has contracted an independent group to conduct periodic customer satisfaction studies with several key customers it
 also has an internal customer action system cas where customer complaints and issues are entered into an electronic database the issues are
 assigned to a specific person and status reports are automatically generated to ensure that issues are closed in a timely manner

 instead of having a customer complaint center johnson controls businesses assign dedicated account representatives who correspond with their
 customers daily


additional comments
compliance with customer service quality standards customer quality standards vary according to business and customer
for example within our automotive experience group general motors provides monthly service ratings to indicate whether our plants are shipping
within agreedupon time frames we perform very well to those metrics

within our power solutions business we are qs9000ts16949 thirdparty certified in each of our manufacturing plants we conduct internal and
thirdparty audits in compliance with these standards we also conduct monthly quality operating system qos reviews with the executive staff to
review key quality measures customer issues and corrective actions

we use various methods to monitor customer satisfaction one of these is customer recognition please see gri 210 for a full listing of awards
received by customers in past fiscal year

we also rely on regular customer surveys one such survey in our building efficiency business shows that 87 percent of control system sales are to
repeat customers and that 94 percent of customers on service contracts renew those contracts when they expire

automotive experience uses research conducted by jd powers  associates to assess customer satisfaction and also measures interior defect rate
reports and customer awards for performance

in our building efficiency consumer group an 800 number methodology is used to obtain field data on customer complaints regarding our product
