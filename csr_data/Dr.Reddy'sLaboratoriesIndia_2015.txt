been left unsolved for too long with every passing day more people are bearing the brunt when they shouldnt have to while we are all

urgent basis we are contributing to business environment and social crises of epic proportions

    green chemistry
    dr reddys is accelerating the use of green chemistry to reduce or eliminate generation of hazardous substances we have developed green
    chemistry metrics in association with the american chemical society green chemistry institute to monitor and manage various aspects such
    as atom e ciency efactor reaction mass intensity and energy e ciency we consistently implement these metrics to improve safety health
    and environmental performance and to optimise resources conserve energy and enhance productivity

in the reporting period we fasttracked our e orts in nding more
sustainable means of synthesis than traditional chemistry approaches
following are some of the improvements that we made to our
processes

eslicarbazepine acetate
the earlier process involved ve steps and the overall yield was
found to be 13 with a highly unfavourable efactor of more than
800 kg the improved process involves three steps and 80 yield
efactor has improved by almost 10 times 88 kg

voriconazole
the earlier process involved six steps and the overall yield was found
to be 56 with a highly unfavourable efactor the improved
process involves six steps and 191 yield has been achieved
the efactor has improved to 40 kg

pregabaline
the earlier process involved sodium hypobromide with an
unfavourable efactor now sodium hypobromide has been replaced
with sodium hypochloride reducing the efactor close to 21 kg
