ceo message
dear business partners

as senapastampa despite the turbulence in the world economy we have realized our growth targets and in
doing so we have tried to raise the standards in our packaging sector

beside our quality and efficiency targets we have also added the sustainability goals in this sense in the
first instance we worked in our own internal environment in the field of environmental sustainability and
incorporated the concept of sustainability into the main principles of our corporate culture now taking
this one step further we present it to the information of our business partners with the
internationally accepted gri framework

it is our responsibility to leave a liveable world for our children careful use of resources
is often emphasized when this responsibility is described as companies that transform
plastics i would like to emphasize that we also need to be sensitive about efficient use
of available resources on the other hand climate change is an important issue in the
future of the world and unfortunately most of us are not aware of this as it is already
known important decisions were taken in the declaration published at the end of the
united nations climate change paris conference on climate change thats why we
care about even the smallest steps to improve our carbon footprint

also in the plastic packaging sector it is obvious that the sustainability will become
even more challenging in the coming years we create many projects in many areas
such as energy saving water consumption reduction and reduction of wastes i would
like to emphasize the necessity of creating projects in the field of social responsibility
as well in the coming period

in summary we know that success can be achieved through the contribution of our
employees at every level training and encouraging everyone to contribute to the
actions to be taken are very important at this point we want to underline that our
customers approach is very much encouraging us

last but not least we would like to thank our employees suppliers and business
partners for their contributions

kind regards

corporate profile
our story

                                     the merger of the senapa and stampa companies has put our
                                          company in a position to compete with the world



senapastampa was born from the merger of two important corporations which have more than a quarter of a century of industry experience
and have dedicated themselves to the packaging industry since the 1950s when stampa which started production of plastic bottles in
1973 as a strategic partner of unilever and senapa which was a joint venture with the french company carnaud in 1988 merged into one
company called senapastampa it reached a position where it could compete strongly with the rest of the world

this merger which is basically the integration of our country with the global economy led us to become the market leader in cosmetic
detergent and food plastic packaging besides this in general total we also have an important share in the production of plastic packaging
from 50 ml to 20 l used in the pharmaceutical food mineral oil cosmetic and detergent sectors

our targets as a leading company in the sector in addition to producing customized products is to develop standard product ranges to
pioneer sectoral developments and to increase our current business partnerships with our customers who are the giants of their sectors
with our strong customer portfolio and by taking steps in the direction of fulfilling our targets in the long and challenging business life we
always give support to our local and multinational customers who produce fast consumer goods we will always continue to provide services
in plastic bottles  caps that we are experts in

supply chain management

the quality of the products we offer is related to the quality of raw materials used and our performance in our operational activities is
related to the quality of our suppliers for products and services for this reason sustainability of the supply chain has always been an issue
with great importance for us

as senapastampa we preevaluate all supplier and subcontractor candidates from which we purchase products and services in
accordance with the senapastampa supplier selection and performance procedure we categorize suppliers and subcontractors at 4
groups


group i                 our raw material suppliers which directly affect our products and services

group ii                paint packaging and sleeve label suppliers

group iii               our product and service suppliers which indirectly affect our products and services

group iv                our suppliers of products and services that do not affect the quality and cost of our products and services

department and our department managers according to relevant criteria and evaluation methods

                                                   2 it reduces the size and weight of products requiring transport cutting fuel use per item

waste and wastewater management
we manage waste and wastewater from our production activities in senapastampa according to our waste plan which we have prepared
for each of our three factories in our company we are investigating ways in which to prevent the primary source of waste we try to keep
the amount of waste at the lowest level by trying to reduce our unavoidable wastes by applying certain methods
we carry out processes such as waste reduction collection separation and recycling by licensed companies in our production facility in
gebze within the iso 14001 environmental management system that we obtained in 2013 for our çerkezköy and adana plants obtaining
the iso 14001 environmental management system certificate is among our future targets

disposal of our waste is carried out in accordance with the following regulations published by the republic of turkey ministry of
environment and urbanism
      waste management regulation
      regulation on the control of waste electrical and electronic equipment
      regulation of control of waste batteries and accumulators
      packaging waste control regulation and
      regulation on the control of waste oils

in addition to ensure continuous followup of national and international environmental regulations and to fulfill our obligations under this
scope we receive services from an environmental consulting firm approved by the ministry of environment and urbanization in turkey in
this context according to the waste plan prepared for each of our three plants we separate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes at the
source and send hazardous wastes to a licensed firm for disposal


solid waste
in senapastampa we classify solid wastes arising from our operational activities as follows

waste categories                     examples
packaging waste                      plastic bottles paper carton cardboard etc
hazardous waste                      waste oil contaminated waste etc
electronic waste                     fluorescent light bulbs etc

we follow our wooden pallets from our packaging waste after delivery to our customers and ask for them to return to our facility for reuse as
much as possible we use the returned pallets again after repairing them in our production facility

we send the plastic bottle products we produce to our customers packed in paper  cardboard trays and parcels we chase these paper 
cardboard trays and packages with the aim of recovering and recycling if these packaging materials are not fit to recycle we send them for
scrap and if they are fit for use we use these in the packaging of nonfood products




                                         as a packaging manufacturer the reuse of paper 
                                       cardboard pans and boxes used in the packaging of our
                                                    products is essential for us



we believe that an important way to reduce the amount of waste is to raise the environmental awareness of our employees to the highest
level while we continue our production processes in this context we provide training regularly for our employees at our company we
support all our employees from top management to manual labour in being sensitive individuals who attach importance to this issue we
provided our employees with 182 hours and 245 hours of environmental training in 2014 and 2015 respectively

wastewater management
in our facility in gebze domestic wastewater is sent to the gebze organized industrial zone gosb wastewater treatment plant before it
is discharged into the receiving environment the domestic wastewater sent to the gosb waste water treatment plant must comply with
the necessary standards before discharge for this purpose gosb regularly checks the analysis of wastewater every two months in the
analysis performed parameters such as chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod suspended solids ss
and ph are measured in the case of any parameters not complying with standards senapastampa takes all the necessary actions without
losing any time and we take corrective measures to ensure these values are within the relevant standard values

resource and energy management
in our production process electricity constitutes our complete energy use by 2015 thanks to the recovery of waste heat from the
compressor our plant in gebze has greatly reduced the consumption of natural gas for heating electric lpg and diesel fuel forklifts are
used in our production facilities the vehicles we use on our business trips have diesel and gas consumption
whilst our total annual energy consumption in senapastampa was 1265 toe in 2014 this figure decreased to 1182 toe in 2015 within
the scope of the regulation on increasing the efficiency of energy sources and energy use industrial enterprises with over 1000 teps
a year are required to have employees with energy manager certificates so that they can carry out energy management activities in this
scope our electrical engineer is working in our company as the energy manager after obtaining the relevant certificate
we aim to obtain iso 50001 energy management system certification for our production facilities first in gebze then çerkezköy and
adana in order to reduce our energy consumption every year compared to the previous year and to manage them systematically
measurably and in line with concrete targets we have started our iso 50001 operations in gebze production facility and aim to receive our
certificate in 2017 in this context the halogen lights which were used in our administrative and operational offices were changes to 2x58
electronic balancing high visibility and waterproof etange fixtures in 2013 as a direct result of this substitution a 65 energy saving is
achieved in illumination
within the scope of energy efficiency studies from 2015 we started to heat the administrative section of our factory in gebze with the
compressor waste oil heat currently we replaced 90 of the natural gas consumption required for heating of both offices and the
washrooms and cafeteria water with heating from waste oil in this way the consumption of natural gas in the factory was reduced to
almost zero and 158702 kg co2 emission was prevented in addition the inlet water temperature of steam boiler used for the sleeve
labeling process in is increased from 1  10c to 80  85c by utilizing the compressor waste heat for preheating

climate change
as senapastampa climate change is undoubtedly one of the most important issues in our business processes we began to feel the
effects of the climate change with serious events everywhere in the world we are also experiencing concrete environmental threats such
as drought temperature increase and changes in sea levels and the sociological problems that these threats lead to it is an inevitable
reality that all producers who have taken part in the business world in the struggle against climate change which is a great risk for the
whole world in the future should do their duty
in the sector where electricity energy accounts for 95 of total energy usage we have always aimed to work as an example for other
competitors in the sector by managing our carbon footprint by following a sustainable carbon management principle starting from 2013
we began to measure our carbon footprint which stems from our corporate activities the purpose of our carbon footprint work with the
philosophy of we cannot manage it without measuring it is to make our climate change performance always traceable by making our
annual inventory for our intended greenhouse gas emissions and to take robust steps in this respect for this purpose we calculate our
scope 1 2 and 3 emissions for all three production facilities in gebze çerkezköy and adana within the framework of iso 14064 and
greenhouse gas protocol ghg protocol standards
scopes 1 2 and 3 of the ghg protocol contain activities as follows
   scope 1  direct emissions emissions from operations that are owned or controlled by the organization it covers the emissions sourced by fuel
    consumption within the organization process emissions coolingrefrigerant gas emissions fuel consumption of company ownedcontrolled vehicles
   scope 2  indirect emissions emissions resulting from the generation of purchased electricity heating cooling and steam
   scope 3  others direct emissions other indirect emissions such as transportrelated activities in vehicles not owned or controlled by the
    organization outsourced activities waste disposal and water consumption
since our carbon footprint studies were in the initial stages in 2013 we only made measurements at our facility in gebze in 2014 and
2015 we completed our measurements for all three factories in order to maintain consistency the values calculated for 2014 and 2015
are given comparatively

product sustainability
although climate change seems to be the major threat affecting the world and all living things in a negative way many environmental
issues that are yet to be noticed pose a big threat for our future for this reason besides climate change environmental problems such
as thinning of the ozone layer acid rain and ecotoxicity should also be evaluated causes of these should be investigated and reduction
studies should be carried out by setting concrete targets as senapastampa we aim to manage not only our effect on climate change but
also many other environmental effects on the basis of putting these effects into figures with productbased life cycle assessment lca

during our reporting period we identified our hot spots by calculating multiple environmental
impacts in all processes from raw material to product disposal of 1 kg pe pet and hdpe bottles
produced in compliance with the iso 1404044 life cycle assessment standard

environmental impact glossary
global warming
global warming is a concept expressing warming of the atmosphere leading to climate change one of the human activities which has the
greatest effect on global warming is the burning of fossil fuels such as petroleum coal and natural gas in lca global warming is expressed
in terms of the equivalent weight of carbon dioxide co2 emitted

ozone layer depletion
ozone layer depletion is a concept expressing the reduction of ozone in the stratosphere and depletion of the ozone layer the ozone hole
as a consequence of emissions of man made resources such as cfcs hcfcs chlorine bromine etc depletion of the ozone layer is
causing a carcinogenic impact on humans animals and plants in lca ozone layer depletion is expressed in terms of the equivalent weight
of cfc11 emitted

photochemical oxidation
photooxidant formation is the formation of reactive substances mainly ozone which are injurious to human health and ecosystems and
which also may damage crops this problem is also indicated with summer smog winter smog is outside the scope of this category
photochemical ozone creation potential pocp for emission of substances to air is calculated with the unece trajectory model including
fate and expressed in kg c2h4 equivalentskg emission

asidifikasyon
acidification is an impact category expressing the toxic impact that acidifying substances have on soil underground watercourses ground
water organisms ecosystems and materials reaction of acidic gases with water in the atmosphere creates acid rain the formation of acid
rains causes a reduction in biodiversity in lca acidification is expressed in terms of the equivalent weight of sulphur dioxide so2 emitted

eutrophicationnutrification eutrophication
eutrophication is an impact category expressing the impact caused by an increase in the macronutrients formed due to excessive emission of
nutrients to air water and soil although the existence of nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate is vital for continuity of life in the ecosystem
their existence in high concentration causes algal bloom proliferation in wet areas and this gives rise to depletion of the oxygen in the water
this leads to damage to the ecosystem in lca eutrophication is expressed in terms of the equivalent weight of phosphate po43 emitted

resource depletion abiotic depletion
in lca resource depletion is one of the impact categories expressing how much of the worlds natural resources petroleum iron ore etc
are used up it has global regional and local aspects of impact and expresses the amount of mineral  fossil fuel used in lca resource
depletion is expressed in terms of the equivalent weight of antimony sb used
