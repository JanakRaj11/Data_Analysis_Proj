                                         so great that converting one bus from diesel to natural gas is the equivalent of
                                         taking as many as 325 cars off the road so our impact is the equivalent of

investing in businesses and partnerships for longterm growth

while strict fiscal discipline has contributed to much of our success at agl
resources  even in the toughest economic times  we seek new ways to leverage
opportunities for continued growth
     as a publicly held company we have a fiscal responsibility to make pru
dent investments that create shareholder value we also strive to ensure that our
investments provide positive benefits to our other stakeholders  the communities
where we operate and natural gas users across the country
     in october 2009 the georgia public service commission approved atlanta
gas lights stride strategic infrastructure development and enhancement
program this investment in new transmission infrastructure is vital to meeting
future demand for our product and ensuring reliability and integrity particu
larly in north metro atlanta and during peak demand periods under stride
atlanta gas light is also investing in new pipelines to serve homes and businesses
currently without gas service which supports local economic development
     virginia natural gas put our hampton roads crossing pipeline into service
in 2010 linking two areas separated by the chesapeake bay and james river

                                            utilities like ours must meet rigorous federal and state requirements to ensure
                                            that natural gas is delivered safely and efficiently but more than that we hold

                                        be attributed to the 2 percent increase in mileage and to the fact that we replaced
