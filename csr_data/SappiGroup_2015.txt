emissions avoidance value


the emissions avoidance value was calculated
by taking each regional power utilitys emissions
factor and comparing it with sappis internal
power generation emissions factor the
difference between the two factors indicates
that sappis internal power generation is less
carbon intensive in certain regions and therefore                                                                                           consumer concerns about climate change

wateruse in our plantations  south africa
as south africa is a waterstressed country
water usage is a significant focus

our plantations have both positive and negative
impacts on the environment one of the negative
impacts is that generally they use more water
than the grasslands they typically replace there
is considerable variation from place to place
and season to season

on a national scale the water used by plantations
is relatively small  about 3 of available
resources viewed in context irrigated agriculture
uses approximately 60 of south africas
available water resources

restrictions on expansion

serious restrictions on expansion have been
put in place by the south african government
we believe this misguided based on the
following
 as the only designated streamflow reduction
     activity plantation forestry is not irrigated
     but pays for the water it uses in what is
     essentially a rain tax
 our trees are planted away from riparian
     zones thereby decreasing the amount of
     water used
 the quality of water emanating from
     afforested catchments is generally good
     and much better than most other forms of
     agriculture and                                         plantation forestry                      trees are planted away                water emanating from                      value added to the

reducing solid waste and adding value
minimising endoflife waste


sending waste to landfill adds costs adding
value to waste brings in revenue we focus on
minimising endoflife waste through waste
beneficiation which mitigates environmental
impacts reduces wastemanagement costs
and can generate additional revenue

the least desirable method of solid waste
disposal from an environmental perspective is
to discharge to a landfill site because
 organic waste emits methane ch4 a
    greenhouse gas with approximately 25 times
    the global warming potential of co2 and
 inorganic waste can leach resulting in
    surface andor groundwater pollution

globally most of the solid waste we generate
is wood waste  mostly bark in all regions
this is used as a fuel for onsite energy
