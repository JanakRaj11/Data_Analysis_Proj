growth targets across all divisions   our customers and improves our relationships with our employees
                                       supply chain and the communities in which we operate sustainability
which we aim to achieve by 2018       is integral to achieving the groups strategic targets for 2018 and
                                       beyond and is a contributor to our record business achievements
                                       last year i said that getting our people strategy and recruitment
                                       right would be a major factor in achieving our 2018 objectives
                                       to deliver our business growth we have increased our employee
                                       base by 1169 this year although retention remains an industry
                                       wide issue we have implemented several initiatives to enhance
                                       our employee experience including additional benefits and a new
                                       induction process overall our employee engagement remains high
                                       to ensure the availability of future talent we remain committed to
                                       promoting careers in construction and supporting apprenticeship
                                       and trainee schemes through the galliford try academy
                                       conditions in our supply chain remain challenging the availability
                                       of materials has improved but it is still difficult to obtain skilled
                                       tradespeople we have introduced supply chain forums to address
                                       this issue and we use our supply chain business briefing to engage
                                       with our strategic supply chain
                                       our significant business growth alongside the very real trade
                                       skills gap has resulted in an increased number of less experienced
                                       supply chain workers on our sites this may have had an impact on
                                       our health and safety performance our previously aboveaverage
