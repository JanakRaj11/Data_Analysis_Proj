and minimise the use of ballast an optimum trim is the balance of cargo     that are harmful to the environment

can result in more fuel being used to sail hence we devise and             we have a policy of exchanging ballast water only in the open sea 200

in 2005 our kaohsiung container terminal kaoct in taiwan had converted its entire container yard to a green enterprise by replacing its straddle
carriers operation with electric rail mounted gantry cranes rmgs to improve energy and operational efficiencies as a result of the improvements made over
the years electricity consumption throughput decreased by 197 from 173 kwhteu in 2005 to 139 kwhteu in 2016

currently there are a total of 20 electrically powered rmgs in the terminal on a fixedrail system and these gantry cranes are emissionfree quiet and
provide a much safer working environment at the port the equipment has not only helped improve energy efficiency but also terminal efficiency as shipside
productivity improved by 93 from 2005 to 2016 and during this same period the annual throughput also increased by 67 this has enabled kaoct to
effectively handle more vessels at berth and the higher productivity level helped shorten the vessel berthing period to achieve bunker saving as well as
emission reduction


green features of new oocl logistics center in guangzhou

the new oocl logistics center in guangzhou china is part of our strategic initiative to enhance our logistics capabilities and enlarge our domestic logistics
footprint in the country in contributing to environmental protection objectives oocl logistics invested heavily in green facilities for the warehouses at the
center for example skylights are used to provide natural lighting during the day to reduce electricity consumption and ventilation windows are installed to
allow for better air circulation to better control the temperatures in the storage areas thus reducing energy consumption and the need to use in
heatingcooling systems all forklifts operating at the center run on electricity and to minimise waste dedicated areas are assigned for collecting recyclable
items such as used cartons and pallets so that they can be properly recycled or reused in the supply chain

global vessel voyage monitoring centre gvvmc

to enhance fuel saving and improve fleet performance oocl and cargosmart
have been working closely together to utilise the ais signals to monitor all oocl
vessels through cargosmarts gvvmc global vessel voyage monitoring centre
that operates around the clock 247 to track the movements of more than 6500
container vessels and the status of over 1300 container ports

the gvvmc monitors realtime vessel movements to identify exceptions earlier
through stateoftheart and innovative tools the centre would alert the users ie
container liners if speed deviation route deviation or any abnormal activities of a
vessel during the voyage is found allowing for a quicker response to address those
issues the implementation of the gvvmc was a big success in supporting marine
operations to ensure that all containerships are in line with service loop standards and
performance guidelines

lbct installs solar panels at port of long beach

in contributing to a more sustainable environment our long beach container
terminal lbct llc installed a 90475kw photovoltaic pv system at the port of
long beach the pv system was built on the roof of 12 carport structures at two sites
at the port of long beach terminal e it includes 3290 solar modules and has the
potential to generate approximately 1547mwh of energy per year the system is also
expected to help avoid the emission of 1127 tons of carbon dioxide each year as
part of the lbct pier e redevelopment project the pv system will contribute to
making lbct one of the greenest most technologically advanced container terminals
