for deutsche börse group

our clear vision is to turn

 topranked in all its activities

this annual is the accelerated version of our corporate
report key information and to the point the annual com
prises an overview of deutsche börse group and of our
accelerate growth strategy we are looking at the present
state of the group  but of course we will also take a look
ahead to what we have planned for the near future as well
as potential innovations over a longer period we have thus
structured the report into three sections status ambition
and innovation

we accept responsibility in all of these areas not only are
we determined to be the number one for our customers and
investors  we also take the needs and interests of all rel
evant stakeholders into account dialogue and transparency
are key aspects in this context this is why we not only
expanded our stakeholder survey in 2015 but also further
developed our reporting bringing it in line with the stan
dards set by the global reporting initiative gri our annual
and our financial report 2015 have both been prepared in
accordance with the gri g4 framework for the first time

we are looking back at a successful year yet we have no
intention of resting on our laurels we must grow much
faster in the future we have called our strategy  designed
to achieve faster growth  accelerate the purpose of
this strategy is to propel deutsche börse group into the
global number one or number two position  in all of its
business areas

and we are making good progress last year we acquired
the remaining stake in index provider stoxx and also took
over the foreignexchange trading platform 360t an enter
prise that is a blueprint for entrepreneurial courage client
proximity and innovation you can read more about 360t
and its founder carlo kölzer on page 22

talking about client proximity we want our clients to be
our focus throughout the group and for the long term
under the leadership of our new global head of sales
robert jolliffe we have established a team of group
relationship managers you will find an interview with
 robert on page 32

client relationships are one part of the equation  client
focused solutions are the other they must go hand in hand
this is why we have centralised our product development
coordinated by ashwin kumar our new global head of prod
uct development he talks about his plans on page 18

we continue to focus on asia and especially china  one
of the worlds most important growth regions we founded
the china europe international exchange ceinex at the
end of october 2015 a europeanchinese cooperation that
is truly unique worldwide with which we are preparing for
the future

to ensure that accelerate is a success we realigned exec
utive board portfolios at the beginning of 2016 the goal
of all these steps is to act faster and in a more focused and
clientoriented manner

i hope you will enjoy reading our annual
yours sincerely

 what was the first impression you got                         tunities are going on within the group so one of the
 of deutsche börse group  and what had                        things i found was lacking when i first got here was
 been the first steps                                         penetration of the clients at a senior level what i have
                                                               done is to create a role of group relationship managers
 what i found when i first got here was that the sales         and i have hired five people so far and they are going
 force were siloed into their business units  and they      to work with our existing and our future client base on
 still are to a large extent we are trying to encourage the   a very high level actually at the c level that way we
 sales people to come out of those silos have a look          can build relationships from the top level down rather
 around like a meerkat and go back down into their silos      than just coming from the bottom level up which is the
 to do their day job where they are specialised sales          way we have been developing our relationships over the
 people but also to reach out and see what other oppor       past ten to fifteen years really

     do you think the market is re ally aware                        do you see a demand for products and
     of deutsche börse groups existing prod                        services that deutsche börse group
     uct and services portfolio                                     does not ye t cover


     the question really is is the market aware of deutsche         i feel that there needs to be a much higher influence of
     börse group itself because deutsche börse group is a           the sales input into the product development at deutsche
     conglomerate and it has various different very wellknown       börse and thats why i am very keen to work with
     product silos youve got for example eurex youve got       ashwin kumar because he understands the products
     clearstream two brands which are very well known to            and the products on the sales side need to be inter
     quite a lot of people particularly outside of germany         woven together from the starting point until the final
     who do not know that deutsche börse is part of those            delivery point as well
     organisations so the branding of deutsche börse group
     needs to be stretched wider because at the moment
     many clients just say oh yes eurex i know eurex           has there been a particul ar experience
     but they do not know that deutsche börse is the owner           which has impressed and motivated you
     of eurex it is the same with clearstream they know
     clearstream but they do not know that clearstream is            the most influential person in my life was a history
     married to deutsche börse to eurex to 360t etc             teacher when i was in school when i was 13 or 14
                                                                     years old i loved history as a subject and he taught

                                                                     time to constantly revise the status quo not accepting

                                                                     is the same in the work place to constantly revise how
                                                                     you are working if youve got best practices where
                                                                     are new influences and new ideas new ways of organ

we have greek customers both at clearstream and at           m inimisation and risk management 
eurex clearing for a long time we have not accepted
greek securities as collateral and the credit lines that    from a business perspective there are three risk m     an
we give to greek customers were in any event very            agement principles which we follow we want to under
limited and secured by collateral so the credit risk was    stand the risks that were taking we want to manage
effectively zero if the greek state had defaulted then     those risks efficiently and we want to make sure that
we would have had no credit loss there is very little       the relationship between risk and return is sufficient 
business risk because we dont earn a lot of revenue         that the return compensates for the risk that we take
from greek customers on the operational risk side          doing business you take risk but we want to see that
we had a task force at clearstream dealing with the          the risks are managed actively within our risk appetite

duced by the greek government and that was some            efficiently of course in certain essential parts of the
thing really new for all of us i think because the greek   market infrastructure particularly the clearing house
government was introducing new legislation overnight        we manage risks within a very tight risk appetite
and we were having to follow it together with the rest
of the market the next day that was very difficult
because the legislation was in greek nobody had ever
seen it before and somehow we had to interpret it in
the same way as our customers and avoid complaints                        info r mation t e chno l o g y
