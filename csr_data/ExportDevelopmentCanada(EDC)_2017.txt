taking accountability

message from the president and ceo
    g41

an important transformation is happening in the international
business community

organizations around the world have recognized the benefits of working together to
tackle global challenges like climate change corruption and social inclusion theres a
growing understanding that strong practices in corporate social responsibility csr
are no longer a nicetohave but are in fact the drivers of innovation contributing to a
sustainable and competitive business

for edc csr has been a strategic priority for some time from our perspective the work
we do to continuously improve our practices and to encourage responsible business
conduct is integral to our  and our customers  success our extensive csr policies and
practices are a big part of why we have such a strong reputation among our peers they
are also part of edcs value proposition not only for those with whom we do business
but also for our stakeholders and employees

as an organization that has developed a substantial csr strategy over the years its
our responsibility to continue pushing the envelope both internally and with our
partners in some countries where canadian companies conduct business there                     benoit daignault
can be challenges with low institutional support communities with little structure or             president and
government and other very complex environments for edc its important to be able            chief executive officer
to help canadian companies navigate these environments ensuring their success and
the success of the communities where they do business a company that is active in
a community in a positive way will ultimately be more successful and profitable in the
long term this is true whether you are operating in a small community in canada or in
a developing market overseas

our csr practices can  and do  set us apart from other financiers and they also
differentiate our customers and partners thats what were striving for to be a
differentiator for those with whom we do business when edc is part of a transaction we
want investors financiers customers and every other link in the supply chain to know that
best practices are being upheld this doesnt have to mean turning away transactions it
means being a force of positive influence for our customers and the many organizations
we work with and helping our customers to longer term business success

in 2016 we took steps towards this goal

we added new membership and knowhow to edcs csr advisory council now in its
16th year this highly skilled group acts as an unbiased source of advice and direction
its members provide expert insight and knowledge and help us sharpen our csr focus
in the past insight from the council has helped inform ideas such as the issuance of our
green bonds and updates to anticorruption due diligence over the last year especially
the role of the council has evolved and matured we are having deeper dialogues about
our strategy and how we can better support canadian businesses through our policies
and programs




                                                                                                            photo  martin lipman
6     edc 2016 corporate social responsibility report

taking accountability

message from the president and ceo
this was also the year that edc advanced our relationships with our many stakeholders
and improved our transparency we understand the impact our activities can have
on people everywhere we do business it is important that we remain connected with
those we touch and that we continue to work closely with them as we advance our csr
policies constructive feedback from our many stakeholders will be an important part of
our development

perhaps most central to this goal of keeping csr central to our business is our employee
base for csr to be part of our value proposition for our customers and our partners
it must also be part of our value proposition as an employer how we work within our
communities and how we conduct our business is an important part of recruiting and
retaining good talent and one of the reasons why edc is a top 100 employer

as we look to the future its leadership of this kind that we will continue to build on

the title of this report doing better together is a testament to the importance we place
on working with others to advance the cause of more responsible business practices
responsible business is good for business it is an essential element of how edc defines
success for the canadian companies we serve and the global leader in trade we need
canada to be

weve come a long way but are we where we need to be no not yet but thats why we
will continue this important work tomorrow

i want to thank our csr advisory council and board of directors for their guidance
and support in developing edcs strategy i would also like to thank edcs employees
for continuing to drive our culture of continuous improvement and sustainability this
work will help edc achieve its goal of going beyond our walls and using our influence to
advocate for better business practices and global solutions

sincerely

taking accountability

message from senior vicepresident

    g41

without a doubt 2016 will be remembered as the year for action on climate
change at edc our list of firsts and milestone achievements was lengthy

 implemented the oecd sector understanding on export credits for coalfired electricity
  generation projects limiting export credit support for new coalfired power plants cfpp
  six months ahead of the formal effective date

 supported 273 million in climate finance transactions this is the amount of support we
  provided for climatefriendly projects or companies operating in developing countries

 began a project to measure the carbon impact of edcs investment portfolio the results
  of which will be available in 2017

 reached the milestone of 1 billion in support for companies in the clean technology
  sector the culmination of several years of relationship building and assistance as well as
  a deep understanding of and expertise in the sector

 we expanded our expertise and resources in areas such as law engineering and
  anticorruption management this has formed a strong complement to a team with
  practical business experience creating a group that understands the challenges faced by          catherine decarie
  canadian businesses and the value of sustainable global business practices                      senior vicepresident
                                                                                                     corporate affairs
shortly after yearend we distinguished ourselves again by being the only export credit
agency to articulate and publicly disclose its position on cfpps edcs policy clarifies the
types of coal projects we will and will not support and is more rigorous than the sector
understanding itself

im extremely proud of what we accomplished in a relatively short period of time climate
change is creating a growing array of risks and concerns around the world through our
lending and investment activities edc is in a unique position to help facilitate the transition
to a more sustainable economy and we are stepping up in meaningful ways

growing csr contributions
our expanded csr team is making important contributions on many fronts both within
edc and on the global stage to advance responsible and sustainable business

one of our leaders is on the edc steering committee charged with articulating a more
robust approach to financial crimes under our broader enterprise risk management
framework another is working with our ceo and executive team to further integrate csr
into the organizations business processes and make it an integral part of the edc brand

edc is on the steering committee of the equator principles and many of our csr
team members are involved in working groups of the equator principles and the oecd
environmental practitioners helping tackle global issues and shape international standards
in the areas of climate biodiversity human rights and social risks through their efforts edc
played a role in strengthening the oecd common approaches guidance for export credit
agencies in addressing human rights risks

all of these activities point to a mature csr function thats ready willing and able to tackle
complex issues and drive change on a broad scale


                                                                                                               photo  martin lipman

message from senior vicepresident

among our other 2016 accomplishments we made inroads in addressing feedback
from civil society organizations csos about our level of transparency by involving our
customers in our responses to cso queries we were able to provide more details about
particular transactions and initiate constructive dialogue this is the beginning of a new
approach to engaging with csos that we will continue to evolve in 2017 even if sometimes
we have to agree to disagree

were also very proud of advances made in our approach to community investment
edc held its first community investment day inviting employees to take a day away from                for the fourth
the office to volunteer at a local charity close to 900 people almost 75 of edc staff            consecutive year
helped out at 26 different charities in communities across canada and in colombia india              edc was named
and mexico                                                                                            among the top

especially satisfying to see that more than 90 of respondents to our latest employee
engagement survey rated edc favourably for understanding and appreciating differences
                                                                                                        by corporate

we look forward to taking the next step in the evolution of csr at edc at the highest levels
of the organization we see it as central to our brand our longterm strategy and our ability
to help canadian businesses succeed internationally

a priority of our csr team will be to spend more time with customers and stakeholders
in the coming year and adopt an outsidein perspective thats more proactive than
reactive as mentioned with our external stakeholders we want to increase listening and
transparency with customers we aim to get involved at an earlier stage of the value chain
offering them csr expertise and services that help their business

stakeholder engagement
  g421 g424 g426 g427 g4dma product portfolio

government and civil society organizations csos  we frequently engage
with stakeholders in government and csos on topics of mutual concern transparency has
been a hot topic for csos and there has been criticism about our approach including the
following from our 2015 csr reporting cycle

edc uses client confidentiality too often as an excuse not to disclose information

edc may be doing a very good job screening for environmental and social risks and turning
down a lot of projects without our knowing in order for the public to have confidence they
should disclose more and provide information earlier in their review process                          learn more about our policies and
                                                                                                          approaches to transparency
weve since initiated a new process for addressing certain cso inquiries which involves our
customers see our listening and responding case study in addition transparency will
be the focus of our spring 2017 csr advisory council meeting and weve invited a diverse
range of stakeholders to the session to share their views on how edc can improve

small and mediumsized enterprises

small and mediumsized enterprises smes make up about 98 of canadas
businesses and account for 30 of gross domestic product gdp and over 70
of all jobs yet only 11 of smes canadas economic engine are tapping into
international customers and supply chains the health of the canadian economy
moving forward will depend on helping more smes grow through export

our approach
edc has made it a priority to help canadian smes grow internationally recognizing that smes
have fewer financial options than large corporations we use a broad definition of smes that
covers any company with annual sales under 50 million in recent years weve expanded
our reach across canada with additional sales and underwriting capacity to better serve
sme exporters where they do business

edc provides smes with financing solutions such as direct lending and loan guarantees
to financial institutions to encourage them to extend the financing an exporter may need
we also provide insurance products to protect against the risk of not getting paid by foreign
buyers as well as bonding and guarantee solutions

in addition edc leverages its financing relationships with foreign buyers to encourage the
purchase of canadian goods and services and to introduce smes into their global supply
chains through our matchmaking program we work closely with the trade commissioner
service tcs and global affairs canada at various types of events such as trade shows
inmarket visits and crosscanada visits to bring together groups of canadian companies
whose capabilities and expertise match specific foreign buyer needs

our corporate website and channels such as exportwiseca provide support and
education on getting ready to export and managing the risks we also promote sme export
success stories in local and international media

to track our efforts we count the number of smes supported each year and set annual
growth objectives

requirements the companys track record and corporate environmental and social risk
management policies and procedures and the companys commitments to csr initiatives
standards and guidelines among other aspects the outcome of the assessment is used
to advise edc business teams on the acceptability of the customers performance in
these areas

project reviews
requests for financial services that relate directly to projects are reviewed by our eas team
against the requirements of our erd and host country standards project reviews involve
benchmarking the undertaking to the ifc performance standards on environmental and
social sustainability the performance standards outline best practices and expectations for
project developers to avoid mitigate and manage risks and impacts and demonstrate that
they are doing business in a sustainable way

edcs review of projects is indepth and involved we require that projects provide
appropriate environmental and social impact assessments that meet the requirements of
the host country and align with the ifc performance standards

for category a projects and some category b projects the eas team visits the project
sites to better understand the operating context to see firsthand how the company is
implementing its environmental and social risk management programs and where possible
to engage directly with stakeholders key to this process is working with independent
reviewers and partner banks to ensure that appropriate technical expertise is brought to
the assessment to make certain that all issues are properly addressed

where gaps are identified edc works with the customer to find solutions which may
require engaging specialists to help develop additional mitigation measures edc and
partner lenders may go so far as to advise the appointment of independent panels to
provide expert advice to companies dealing with unique or complex issues in the areas
of biodiversity or community impacts

when edc is involved in projects the eas team works with our underwriting and business
teams to negotiate and structure environmental and social covenants action plans and
annual monitoring and reporting requirements in loan agreements

a key part of our process linked to commitments such as the equator principles is ongoing
monitoring of project performance once a loan agreement is signed the eas team requires
project sponsors to provide documentation demonstrating their ongoing commitment to
meeting national and international standards through monitoring reports independent
assessments or meetings the team often visits project sites to confirm that environmental
and social standards and commitments are being met throughout the life of the loan

while theres no onesizefitsall approach the basic practices kinross follows apply               as a company 
everywhere engage with stakeholders in a spirit of good faith and transparency                  their observations

there are clear signs of kinross positive impact in communities near its mines for example
in brazil longterm human development indicators show that since 1990 the city of
paracatu home to one of kinross larger mines has developed more rapidly than brazil on
average and is now above national averages for life span education poverty and infant and
maternal health

over the years edc has supported kinross through a letter of credit facility to cover
reclamation obligations for its us properties a revolving credit facility and term loan and
project financing for its kupol gold mine in russia which has since been repaid in full the
kupol project was reviewed under edcs environmental and social review directive erd

kinross works with many financial institutions and while the credit support provided by
edc is important whats even more significant is the endorsement of our practices by edc
adds ed opitz we know that edc would not partner with us if they found deficiencies in
how we approach our social and environmental responsibilities as well edc provides a
valuable thirdparty assessment of how were doing as a company  their observations
commentary and suggestions help us do our job better

 edc implemented the oecd sector understanding on export credits for coalfired electricity
  generation projects limiting export credit support for new coalfired power plants cfpps
  six months ahead of the formal january 1 2017 effective date

 further to the new sector understanding we developed our own policy on cfpps which
  is posted to our website the edc policy which took effect in january 2017 goes a step
  further than the sector understanding in defining the new and existing projects we will
  or will not support for existing cfpps edc will consider support on a casebycase basis
  provided that the support is for facility modernization resulting in lower co2 emissions

 we reported our annual climate finance volume to the government of canada for the
                                                                                                 working together
  first time in support of a wholeofgovernment effort in this regard this is the amount of   to tackle climate
  support we provided to climatefriendly projects or companies operating in developing             change
  countries the total for 2016 was 273 million

where were going
weve started to assess the carbon footprint of edcs investment portfolio and plan to
use the results which will be available in 2017 to determine how we can best support
the transition to a lowcarbon economy  for example by investing in more cleantech
companies helping existing customers switch to cleaner technologies or offering more
climate change products and services

              further strengthened our procedure for conducting routine human rights due diligence
              finetuned our system signalling when increased human rights due diligence is required  for example for
               transactions in pre and postconflict countries where the risks of severe human rights impacts may increase
              operationalized an internal committee to identify and evaluate human rights risks and impacts in higher
               risk scenarios provide guidance on emerging human rights issues or issues relevant to edc and develop
               measures to mitigate those risks

          edc continued to engage with peers in the area of human rights including attending the united nations forum
           on business and human rights the preeminent global gathering for human rights in business the connection
           between human rights and the world of finance was a key topic of the 2016 forum

          members of edcs environmental advisory services eas team participated in oecd practitioners meetings

our approach
edc employees are bound by the code of business ethics and the code of conduct the
codes all employees sign an annual statement confirming their compliance with the codes

our compliance and ethics group is responsible for establishing andor improving edcs
various compliance and ethics programs it is led by a chief compliance and ethics
officer who has an independent reporting line to a committee of the board of directors
the compliance group plays a role in six areas compliance risk management financial

listening and responding
we want to show our stakeholders that were listening to them and thinking about what we
can do to meet their expectations in a more comprehensive way says catherine decarie
senior vicepresident corporate affairs edc

weve started to alter our approach to engaging with civil society organizations csos
in response to feedback that we werent being open and transparent enough in our
transaction reporting our challenge has always been to provide sufficient detail to satisfy
cso interest while protecting customer confidentiality andor competitive information
in 2016 we took action on the matter heres how

from time to time edc receives written requests from csos questioning our support for
particular companies or transactions one request in 2016 sought details on our support
for an oil and gas company operating in colombia after an ngo published a report alleging
environmental and human rights violations in the colombian oil and gas sector

while edc could answer the questions related to our own social and environmental risk
review processes we couldnt answer every question related to our customer without
breaching our obligations rather than leaving it at that we involved our customer in the
process they willingly provided their own written answers to the questions raised which
were then included in our response to the cso we and our customer also offered to meet
with the cso to continue the dialogue

this was a first step toward increasing transparency and improving engagement practices
with csos the may 2017 meeting of edcs csr advisory council will focus on transparency
and what were trying to achieve weve invited a panel of stakeholders representing a wide
range of views to attend part of the session to speak to us about their expectations

corruption and bribery distort trade undermine the free flow of goods and
services and inhibit economic growth canada and other leading trading nations
have taken concerted action to fight corruption and edc has a strong role to
play in supporting their efforts

our approach
weve made a corporate commitment to zero tolerance for business obtained through
bribery or corruption

as a member state of the oecd canada has passed the corruption of foreign public officials
                                                                                                     we have
act which guides us edc is also a member of the oecd working party on export credits            zero tolerance
and credit guarantees and is bound by the oecd recommendation on bribery and officially           for business obtained through
supported export credits oecd recommendations                                                       bribery or corruption
                                                                                              click here to read our anticorruption
further to this our code of business ethics and our anticorruption policy guidelines                  policy guidelines
prohibit us from knowingly supporting a transaction involving the offer or the giving of
a bribe

edc underwriting and business development staff conduct corruption screening on
transactions enhanced due diligence is undertaken by a specialized team if screening
reveals potential concerns the team conducts document reviews online research and talks
to the company representatives to find out what theyve done to remedy the situation and
improve their anticorruption and compliance controls in most cases issues relate not to
our canadian customers but to their foreign buyers thirdparty entities or projects they
may be supplying

we created an anticorruption program to build awareness among employees and
customers of the international conventions and canadian laws addressing corruption
the program includes a requirement for customers to submit anticorruption declarations
andor accept relevant provisions in their contracts to help ensure that edc upholds
its commitments

awareness of corruption risks is low among canadian exporters and we devote significant
resources to educating them edcs president writes to all new customers to remind them
of their legal obligations and provide guidance we also offer compliance tools videos and
webinars and publish newsletter articles on exportwiseca

  oecd recommendations

 we partnered with transparency international ti to deliver several seminars including
  a corruption and bribery session at the annual prospectors  developers association
  of canada pdac convention the session consisted of a role play where an edc
  representative acted as the corporate compliance officer in a company that had been
  accused of corruption and three expert commentators from the legal profession a
  financial institution and forensic accounting provided advice the workshop was very
  well received and was replicated at another ti event in alberta

 we participated in initial discussions with global affairs canada and the oecd to review
  potential reinforcements to the oecd recommendations which were last updated in 2006

where were going
corruption has a potential impact on all companies large and small no matter where they
do business thats why combatting corruption in international business remains one of our
most significant challenges a top priority for 2017 will be the continued implementation of
our financial crimes and kyc program

were very proud that both our total carbon footprint and our carbon footprint per fulltime
equivalent fte employee have continued to shrink the carbon footprint per fte employee
reached a record low since we moved into our headquarters in 2011 key performance
drivers included the following

 we installed an optimized controlling unit in our information technology cooling chiller
  plant that reduced the chiller tower cooling unit workload by more than 50 lowering
  electricity consumption to 402197 kwh per year from approximately 995530

 natural gas consumption decreased as a result of work with our head office landlord
                                                                                                      edc head office started a
  manulife to implement new programs and finetune existing ones for example
  automatic timers were adjusted so that natural gas consumers can turn them on and off            rooftop garden
  as required                                                                                   thats available for use by employees

acting responsibly

operational footprint
 technology is helping steady our paper consumption  edc employees are using laptops
  tablets smart boards and the like instead of paper the amount of paper recycled rose
  due to our increased use of shredding mechanisms in place to deal with confidential
  information in adherence with our records management policy

 ground travel declined thanks to technology such as videoconferencing however air
  travel rose because of the opening of our singapore office and our winnipeg office
  move both of which required travel and a physical employee presence

 one of our employees came up with the idea of growing vegetables on the 18th floor
  terrace of our ottawa building alongside the existing plants and flowers with the
  landlords support she ordered small planters and planted cherry tomatoes cucumbers
  hot and bell peppers kale and herbs employees were invited to help themselves to the
  produce come summer

where were going
in 2017 well continue to focus on food waste diversion and recycling capture rates by
implementing recommendations from a 2016 study to make our waste receptacle system
more convenient intuitive and informative
