sustainability at siemens

megatrends  demographic change urbanization climate change and globalization
 are affecting and deﬁning lives and economies throughout the world these game
changing forces are shaping our business by creating new markets and opening up
valuable new opportunities yet they also harbor signiﬁcant risks that need careful
management alone a valuebased sustainabilitydriven company committed to
living its principles can minimize these risks and master these challenges to
optimally leverage emerging opportunities for its stakeholders

weve made the three areas of sustainable development 
         environment business and society 
         the cornerstone of all our activities
principles of sustainability
sustainability these days is a buzzword used in many different contexts with many
different connotations but what does it mean for a multinational company we at
siemens dont just talk about sustainability

acting responsibly for a successful future
in the area of the environment were providing innovative products and solutions
to improve both our own ecobalance and those of our customers and suppliers in
the area of business were focusing on longterm value creation and in the area of
society were fostering our own employees and striving to be good citizens in all
the communities in which we are active

although decisions in these areas are not always free of conﬂicting interests we
aim to make all them transparent and to ﬁnd the best solutions possible the
responsible use of natural resources targeted investments in futureoriented
technologies that support proﬁtable growth while offering customers competitive
advantages and a company ethic that goes beyond mere compliance with the law
and places integrity at the center of business operations  these are the factors
enabling us to drive sustainable development and to lay the basis for our companys
successful future
