topsil semiconductor materials as hereby reconfirms its continued support of
the un global compact in the below statement

united nations global compact
on behalf of topsil semiconductor materials as i hereby reconfirm       ence not only do they aid us save resources and mitigate business
our companys continued support of the ten principles of the unit       risks thereby making topsil stronger but they also contribute to
ed nations global compact in the areas of human rights labour           ultimately make our world a little bit greener
rights the environment and anticorruption we continuously
acknowledge our responsibility to balance the business interests of
our company with those of our external environment and commit            kind regards
to share our efforts and concerns with our main stakeholders

in this annual communication on progress we describe the actions
taken in the past year to improve our performance on csrrelated         kalle hvidt nielsen
matters as well as the goals set for 2015                               ceo

in 2014 our main focus was the closedown of our old facility in
denmark for a leaner and more resource efficient manufacture at
our new stateoftheart ultrapure silicon production site the new
plant is characterised by more ecofriendly equipment and solu
tions and hightech systems allow us to continually finetune our
use of resources to a much wider extent than before

for 2015 we plan to continue this finetuning work while specifical
ly in our polish plant we will persist our work on raising employee
awareness concerning resource minimisation we furthermore
expect to implement a whistle blower scheme for our entire organi
sation

it is our firm belief that our yearonyear targets and reporting help
us stay on track on our journey towards a more sustainable exist

                                                          is where silicon comes in

                                                          silicon is used in the electric components

     electric cars and hybrid vehicles are expected to
     become more common on the road in future
     however they can only run if their batteries are
     charged beforehand and it is only possible to
     shift to a higher or lower gear if the electricity
     supply is regulated

     silicon has good power control properties
     and may be used for energyefficient
     electricity supply and regulation silicon
     is used for example under the bonnet
     and in the charging stations used to
     charge the car

csr activities embedded in
our everyday business


in topsils view each csr activity must be an embedded part of       likewise our production managers are appointed overall respon
our daytoday business in order to obtain the maximum benefit      sible for employee safety including training this makes good
such approach fits nicely with topsils strategy in which one out   sense as most of their staff is operating machinery on a daily
spoken focus area is to increase our efficiency and output          basis

in support of this our production and technical managers for
instance consider resource minimisation part of their jobs this
becomes particularly relevant when purchasing new equipment or
when improving already installed mechanical and other systems
