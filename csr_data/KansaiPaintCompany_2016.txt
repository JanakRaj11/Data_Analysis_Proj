     ales mushiyoke clean repels insect pests

     background and issue addressed
     infectious disease prevention is
     an important social challenge
     it is unpleasant and annoying when spiders winged ants moths or other
     insects alight on walls kansai paint has developed ales mushiyoke clean
     a coating that repels insect pests when coated on room walls this product is
     expected to be effective in preventing infectious diseases


     a problemsolving initiative
     kansai paint has blended into a coating a pharmacological agent that repels
     midges termites and other insects this ingredient affects the nervous
     systems of insects that alight on coated room surfaces making it difficult
     for them to remain in the room


          many insect pest species after entering a room tend to
          spend more time on walls or the ceiling than flying
                                                                                                    heres why its effective
               an insect enters               the insect alights on a     the insect leaves the
                   a room                       wall or ceiling           wall or ceiling




                                                more time is spent at
                                                  rest than flying


          blending an insect repellent a pyrethroid agent into the coating wards off insects by     contact with the
          affecting the nervous systems causing discomfort of insects that alight on come into     insect repellent
          contact with coated room surfaces
