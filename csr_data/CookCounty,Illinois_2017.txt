                   as leader of the secondlargest county in the nation i have made the
                   environment a top priority thats why i created the cook county green
                   leadership team chaired by my chief of staff all the county offices
                   under the president are accountable to this team for their sustainability
                   work
                   county thinks big about sustainability i set a goal to reduce the countys
                   harmful greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 80 percent by the year
                   2050 as a meaningful way to fight climate change to this end weve
already invested in efficiency projects to reduce energy use in threequarters of the
countys buildings and i am proud to say we are ahead of our annual target toward the
2050 goal from 2010 through 2015 cook county achieved an actual decrease in ghg
emissions from building energy of 22 percent more than twice our annual target and
there is more to come we are reducing energy use at our suburban courthouses and
highway facilities alone by more than 50 percent

beyond our work on improving the
sustainability of our own county buildings
and operations we are also incorporating
sustainability into our planning and
programming for our residents everyone
benefits from sustainable practices and a
clean environment is good for economic
growth a strong transportation system is
one of the fundamental pieces of
sustainable economic development and
to that end we have produced cook
countys first long range transportation
plan in more than 70 years the plan
prioritizes transit and other alternative
modes of transportation making the regions reliance on transportation as an economic
driver one that is sustainable into the future we are also promoting sustainable
development through our brownfield assessment program by helping west suburban
communities get old manufacturing sites back on the tax rolls and generating jobs the
county also has one of the most progressive ordinances in the us to make sure building
materials from demolition are recycled or reused we have kept 900000 tons of material
out of landfills and put that material back into the economy which also creates jobs
installing clean energy infrastructure creates local jobs and makes communities more
desirable thats why the county is partnering on opportunities for community solar
energy many people rent live in apartments or cant afford a whole solar array yet they
should still be able to experience the benefits of solar energy after all its not just good for
air quality and health its also good for your pocketbook


thank you to the members of the green leadership team and all of the employees
working to maintain these efforts and continue to integrate sustainability into everything we
do at the county

sustainability in the community
community solar
cook county is making solar
energy more available and
affordable for all county
residents by working with
stakeholders to determine what
is needed for community solar
to develop here cook county
was one of 15 recipients
nationwide awarded funds from
the us department of energy
solar market pathways project
the county team  which includes elevate energy west monroe partners
environmental law and policy center the city of chicago and comed  has issued six
reports all available at httpswwwcookcountyilgovservicesolarenergy as the team
enters the second half of the project pilot sites will be selected for indepth financial and
engineering modeling to demonstrate the feasibility of community solar in cook county
across a range of project types


long range transportation plan
                                       between 2014 and 2016 the cook county
                                       department of transportation and highways worked
                                       with subject matter experts to develop the countys
                                       first long range transportation plan in more than 70
                                       years the plan connecting cook county was
                                       approved and adopted by the cook county board of
commissioners on august 3 2016 and highlights five transportation priorities prioritize
transit and other transportation alternatives support the regions role as north americas
freight capital promote equal access to opportunities maintain and modernize what
already exists and increase investments in transportation
cook county has more than half of the metropolitan areas population jobs businesses
and transportation facilities and is uniquely vested in the health and sustainability of our
region transportation accounts for 27 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in cook
county given that transit and alternative modes of transportation can significantly reduce
emissions associated with transportation cook countys focus on transit is critical to
making our region more sustainable for these same reasons  as well as the breadth and
depth of the countys engineering fundraising and legal expertise  cook county is also
uniquely positioned to play a leadership role in the transportation arena
connecting cook county is a call to action  a framework to promote strategic partnerships
and investments that strengthen our economy and lead to more livable communities

cook county government
in 2011 president preckwinkle appointed the countys first chief sustainability officer
with the guidance of the sustainability advisory council our goal is to institutionalize
efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas emissions
president preckwinkle set an ambitious goal to decrease the countys greenhouse gas
ghg emissions by 80 percent by 2050 the county began by tracking the emissions
created through building energy use  the largest source of ghg emissions for the
county in the past three years the county has collected data and established baselines
for energy use and for its vehicle fleet water and waste as the county continues to
improve its data sources we will include these additional ghg sources into our reporting
increasing our baseline and giving us a clear path towards ghg reduction strategies

2015 ghg emissions from county buildings
ghg emissions from county buildings have decreased 22 percent from the 2010
baseline year this is well ahead of the 10 percent reduction goal to stay on target
towards an 80 percent decrease in emissions by 2050
these reductions have been achieved through concentrated investments in energy
efficiency through guaranteed energy savings projects gesps at stroger hospital and
department of corrections campuses which were completed in 2015 further savings
will be realized at these buildings over the 20year life of the contracts additional
reductions are expected to be added in the coming years as the gesps at the countys
courthouses administration buildings and highway buildings are completed in 2016 and
2017




                                                                                       7

county building and dunne building
upgrades in these two buildings will reduce greenhouse gas emissions 31 percent
through reducing energy consumption by 30 percent and water consumption by 13
percent projects include lighting upgrades upgrades of the energy management
control systems water conservation measures and upgrades to chilled water hot
water and steam distribution systems


skokie bridgeview markham and rolling meadow courthouses
and highway maintenance facilities
by implementing led lighting upgrades replacing endoflife boilers and chillers
energy management controls systems upgrades window replacements and water
conservation measures the county will realize a 56 percent greenhouse gas
emission reduction and reduce energy consumption by 53 percent and water
consumption by 27 percent

demand response pilot
                                    cook county is participating in a pilot program to test and
                                    develop new ways to save energy
                                    the pilot project called combined capacity asset
                                    performance project is a collaboration with the
                                    environmental defense fund and pjm interconnection it
                                    will show how strategically combining resources can allow
                                    demand response a tool that pays customers to reduce
                                    electricity use in response to the grids needs
each year pjm manages a capacity auction to buy enough power supply resources to
meet the highest forecasted peak energy demand for the area it serves in pjms
wholesale power markets demand response resources compete directly with other forms
of energy thus demand response participants can bid into the auction offering the
amount of electricity they commit to reducing and receiving the same payments as power
companies to meet electricity needs currently 12 county buildings participate in the
emergency capacity demand response program and have committed to reducing a total of
57mw of electricity demand under pjms new performance requirements qualifying
sources of energy must respond any time there is a critical need previously demand
response users could choose to participate only during summer months


making the move to renewable energy
in order to decrease ghg emissions 80 percent by
2050 the county needs to make investments in
more than just energy efficiency there also needs
to be an investment in renewable energy generation
generating electricity from renewable energy rather
than fossil fuels also offers significant public health
benefits creating energy without air and water
pollution emitted by coal and natural gas plants the
guaranteed energy performance contracting               schaumburg department of transportation and

facilities will decrease the countys ghg emissions by 20000 tons co2e an average of
44 percent and include renewable energy installations such as solar photovoltaics and a
geothermal system when the installations of solar trees at markham and bridgeview
courthouses solar thermal walls at four department of transportation and highway
maintenance facilities districts 12 4 and 5 and a geothermal system at the skokie
courthouse are complete the county will have increased its renewable energy use by
over 128m kbtus annually
the geothermal system is a renewable form of energy that utilizes the earths natural
heating and cooling capacity in place of energy intensive mechanical heating and cooling
thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions

waste


as a part of the continued implementation of the cook county solid waste and recycling
plan the department of environmental control supports a number of efforts to increase
the return of materials to productive use through increased recycling efforts and
advocating for the safe disposal of harmful substances

electronic waste
            it has become increasingly difficult to legally recycle electronics despite a state
            mandate barring these materials from disposal in landfills due to a
            combination of plummeting commodity prices and the lack of a sustainable
            producer responsibility model in the state the cost of recycling these materials
            has become overwhelming for programs that previously provided such
services cook county continues to work with other county and municipal waste
management partners as well as the electronics industry to develop a sustainable model
for recycling these materials without going backwards and allowing for these often toxic
materials to be placed back into landfills

food scrap diversion
the county is also part of a growing effort to divert food
scraps from landfills along with construction and
demolition waste organic waste is one of the largest
components of the waste stream and contributes
greatly to the generation of greenhouse gases when
buried in a landfill as one of the founding members of
the illinois food scrap coalition the county supports
market and legislative efforts to divert additional food
scraps from landfills by returning these materials to the useful market by turning them into
nutrient rich compost or by generating energy through anaerobic digestion and biofuel
generation



in 2015 the cook county department of environmental control pursued the
recommendations of the solid waste management plan update by entering into a
delegation agreement with the illinois environmental protection agency for solid waste
inspection and enforcement authority of transfer stations landfills clean construction
and demolition fill operations open dumping and solid waste related complaints this
agreement led to a grant from the iepa to cover solid waste inspection costs by
investigating complaints locally environmental control is able to provide county
residents with faster response times and more frequent inspections




                                                                                            13
