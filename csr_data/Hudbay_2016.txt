from and endured every opportunity and challenge this industry can present between 2010 and
2015 we met the test of simultaneously developing what are now three outstanding mines today
our lowcost metals production and growth potential position us for continued success as a solid
investment and a reliable partner everywhere we operate

case study




maintaining safety and controlling costs in manitoba

in underground mines like hudbays reed operation in northern manitoba wiremesh
screens are bolted to the walls and ceiling to help prevent rock falls and caveins the
screens are held in place by plates attached by lengths of rebar mining activities like
underground blasting can lead to rocks falling or shifting behind the screens which causes
them to bend outward or bag to minimize bagging at reed the rebar securing the
plates is driven into the rock face in a pattern like the five side on a die its effective but
expensive with each length of rebar costing approximately c14 after thorough research
and testing miners at reed determined they could use a mechanical bolt instead of a
longer piece of rebar for the centre while still employing the five dice pattern that had
been so effective this one change will translate into annual savings of c180000 while
maintaining our high safety standards its a perfect example of continuous improvement
at work and has since been implemented at hudbays 777 mine as well

overall continuous improvement and cost optimization initiatives contributed to more
than c4 million in savings in 2015 while maintaining or improving our operating
standards additional savings of c15 million in the manitoba operations are planned in
2016

case study




constancia expands transport fleet in response to production
rampup and transportation challenges

through enviable performance the team at constancia ramped up to full production far
more quickly than anticipated during the same period the peru ministry of transportation
was carrying out a major construction program that closed off traffic for seven hours per
day on a 60kilometre section of the 470kilometre route from the mine to the port at
matarani consequently a backlog of copper concentrate built up at the site in the fall of
2015 to reduce the backlog a much larger fleet of trucks and drivers was needed to get
concentrate to the port transport companies across peru were contracted and a team of
contractors and subcontractors was soon assembled however it became clear that work
needed to be done to ensure that the new drivers understood and acted in accordance
with hudbays safety expectations

experienced instructors were hired to provide training verify skills and periodically assess
driver performance the drivers were educated in the principles of defensive driving
including selfmonitoring for fatigue and aggressive driving we added control points for
checking driver compliance and allowing drivers to rest if tired trucks were linked to a gps
monitoring system that tracked location as well as driving speed we also explored
alternative routes to bypass road construction but these secondary roads through the
andes proved unsuitable for the safe operation of transport trucks

although hudbay represented less than onethird of the heavy truck traffic on most of the
route more communities took notice of our operations particularly on the unpaved
sections of the route as the number of trips increased constancias community relations
team contacted local leaders held public meetings informed people about routes and
timing and explained measures put in place to mitigate the impact of increased traffic like
watering gravel roads to control dust

to provide further opportunities for local communities to benefit economically from our
move into operations we also worked with committees for development in uchucarco and
chilloroya to help them purchase 25 trucks which they could rent to contractors hauling
constancia concentrate to matarani

through our efforts to increase transportation capacity and safety all of the excess
concentrate inventory was moved to port and sold by the end of 2015



case study




arizona business unit builds ties with the community

hudbay has a lot of experience in building close ties with the communities near our mining
operations  weve been doing it for almost 100 years in 2014 we acquired the rosemont
project located in pima county arizona approximately 50 miles 80 kilometres
southwest of tucson rosemont has the potential to be one of the largest copper mines in
the us soon after the acquisition was completed the head of our arizona business unit
pat merrin moved to tucson with his family and worked to demonstrate that hudbay is
committed to building the right mine the right way and that good community relations
are an essential part of that vision

while rosemont is still in the permitting phase weve had a team on the ground for two
years and have hired local people for a number of key roles weve also put in place a
community relations cr strategic plan with a stated mission to build meaningful
relationships with stakeholders based on integrity and mutual respect our efforts in this
area range from detailed protocols for cr and government relations building local
relationships through engagement initiatives such as site tours implementing a robust
corporate contributions program and doing simple things like financially supporting and
taking part in local events

we hope to complete permitting in 2016 once the construction phase of the project is
initiated business unit lead pat merrin notes we need to build not just a profitable mine
but a good mine one that people respect trust and see as a valuable addition to their
community

our company
ceo
message
2015 was a year of transition and important growth accomplishments for hudbay in my first letter as
chief executive officer im pleased to report that 2015 was also a year that confirmed the strengths
of our strategy and our people

when hudbay successfully ramped up to full commercial production at constancia it completed the
transition from a company that had been focused on development to one focused on optimizing
production and processes at operating mines as we reported early this year copper sales volumes
from our mines  constancia lalor reed and 777  increased 850 yearoveryear in the fourth
quarter of 2015 this is a remarkable achievement by any measure and in any market conditions

experience managing the mining cycle
the impact of this strong performance was in stark contrast to the low price environment that
affected the entire commodity market at the same time it demonstrated why we focused on
bringing lalor and constancia in particular into production highquality longlife lowcost mines
enable hudbay to perform even in the tough times and position us to capitalize on opportunity
when as it always does the cycle follows its natural path to metal price increases




                                                 copper sales volumes from our mines 
                                                 constancia lalor reed and 777  increased
                                                 850 yearoveryear in the fourth quarter of
                                                 2015 this is a remarkable achievement by any
                                                 measure and in any market conditions




hudbay   2015 annual and csr report                                                                      7

in response to deteriorating commodity prices we launched an extensive review of all of our
operations as part of a companywide efficiency improvement initiative this review delivered
expected 2016 capital expenditure and operating cost reductions of more than 100 million
compared to 2016 guidance with no effect on our production guidance it is important to make clear
that pursuing and implementing these savings had no impact on safety safety is never negotiable

in early 2016 hudbay also announced amendments to our credit facility we received commitments
from lenders under our two secured credit facilities to consolidate the lender groups and restructure
the two facilities with more flexible financial covenants and longer maturity dates not only does our
success in this renegotiation enhance our liquidity position but it is also a clear indication that the
market recognizes hudbays strengths and it leaves us well positioned to respond to the current
price environment

meeting challenges
given the size location and complexity of the project the rampup to commercial production at
constancia went remarkably smoothly but inevitably there were challenges in fall 2015 driven in
part by strong rampup performance we experienced a buildup of copper concentrate inventory at
the mine site in response a larger fleet was quickly certified the range of routes to the port at
matarani optimized and by the end of 2015 the entire excess inventory had been transported to
port and sold

hudbay manitobas collective agreements with the seven unions expired on december 31 2014 we
were unable to establish an agreement with one union which subsequently went on strike in
may 2015 work proceeded under a contingency plan and a new threeyear collective agreement
was finalized in august 2015

our acquisition of the new britannia mine and mill nbm mill in may 2015 is an example of
imaginative nearterm cost control and strategic longterm thinking though it is currently on care
and maintenance the nbm mill can be refurbished more quickly and more costeffectively than
building a new concentrator as was initially planned for lalor at the same time it offers a range of
functionality that gives us considerable flexibility in processing copper and gold from lalor

mindful of our responsibilities
an organizationwide commitment to corporate social responsibility csr has been essential to the
achievements of the last five years and will help sustain hudbay through the ups and downs of the
commodity cycle at all times while taking steps to drive efficiency and optimize performance we
remain mindful of our responsibilities to our employees our communities and the environment csr
is very much like safety in this respect




hudbay   2015 annual and csr report                                                                        8

csr makes a key contribution to productivity and efficiency at all of our operations including our
2016 priorities to achieve iso 14001 environmental and ohsas 18001 health and safety
certification at constancia and to adopt the mining association of canadas towards sustainable
mining initiative the voluntary principles on security and human rights and other international best
practice standards

this past year we also strengthened our policies and procedures with respect to anticorruption and
took measurable steps to ensure they are widely understood throughout hudbay

as already mentioned safety remained our top priority our overall lost time accident lta
frequency was 03 per 200000 hours worked in 2015 while not on par with our record 2014
performance of 01 it was still a strong year for safety

connected to communities
building strong relationships with the communities near our operations is a defining characteristic of
hudbay and has been since its founding almost 90 years ago local residents must benefit from our
activities this includes hiring people from nearby communities to work at our operations which can
involve helping them upgrade their existing skills or teaching them new ones at constancia hudbay
peru employed more than 400 local people in 2015 and our manitoba subsidiary created 160 new
jobs primarily at lalor

along with providing employment we contribute to local development through the goods and
services we purchase from local businesses and through the taxes and royalties we pay on our
activities this year hudbay peru completed its first project under an innovative program that allows
companies to pay up to half their income tax through contributions to public infrastructure projects
these funds financed the building of an irrigation system in the district of livitaca

reflecting our commitment to openness and transparency we pursued community outreach
initiatives at all of our operations and projects keeping people informed of our activities and helping
them understand how they can engage and work with us this included particular efforts focused on
aboriginal communities near our operations where we continually work to build new relationships
and strengthen existing ties

we marked our longeststanding community relationship throughout 2015 by commemorating the
100th anniversary of the discovery of the flin flon deposit please visit the interactive centennial
museum on our website for a historic look at this milestone and its impact on our company and the
northern manitoba region




hudbay    2015 annual and csr report                                                                   9

a sustainable approach
hudbay is committed to mitigating impacts at its operations while contributing to regional
sustainability our efforts in manitoba include an ongoing commitment to boreal woodland caribou
conservation while in peru they include species rescue and relocation initiatives revegetation
programs using regionally appropriate seedlings grown by local community members and wetlands
management

environmental studies at rosemont in arizona have been ongoing for the last several years the data
from these studies has been used in developing management and mitigation plans that should help
to establish rosemont as a leader in environmental practice

a strong foundation
hudbay is guided by experience so in the current challenging market our focus will be on process
optimization and cost efficiency but experience also tells us there are few companies in the sector
as strongly positioned as hudbay to deliver longterm growth in performance and value

in 2016 rosemont copper company our arizona subsidiary will continue work on the rosemont
permitting process and feasibility study to position it as one of the best shovelready projects in the
industry ready to move forward when the economics for development improve at constancia even
after its first full year of commercial operation the potential of this highvalue longlife asset
continues to impress

the same is true in manitoba where the foundation provided at lalor ensures that we will continue
to operate in the region well beyond the 100th anniversary in 2015 of the discovery of the original
flin flon deposit despite our best efforts including the exploration of the war baby claim in 2015 in
a matter of years 777 will reach the end of its life as an operating mine a priority for hudbay in 2016
will be working with our colleagues and with the community in flin flon to help ensure a smooth and
effective social and economic transition at the same time i cannot overstate that our commitment
to manitoba remains strong and our connection to flin flon will endure

we intend to grow our company via exploration and development of projects already in our control
like rosemont while also keeping an eye on acquisition opportunities that fit our strategic criteria in
order to successfully achieve these initiatives we recognize the need to have strong operating and
management teams which is why we will continue to develop leadership programs to maintain
uniform high leadership capability within hudbay above all we value the safety and wellbeing of all
our employees and the communities where we operate and maintaining or improving our safety
performance and strong relationships with our local communities will remain top priorities for the
company

i would like to thank the board for the confidence they have shown in me and i want to thank my
colleagues throughout hudbay for the support they have extended to me in my new role the theme
of this years report is mining experience because it captures how hudbay benefits from a depth of
experience and a knowledge of mining that combine to give us a truly unique advantage

2015 and our priorities for the years ahead

                                banker focused on mining for over a decade i wanted to
                                specialize in something that canada excelled at and mining is
                                where canadian companies are the leaders in the world it was
                                the opportunity to be with companies that are growing
                                companies that matter that drew eugene to hudbay in 2014 he
          our success in
                                played a central role in hudbays acquisition of rosemont an asset

   country a new language      producers wed been tracking rosemont before i got here
  and a new type of mining     notes eugene but part of my experience as an investment banker
      helped give us the        was helping to identify the right time the right environment and
   confidence that we could     the right competitive situation for moving on rosemont
   do it here at rosemont     hudbays experience with constancia in peru also made an
         eugene lei             important contribution to the rosemont acquisition says eugene

business and financial review
strategy
at hudbay our mission is to create sustainable value for our stakeholders by acquiring developing
and operating highquality longlife deposits with exploration potential in miningfriendly
jurisdictions over the last five years we have worked toward this objective and in 2014 and 2015
our efforts culminated with the successful rampup of three new mines lalor reed and constancia
this achievement was tempered somewhat in that it occurred during a volatile price environment for
commodities

however this environment highlighted another defining strength of hudbay we have been mining
for close to 90 years and have a remarkable number of highly experienced people in all our
jurisdictions and at every level of our operations we know what it takes to deliver sustainable
sectorleading growth at a low cost

our strong asset base solid financial position and experienced team provide hudbay with a platform
for pursuing and implementing our strategy for growth we believe that the best way to create
stakeholder value in mining is to discover new mineral deposits and to develop facilities to profitably
extract ore from those deposits in 2016 and beyond we plan to grow hudbay through exploration
and development of properties we already control such as our rosemont project in arizona and
through the acquisition of other properties that meet our strategic criteria we will also continue to
optimize the value of our producing assets through efficient and safe operations

to help ensure that acquisitions we undertake always create sustainable value we have a number of
criteria for evaluating opportunities

  is the acquisition in a politically stable miningfriendly jurisdiction in the americas

  can we leverage our expertise in the exploration and development of volcanogenic massive
  sulphide and porphyry mineral deposits

  does the asset offer significant potential for exploration development and optimization

  at what stage of development is the asset because large mergers and acquisitions carry
  significant risks we focus on earlystage projects unless exceptional opportunities present
  themselves

  do we have a clear understanding of how hudbay can add value to a potential acquisition through
  our technical operational and project execution expertise or by providing needed financial capital
  or finding other optimization opportunities

  is the acquisition accretive to hudbay on a per share basis

 can we deliver environmental performance and achieve broad social acceptance


financial and business objectives for 2016

 focus on optimizing production and cost performance at our constancia and manitoba operations
 to ensure they remain cash flow positive

 work to advance the permitting process technical development and community and government
 relations at the rosemont project

 complete the planned 11000metre underground exploration of gold zones at lalor as well as
 the related tradeoff studies for mining and processing this gold mineralization phase 1 of a
 drilling program which included 14 holes was completed in 2015 and assay results confirmed a
 highgrade thick core down the middle of the main zone

 maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure hudbay remains well capitalized in an uncertain price
 environment

 continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria and pursue those that are in
 the best interest of hudbay and our stakeholders

business and financial review
operations
2015 was a transitional year for hudbay the successful rampup of our new mines supported a shift
in focus from advancing development to delivering production backed by nearly 90 years of
experience we were able to provide sectorleading growth in lowcost copper and zinc production
we also took action to further optimize our mine operations enhance our liquidity status and
achieve sustainable cost reductions in 2015 our experience our strategy and the strong
performance of our mines combined to ensure that hudbay is well positioned to weather the current
commodity price environment


2015 performance highlights

  launched a hudbaywide efficiency improvement initiative this ongoing review combined with
  cost containment efforts resulted in expected 2016 capital expenditure and operating cost
  reductions of more than 100 million with no impact on our 2016 production expectations

  ratified new threeyear agreements which provide enhancements to wage rates pensions and
  benefits with all seven labour unions representing employees at hudbays manitoba business
  unit

  resolved an inventory backlog at our constancia operation by increasing the size of our trucking
  fleet and expanding and optimizing our routes to the port of matarani see the constancia case
  study to learn more

  acquired the new britannia mine and mill nbm located in snow lake manitoba for
  approximately 11 million in net cash consideration plus a contingent payment of 5 million
  currently on care and maintenance the nbm mill if refurbished can potentially process
  approximately 2000 tonnes per day of gold zone ore from lalor a technical study on restarting
  the nbm mill is currently underway and as a result of the acquisition hudbay no longer
  anticipates constructing a new concentrator at lalor

  achieved fullyear production guidance and met or came in below cost guidance at all operations


manitoba

  in 2015 production of all metals increased compared to 2014 as a result of increased production
  at lalor and increased copper grades at reed production of all metals and unit operating costs
  were within our guidance ranges




hudbay    2015 annual and csr report                                                                 27

   ore production was 9 higher than in 2014 as a result of increased production at our lalor and
   reed mines which achieved commercial production in 2014 this was partially offset by lower
   production at our 777 mine as a result of equipment availability in the second and third quarters of
   2015

   copper and silver grades were lower than in 2014 by 2 and 10 respectively and zinc and gold
   grades were higher by 11 and 4 respectively

   constancia achieved commercial production in the second quarter of 2015 and subsequently
   ramped up to full production in the latter half of the year over the course of the year the peru
   operations produced 105897 tonnes of copper concentrate and 47263 ounces of precious metals
   in concentrate production was within our guidance range for 2015

   throughout 2015 optimization of plant performance was an important focus as onsite teams
   became increasingly familiar with operating the mine and with varying ore types a key challenge
   for the year was managing shipping and inventory issues in may and june shipments from the
   constancia mine to the port of matarani were constrained by a number of factors including truck
   availability protests unrelated to hudbay on portions of the trucking route and road repair
   activities that increased cycle times for concentrate trucks as a result of these constraints and a
   faster rampup to full production than anticipated an excess inventory of copper concentrate
   began building up at the mine mine management addressed these issues in several ways
   including by expanding the size of the mines trucking fleet by yearend inventory was back to
   normal working levels see the constancia case study to learn more

   looking to 2016 expansion of the port of matarani is near completion with the new pier f starting
   to handle concentrate shipments in february this new facility is intended to alleviate port
   congestion as other mines ramp up production

precautionary approach

hudbay operates under the precautionary principle through the life of a mine that is the duty to
prevent harm when it is within our power to do so working with a balance of probabilities if a
scientific conclusion is not yet available we use baseline environmental and social impact studies to
evaluate how to avoid mitigate or control potentially significant impacts implement appropriate
monitoring and management systems and address the need for mine closure in all cases provision
is made for public consultation and input

csr approach
human rights and
security
upholding human rights is fundamental to sustainable development  and to the success of our
business our human rights policy spells out our commitment to human rights setting
internationally accepted standards for business and labour practices community participation and
security measures

in keeping with our policy we also follow the voluntary principles on security and human rights an
operating framework that ensures security practices include respect for human rights our approach
is rooted in the belief that security begins with our relationships with neighbouring communities and
the professional conduct of our employees and security contractors

our business units train security personnel on the united nations un code of conduct for law
enforcement officials and the un basic principles on the use of force and firearms by law
enforcement officials particularly in peru the training is provided to company employees as well as
contractors and public security who are onsite at our request security supervisors and the majority
of contracted security staff are unarmed except for governmentmandated armed security guards at
the two explosive storage areas in peru

in peru we regularly audit security policies and practices and conduct gap analyses against the
voluntary principles security personnel work closely with constancias community relations team to
maintain open lines of communication with local communities and mitigate potential issues

hudbay is named in three civil lawsuits relating to events prior to 2010 in guatemala where the
company once owned a controlling interest in compañía guatemalteca de níquel cgn and its fenix

2015 performance highlights


peru

  following the 2014 occupation of the constancia property by members of a neighbouring
  community and its incidentfree resolution we conducted a thorough security review that
  included interviews with security personnel and community leaders findings were shared at
  employee and security staff workshops so that everyone could learn from the incident and know
  what is expected of them

 we also engaged an ngo to audit constancias security practices against the voluntary principles
 the audit revealed opportunities for improvement and our peru team is evaluating the followup
 actions to be taken two beneficial outcomes of this process have been enhanced social and
 human rights risk assessment and expanding engagement on security topics

 the constancia community relations and security teams initiated meetings with their peers at
 other mining companies in the area to collaborate on security approaches and discuss social unrest
 affecting other mining projects

 our constancia security manager coordinated a series of monthly meetings of mining security
 managers in southern peru the group invited guest speakers from the peruvian police force and
 local ngos to share best practices including their experiences with the voluntary principles on
 security and human rights


arizona

 the rosemont property is within 50 miles 80 kilometres of the mexican border and we are in
 regular communication with various federal state and local law enforcement agencies including
 the us border patrol fbi usda forest service az department of safety pima county sheriff and
 local ems to ensure adequate protection for hudbay workers and assets three meetings were
 held in 2015 and the decision was made to hold these meetings monthly in 2016

 in the fall of 2015 we deemed it necessary to close public access to certain areas of private land
 on our property because of increasing safety hazards related to shafts and sinkholes from historic
 mining activities


manitoba

 in addition to increased management oversight we hired a thirdparty security management team
 at our operations during the 118day labour strike this was both to protect assets and nonstriking
 workers and to provide a security resource during this period employees were required to show
 their company identification card to access our properties

csr approach
stakeholder engagement
stakeholder engagement is about connecting with people and organizations that can impact or be
impacted by our business such as investors employees communities and government we want to
listen communicate and integrate stakeholders voices into our plans each business unit is expected
to put in place engagement practices that are consistent with hudbays objectives while reflecting
the local context

our corporate stakeholder engagement and community response standards and guidance
documents provide clear direction on our expectations by implementing these standards at each
site we aim to build trust strengthen relationships reduce social risk and improve opportunities to
create value for the company and stakeholders

typical site processes and activities are as follows

materiality
once every three years we conduct a combined materiality hazard and aspect assessment to guide
our csr reporting and management priorities the assessment considers the environment health
safety and community ehsc issues that are most significant to hudbay in terms of business impact
and the degree of stakeholder interest

our last assessment was conducted in 2014 please see our 2014 report to learn more about our
process

boundaries

the materiality review was conducted on the initial boundary assumption of activities and facilities
within hudbays management control as described in the our company section of this report
participants in the review process were then asked for cases in which boundary limits should be
adjusted for specific aspects the exceptions that were agreed to be appropriate based on
stakeholder expectations and business risk are as follows

  safety statistics are tracked and reported for all contractor activities that are under hudbay
  contracts and supervision

  environmental incidents related to transportation between hudbay locations and local supplier
  activities are generally tracked and reviewed by hudbay but are not included in performance
  reporting in this report

  grievances are accepted and investigated with respect to local contractors and are included in
  grievance numbers and characterization in this report and

  scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated and reported

csr approach
supply chain stewardship
mining is the first stage of a vast supply chain that transforms the earths mineral resources into
products that meet vital needs in every aspect of life we focus our supply chain stewardship efforts
on the activities where we can have the greatest influence  namely our own operations contractors
working at our sites local suppliers and hudbay products up to the point at which they have been
delivered to customers

operations
all employees and contractors working at our sites are expected to meet the companys
environmental health and safety and human rights standards as described throughout this report

suppliers
the direct supply chain for our copper concentrate and zinc metal products originates in hudbays
own mines in northern manitoba and peru with the exception of some purchased zinc concentrate
that augments hudbays production as feed to our zinc metallurgical facility1

the indirect supply chain for energy goods and services used in transforming ore and concentrate
into products includes thousands of suppliers this supply chain includes operating supplies
maintenance supplies energy and fuels as well as capital goods

  in peru our supply chain in 2015 was related to the capital investment and operation of our
  constancia project ranging from engineering and construction services to mine haulage
  equipment and the grinding mills installed in the process plant our top 50 suppliers accounted for
  91 of our spending and 93 of our spending in 2015 was with suppliers based in peru

  in manitoba our supplier base relates to production operations and capital projects our top 50
  suppliers represented 75 of our spending in 2015 and 92 of spending was with suppliers in
  canada with another 7 of spending with suppliers based in other organisation for economic
  cooperation and development oecd countries these suppliers provided goods and services
  including engineering services electricity spare parts for equipment and capital equipment such
  as new underground haul trucks

we believe that our greater stewardship responsibility is at the local supply level because our
influence is much greater with small local suppliers our major international suppliers have their own
internal requirements and government regulations to comply with and much of our procurement is
in countries with robust environmental health and safety and human rights regulation

we therefore focus our supply chain sustainability efforts on encouraging and supporting local
suppliers in fulfilling their social responsibilities often working with them to establish appropriate
health and safety environmental or quality systems and processes

products
our two main products copper concentrate and zinc metal come from our own mines in canada and
peru and from purchased zinc concentrate

  34 of copper concentrate was sold to smelters in the americas and europe and 66 to smelters
  in asia from there several stages of melting and purifying the copper content ultimately result in
  9999 pure copper which provides the building block for many of lifes essentials

  we ship cast zinc metal produced at our flin flon zinc plant by rail and truck to industrial
  customers primarily galvanizers who use it to protect steel from corrosion throughout north
  america

hudbay products are conflictfree minerals under applicable regulatory requirements meaning that
they are not produced in regions of armed conflict or human rights abuses




hudbay   2015 annual and csr report                                                                       47

copper and zinc products are accompanied by material safety data sheets that provide details on
product composition toxicology handling storage and exposure issues we also meet our product
stewardship commitments by collaborating with governments and industry associations such as the
international zinc association

the international maritime organization imo has established new hazard classification criteria for
bulk cargoes the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol has
imposed restrictions on the disposal of bulk cargo residues which have been classified as harmful to
the marine environment hme under the amended annex v of the marpol convention

hudbay engaged the european copper institute eci to determine the marpol classification for
constancias copper concentrates and the eci has concluded it is not hme hudbay intends to have
its flin flon copper concentrates analyzed and classified in 2016
1 purchased concentrate represents 105 of the feed to the zinc metallurgical plant and is 100 sourced from canada



more on
supply chain stewardship

the minerals we mine play a fundamental role in the everyday lives of billions of people around the
world here are some interesting facts and figures from the copper development association and
the international zinc association

   copper is the standard benchmark for electrical conductivity it conducts electrical current better
   than any other metal except silver

   building construction accounts for nearly half of all copper use about 200 kilograms 439 pounds
   of copper is used in the average singlefamily north american home primarily for building wire
   and plumbing tube fittings and valves

   about 23 kilograms 50 pounds of copper and 18 kilograms 39 pounds of zinc can be found in
   the average car

   about 60 of zinc is used for galvanizing to protect steel from corrosion

   zinc is called the great protector because it is used to protect metals galvanizing as well as
   humans in products such as sunscreen zinc oxide zinc lozenges and vitamins

our people
health and
safety
a culture of zero harm is our first priority we consider it essential that employees and contractors at
our sites have the knowledge skills and equipment needed to perform their jobs safely  and the
support of management and coworkers to approach each task the right way

within two years of startup operations are required to be certified to the ohsas 18001 health and
safety management standard in manitoba external evaluators perform semiannual audits to
confirm ongoing compliance we also follow the mining association of canadas towards sustainable
mining tsm health and safety protocols at operating sites within and outside of canada internal
assessments against the tsm protocols are performed annually and thirdparty verification takes
place once every three years

an integrated management software system supports the process of recording investigating and
tracking all types of incidents and nonconformances across the company since its implementation
in 2014 the system has enabled us to conduct more rigorous reviews of highpotential safety risks
and put in place appropriate controls

the positive attitude safety system pass is an important program for driving performance in
manitoba pass is based on facilitated discussions at all levels of the organization to increase each
persons involvement in recognizing and managing workplace risks pass includes activities like
safety huddles at the start of each shift a logs for recording crews safety fixes and improvements
the rating of safe days and monthly pass newsletters its success is due in part to its strong
emphasis on positive reinforcement

at operating sites we maintain programs aimed at promoting and maintaining employee health and
wellness for example in manitoba the programs include

  fibrogenic dust screening conducted at least twice a year

  hearing surveillance tested at least annually and

  biological monitoring for workers who may be exposed to lead cadmium or arsenic as part of their
  work at the time of obtaining biological monitoring samples employees are also counselled on
  proper respirator fit and use personal hygiene working and eating habits smoking alcohol and
  drug intake and potential sources of metals exposures outside of the workplace

constancia is a remote site and many workers travel long distances to work eight or 14day rotation
shifts they remain onsite during their shift rotation staying at companyprovided accommodation
there are a variety of health and wellness services and amenities available to them at the camp
including a medical centre a soccer field and a volleyball court constancia employees are offered
massage therapy and chiropractor services semiannually we also host our own olympic games
which include chess and table tennis competitions

wellness programs run by employee wellness committees have been launched at each location the
programs include lunch and learns walking competitions newsletter articles and targeted campaigns
for common topics like cold and flu allergy awareness and managing stress your health matters here
is a place on the corporate intranet for employees to share health and wellness information and to

corporate

  our lost time accident lta frequency was 03 per 200000 hours worked compared to 01 in the
  previous year lost time accident severity which reflects the number of days missed was 114
  versus 47 in 2014 while performance was not at our record 2014 level it was still a strong year
  for safety the major difference was in the increased number of ltas in the first half of the year at
  constancia which combined with fewer hours worked about half of the previous year resulted
  in the significant increase in lta frequency

 safety performance was bolstered by a number of new processes and a strong emphasis on
 potentially serious incidents
   we introduced the incident cause analysis method icam for investigating incidents and near
   misses icam helps determine root causes so that appropriate action can be taken twentyfour
   icam investigators were trained including management and union members

   department heads held regular safety standdowns with their crews to discuss pressing safety
   issues incidents or trends

   the metallurgical surface departments introduced the take five safety card system in a
   process similar to the fivepoint safety card system used in the underground mines workers
   identify hazards on a take five card before starting a new activity the system is credited with
   helping drive noticeable improvement in the safety performance of the zinc plant and flin flon
   mill


peru

 the start of 2015 brought substantial change to the peru team with the transition from a
 construction project to operations safety performance slipped in the first half of the year and
 included two serious close calls which prompted an increased focus on safety controls procedures
 and communications through a series of safety talks we reinforced basics like prework job safety
 analyses to help nurture a safety culture the peru management team also mandated weekly
 safety audits conducted by department heads and started weekly onehour safety chats with
 supervisors and contractors these actions contributed to noticeable improvement in the second
 half of the year

 we also had to address transportation safety issues related to the large number of trucks hauling
 concentrate from the mine to the port at matarani see the constancia case study to learn more

 despite the significant drilling campaign there was only one reportable incident in 2015 related

  28 million in charitable donations and voluntary community investments

in 2015 our net payment to governments related to our projects and mining operations other than
municipal taxes and grants was a net credit of 341 million in both canada and peru government
tax policies create incentives for investments in new mines by reducing tax obligations while the
capital investment is recovered as a result of hudbays substantial investments in the constancia
lalor and reed mines as well as lower market prices for the metals we produce our income and
mining tax payments to government are relatively low in addition during 2015 we received refunds
from the peruvian government of valueadded tax paid on construction expenditures on the
constancia project

hudbay is a supporting company of the extractive industries transparency initiative eiti in its
efforts to establish a global standard for transparency regarding the host country governance of
natural resources and full disclosure of government revenues from its extractive sector our peruvian
subsidiary hudbay peru sac as a member of the peruvian mining society is supporting the eiti
process in peru

exploration and mining associations and civil society organizations that promoted the need for
canada to adopt such a standard and developed a set of recommendations to provide canadian
federal and provincial governments with a blueprint for a government payment reporting framework
that would serve the needs of both the datas endusers such as citizens governments and
investors and the reporting companies estma is largely consistent with the recommendations of
the rrtwg and in 2015 the industry and civil society members of the group were heavily engaged
with the government of canada on the development of guidance that will support companies
disclosure obligations

community development
mining done right can be a catalyst for positive change we make strong efforts to leverage our
capabilities and resources to advance the sustainable development of communities near our
operations and create conditions in which our business and our neighbours can flourish

hudbays community development efforts focus on

  helping communities build capacity to ensure sustained prosperity

  supporting community efforts to improve the quality of the natural environment and

  contributing to social cohesion and community spirit

when we enter a region we engage with the communities to understand their social and economic
development needs and priorities from there we seek to create employment and business
opportunities for local people and we work with the communities to develop programs focused on
delivering lasting benefits

in peru we made specific commitments to invest in health education and social development as part
of the land use agreements with the communities of uchucarco and chilloroya multisectorial
committees for development cmd comprising hudbay and community representatives approve
and oversee the projects being carried out using the proceeds of the agreements

in addition we signed cooperation agreements with communities in our indirect areas of influence
which spell out social development projects that we will work on together within a specified
voluntary budget provided by hudbay we engage with different levels of government and seek out
development projects that can be implemented as publicprivate partnerships our technical
assistance office also acts as a lobby group for local municipalities helping them qualify for public
and private funding of public investment projects

in canada hudbays first mine gave rise to the towns of flin flon and creighton and we remain an
integral part of the social and economic fabric of the region today we prioritize educational support
and training as a means of strengthening community capacity and building a local talent pool
available to hudbay and other employers we are a primary supporter of the northern manitoba
mining academy and we have strong affiliations with local universities colleges and high schools

while the lalor mine resources and exploration potential provide a foundation that ensures we will
continue to operate in the region well beyond the 100th anniversary of the discovery of the first
deposit in a matter of years 777 will reach the end of its life as an operating mine while our efforts
to find additional resources including the exploration of the war baby claim in 2015 have not been

local hiring
and skills development
local hiring and skills development can generate significant economic benefits for the communities
near our operations and is often identified as a high priority for stakeholders we know from
experience that we benefit too because it builds our talent pipeline and strengthens community and
employee relationships

in manitoba we are a member of the northern manitoba sector council nmsc and we partner
with the nmsc workplace education manitoba wem university college of the north ucn
workplace essential skills training west centre and first nations communities on training to
support first steps in mining career paths we recruit local job candidates through community
meetings and relationship building and we provide basic industry and mining skills training so that
candidates can succeed in their roles once they join hudbay hudbay is also a strong supporter of the
northern manitoba mining academy

in peru we have hired approximately 2900 people in total from the surrounding communities
primarily from the rural communities of uchucarco and chilloroya in 2015 local employment was
reduced to 400 people as construction ramped down and hudbay worked with local communities to
help people transition to other livelihoods we continue to prioritize local hiring and look for
opportunities to build the talent pool to this end we have partnerships with local technical
institutes for semiskilled trades and heavy equipment training the intent is to help local people
acquire skills through hudbaysponsored training programs and onthejob experience so that they
can apply for future jobs with our company or others in the region

in arizona there is a wealth of mining skills in the area near the rosemont project which we are
drawing on as the project progresses we also want to help build the local talent pool we have a
longstanding relationship with the department of natural resources at the university of arizona
through funding and a field laboratory that gives students an opportunity to perform work at our
onsite test plots the program has resulted in a number of masters degrees theses and papers
helping equip students with the credentials they need for their future careers we are in discussion
to create a mining industry channel for high school students through the local joint technical
education district jted jteds offer career and technical education programs to public high school
students up to age 22

 in hospitality jobs at the camp fortythree local people completed technical training funded by
 hudbay and now work in advanced jobs operating heavy equipment or providing technical
 assistance in the processing plant

 as part of our new recent graduate trainee program 11 engineers and 15 technicians are
 participating in a rotational program which gives them the opportunity to work in different parts
 of the processing plant during the oneyear period they receive full pay and benefits we hope to
 hire them permanently at the end of the year

 we awarded several grants to local schools for science technology engineering environment
 agriculture and mathematics what we call steeam initiatives including 5000 to the rising
 school for a robotics program 5000 to continental school district for a math intervention
 program 5000 to pima county jted to develop a laboratory for agriscience and vet science and
 5000 to walden grove high school to install smart boards in advanced placement ap math and
 science classrooms

 we participated in the 4h junior livestock auctions which provided nearly 20000 in scholarship
 funds to science programs for high school students in two counties near the project site

 four interns from san miguel high school worked at the hudbay arizona business unit offices the
 high school is located on tucsons economically disadvantaged south side students take a full
 college preparatory course load while simultaneously holding internships in corporations and
 earning nearly 40 of their school tuition

manitoba

 we revised our first nations training to employment process to address shortcomings identified in
 the 2014 program a joint initiative of hudbay local first nations communities and government
 agencies the process is aimed at helping people gain the skills needed for work at hudbay our
 team is now involved earlier in the process screening and interviewing candidates before they start
 any of the training programs we expect this new approach will lead to more people meeting
 hudbays essential skills requirements and being hired once they complete the training

 other first nations employment and training activities included
   presenting hudbay job opportunities and hiring processes to women at the saskatchewan indian
   institute of technologies  creighton work prep centre attendees included aboriginal women
   who had just completed a 16week carpentry course and welding students from northland
   college

social impact
local
purchasing
spending on local goods and services is one of the ways in which we contribute to the sustainability
of our host communities it leads to more local jobs and income transfers skills and technology and
helps create vital domestic business networks importantly to us local purchasing can also lower
costs in the long run and contribute to our social licence to operate

hudbays approach to local purchasing is guided by five principles mutual benefit fairness
competitiveness and transparency targeted capacity development informed and integrated
decisionmaking and collaboration with community representatives and available supporting
organizations

in peru we are honouring commitments to give first consideration to local suppliers for services such
as equipment rental and catering as set out in the life of mine community agreements we also help
them register their business and formalize quality standards and procedures so they can qualify for
potential business opportunities with other companies and we work with them on sales and
marketing strategies

in manitoba we have longstanding relationships with local transportation and construction
contractors we work closely with these suppliers often helping them establish systems and
processes to fulfill their social and environmental responsibilities


2015 performance highlights


corporate

  we finalized a corporate local procurement and employment lpe standard aimed at ensuring
  that at each site we actively identify opportunities for supporting and utilizing local workforce
  skills and business capacity to provide goods and services include lpe when negotiating
  community agreements and integrate lpe into ongoing business processes

 our exploration team met with the opaskwayak cree nation ocn nakow mining and supply
 company to discuss possible partnerships in the area of early exploration this type of partnership
 has worked for us before and we presented an overview of geophysical activities challenges and
 risks


arizona

 in preparation for when our permits are received we created an online contractor and vendor
 management system accessible from our corporate website the system allows contractors
 vendors and suppliers to identify themselves and their capabilities so they can be considered for
 future work

 we also met with local unions contractor groups and government representatives to inform them
 of potential future business opportunities


peru

 about 60 of the contractors working at constancia are from local communities most are focused
 on trucking and hospitality total purchases from local enterprises were 259 million

 in 2015 we worked with the cmds community development committees in uchucarco and
 chilloroya to buy 25 trucks that they could rent to local contractors to transport constancia
 concentrate to the port of matarani

social impact
community relations
as with any mining company hudbays presence can create both opportunities and concern for local
residents and indigenous people engaging with these communities in an open and inclusive way is
vital for earning our social licence to operate we must address their concerns about mining and
competing land use priorities and demonstrate how our operations can provide meaningful
longterm benefits above all we must maintain respect trust and understanding

each business unit conducts its own stakeholder analysis and implements a stakeholder engagement
plan to build relationships understand local concerns and respond to them this requirement is
documented in our stakeholder engagement standard we also formalized a companywide
community response standard also known as a grievance process to ensure complaints can be
signaled and then appropriately documented investigated and addressed


manitoba

in manitoba we engage regularly with the flin flon and snow lake communities recent discussions
have focused on training and job opportunities for the people of northern manitoba the impact of
the lalor mine on the town of snow lake and engagement with first nations communities

we place particular emphasis on engagement with first nations communities locally the
communities nearest hudbay are opaskwayak cree nation mosakahiken cree nation and mathias
colomb cree nation in manitoba and three communities in saskatchewan that are part of the peter
ballantyne cree nation through meetings school presentations mine tours open houses and
working together on joint initiatives usually related to employment we seek to improve
understanding of one another and build constructive relationships hudbays fulltime aboriginal
liaison officer coordinates our efforts and facilitates dialogue in addition the vice president of our
manitoba business unit cochairs the ministers mining advisory council which brings together first
nations leadership industry representatives and the government of manitoba to ensure first
nations communities benefit from the development of new mines

we have a court injunction preventing members of mathias colomb cree nation mccn from
blocking access to our sites as a result of blockades they staged at the lalor site in 2013 hudbay is
only seeking free access for employees and contractors to our sites the injunction is not a lawsuit
and it does not prohibit members of mccn or other communities or community companies from
bidding on hudbay contracts or seeking employment we recognize it as an ongoing relationship
challenge which makes it difficult for the community to fully realize the benefits and opportunities
that our operations can offer and we are seeking a path to restore our collaboration with mccn

peru

in peru there are two communities within our direct area of influence  uchucarco and chilloroya
both signed life of mine land use agreements with hudbay in exchange for portions of their
communityowned land we maintain community relations offices in both communities and engage
frequently with residents on a wide range of topics most often related to fulfilling commitments
under the agreements

we have signed cooperation agreements with a number of communities within our indirect area of
influence under these agreements we commit to working together on social development projects
within a specified budget provided by hudbay in 2015 we began building relationships with
communities along the route from constancia to the port of matarani where we transport
concentrate see details below


arizona

the rosemont site is close to a major urban area since acquiring this project in 2014 we have
worked to both understand the aggregate views of local stakeholders and engage directly with the
individuals and groups most interested in and connected to the project we believe that a robust
permitting process contributes to the development of worldclass mines and it is in that spirit that
we are engaging in the regulatory process to secure the final permits needed to advance the
rosemont project

 confirmatory drilling programs taking place at the site they sent letters to people within two
 miles of the site visited the homes of our closest neighbours spoke to community and
 government leaders and gave contact cards to all workers so they could direct any questions to
 the appropriate hudbay contacts

 in developing relationships with native american tribes in the region we have sought to share and
 build on our experiences in relationship building with first nations in manitoba cultural sensitivity
 training is included in the rosemont environmental impact statement and we will be developing
 programs to help crews and staff better understand and appreciate native american culture and
 people


peru

 despite social unrest and opposition to certain mining projects in the region near constancia we
 maintained constructive relationships with local communities through regular dialogue and
 collaboration on community projects

 once we started transporting concentrate 468 kilometres to the port at matarani we initiated
 communications with about 14 communities along the route our community relations team
 contacted local authorities and community leaders beforehand they also organized community
 meetings where they explained how they would mitigate issues like dust listened to peoples
 needs and concerns and offered to help these communities access government funds for their
 development projects see the constancia case study to learn more

 with the shift from construction to operations constancias relationships with its communities are
 evolving and we have begun to look at the longterm role we can play in tackling poverty we
 expect to become more involved in helping build business capacity by training entrepreneurs to
 market and sell their goods

 there were 57 complaints or concerns registered through the site grievance mechanism in 2015
 of these 89 related to local supply chain issues mainly pertaining to vehicle maintenance
 expenses and payments for services and pending payments by thirdparty suppliers 5 related to
 labour practices and 6 related to human rights and environmental issues and compliance

social impact
resettlement
and land use
mining activities require land which sometimes competes with land used for livelihoods households
and communities recognizing the concerns of local people and the risks to our business we explore
alternatives to minimize disturbances and implement measures to protect human rights and cultural
heritage in every region where we wish to mine

resettlement  when it became clear that the development of constancia would require the
displacement of 36 families from chilloroya we established a resettlement negotiation process that
adhered to international standards for fairness and transparency including the ifc performance
standards and committed to providing equal or better housing with improvements like better
access to water and roads the guiding principle for the process was collaboration  with community
leaders and government authorities as well as affected individuals

all but two of the resettlements were completed in 2014 as part of our agreements we have
continued to help the affected families get settled and will do so until 2016 agreements with the
two remaining families were reached in 2015 and they have relocated

smallscale mining  smallscale informal mining occurs in the pampacancha area of our constancia
mineral claims hudbay peru and the community implemented a fiveyear agreement that allows
mining by a community enterprise provided that it is restricted to the one area and is brought into
legal compliance the agreement which helped formalize the activity there and reduce the risk of
conflict expired in june 2015 and we have begun negotiations to renew it

cultural heritage sites  peru is a country rich in archeological heritage before construction started
we conducted a study to find any archeological sites on the property and obtained a certificate of
nonexistence of archeological remains the site has an archeological monitoring plan amp to
preserve cultural heritage and protect any archeological artifacts that may be found as part of the
plan we have marked protected areas have erected signage and continue to recover new artifacts
we also hold weekly cultural heritage and awareness training for project workers and community
members the amp is regularly audited by the ministry of culture and all of our activities to date
have received government approval

the rosemont environmental impact statement eis recognizes the potential impact of mine
operations on historic properties and traditional uses and perceptions of the land for the many
communities who have used it over the past centuries ancestral human remains and sacred sites are
known to exist in the project area as are traditional resource collecting areas the usda forest

environment
land and biodiversity
at every stage of the mining lifecycle we strive to understand and actively manage our impacts on
biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services our efforts help to minimize our environmental
footprint and related social and environmental risks and strengthen hudbays reputation and
relationships

while each site develops its own management plans specific to its unique location they are all
expected to apply the biodiversity mitigation hierarchy throughout the mining lifecycle in
accordance with our corporate biodiversity conservation standard the mitigation hierarchy is a
widely accepted set of prioritized steps to alleviate environmental harm as far as possible first
through avoidance of detrimental impacts to biodiversity and then through mitigation or reduction
of these impacts and restoration of the areas ecosystem biodiversity offsetting is only considered
as a last resort


manitoba

in manitoba land and biodiversity are managed in line with actual operational activities once the
activities and associated risks are defined during the year annual biodiversity objectives and plans
are set and implemented within the context of longterm environmental goals

the manitoba business unit plan includes an ongoing commitment to boreal woodland caribou
conservation financially supporting manitoba conservations caribou research and implementing
manitoba conservations postcard system for caribou sightings to aid in its research boreal
woodland caribou are currently listed as threatened under the federal species at risk act and
manitobas endangered species and ecosystems act we took specific measures in the design and
construction of the reed mine to reduce and mitigate any potential operational impacts on caribou
which are known to spend most of their time on the west side of reed lake 25 kilometres from the
mine site with a highway and forest in between

peru

in peru we are committed to ensuring there is no net loss of biodiversity as a result of our activities
we have developed a biodiversity action plan bap in keeping with international standards towards
sustainable mining and ifc for protecting and conserving biodiversity to date the bap has involved
a series of mitigation plans including

  floral species management plan  protected plant species are being managed and monitored we
  transplant plants to temporary nursery areas and conduct various germination propagation and
  conditioning tests

  revegetation programs  we plant native seeds and seedlings in degraded areas near the site and
  as part of our progressive reclamation activities the seedlings are grown by community members
  in the hudbay nursery

  rescue and relocation plan  after rescuing captive breeding and relocating species listed as
  threatened including reptiles and aquatic frogs to similar areas offsite we are now focused on
  monitoring how well the animals are adapting to their new habitat the work is done in
  partnership with neighbouring communities

  wetlands management plan  working with community users we are undertaking measures to
  promote the conservation andor restoration of wetlands and very wet grasslands near the site


arizona

over the past six years the arizona team has carried out extensive environmental baseline studies
and ongoing monitoring in the rosemont project area the data collected has been used in
consultation with stakeholders and regulators to develop effective management plans and
incorporate environmental considerations into project design so as to minimize potential impacts on
the biodiversity of the area

to conserve water resources and biodiversity we established the rosemont copper conservation
lands program which includes mitigation proposed in the permitting process as well as additional
areas that hudbay has set aside for conservation purposes under this initiative hudbay arizona will
permanently conserve more than 4827 acres of open land and allocate more than 19 billion gallons
per year of private surface water rights to the public once finalized this program will establish
secure sustainable habitat for bats birds fish frogs and other animals including some endangered
species

arizona is home to many prominent astronomical observatories that need full darkness for their
research and the state has a number of dark skies ordinances intended to minimize light pollution
we are working with suppliers to develop modified lighting systems and technologies at our facilities

and on our equipment that will reduce potential impacts far below what the code requires while
meeting the operational safety requirements set by the federal mine safety and health
administration

rosemont also has cowboys on its payroll who tend cattle on the property cattle ranching is a
traditional land use in the area and the cattle help maintain ecosystem function and provide a buffer
around the proposed mine once mining is finished the area will revert back to ranchland


2015 performance highlights


corporate

  we finalized our corporate biodiversity conservation standard which sets out the minimum
  requirements for identifying environmental conditions and managing biodiversity conservation
  and ecosystem services at each site the standard is consistent with hudbays commitment to
  implement the towards sustainable mining biodiversity conservation management framework
  and protocol

  quality sampling as well as ephemeral system measurements meteorological monitoring
  groundwater model updates review and analysis of possible impacts on surface water and
  dependent species and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi measurements of riparian
  areas

  in late 2015 a draft of a second biological opinion was published by the us fish and wildlife
  service based on additional information on new species to ensure that proper measures are taken
  at the mine to prevent any negative impacts on endangered species it is expected that this
  document will be finished by mid2016

 implementation of the constancia biodiversity action plan was assessed against both the ifc
 mitigation hierarchy and the towards sustainable mining tsm standard the tsm assessment
 gave it a b level rating and recommended actions needed to bring it to an a level all of which will
 be implemented in 2016

 we implemented a native grass seed collection program in which community members are paid for
 the seeds they provide which amounted to 2180 kilograms in 2015 these seeds along with
 native flora seedlings grown in our nursery were used in progressive reclamation activities in the

environment
energy use and
greenhouse gas
as users of fossil fuels to extract and transport ore and electricity to run processing plants hudbay
operations track energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas ghg emissions we strive to
reduce our impact by minimizing energy use and where possible reducing the carbon intensity of
our operations

in manitoba we set annual energy and ghg reduction objectives which we strive to achieve through
energy savings and continuous improvement projects we also closely monitor the regulatory climate
to guide our actions

with constancia and rosemont still in the early stages of the mining lifecycle the sites are just
beginning to develop energy management plans there is however a demonstration solar power
site at the rosemont field office that generates credits under the tucson electric power program
we are testing various solar technologies to determine their viability for our future use and to
provide feedback to the technology providers

constancia coming into production at the start of 2015 has impacted hudbays overall energy and
ghg profile in several ways

  our production of metal in concentrate more than doubled and the substantial energy going into
  construction activities in peru in 2014 has been replaced by energy going to operations thereby
  substantially reducing overall energy intensity per tonne of contained metal in concentrate

  at the same time electricity consumption has increased to power the constancia process plant
  and electricity in peru has a much higher emission factor than the hydrogenerated electricity in
  manitoba thereby substantially increasing the indirect ghg emissions and increasing overall ghg
  intensity per tonne of contained metal

  ghg emissions related to direct energy have also increased per unit of energy since in manitoba
  approximately 50 of direct energy consumption is from combustion of propane while all the
  direct energy consumption in peru is from diesel combustion which has a much higher emission
  factor than propane

2015 performance highlights


manitoba

 total energy usage declined by 29 from 2014 with incremental improvements throughout the
 operations energy intensity which is a measure of energy used per tonne of metal produced was
 down by 41 from 2014


peru

 with the rise in copper production energy consumption and ghg emissions also increased the
 site achieved steadystate operation in august 2015 which will enable us to establish a ghg
 baseline from which we can develop reduction targets

 approximately 67 of ghg emissions are indirect emissions associated with the purchase of
 electricity from the peruvian electrical network while the remainder are directly related to fuel
 consumption at the site


arizona

 we have started developing a rosemont energy management plan as mitigation measures for
 ghg emissions are part of the permitting process among the proposed measures the site design
 will minimize energy requirements and related emissions for example through the use of
 topography to minimize pumping currently enough solar energy is generated onsite to power
 the administration building

environment
air
air quality in and around our sites is important we monitor and report air emissions to comply with
air quality laws and regulations in the countries where we operate

air emissions from our manitoba operations are minor and related to vent and fugitive dust
emissions we have a particulate monitoring program in place to ensure that particulates which may
contain metals remain below regulatory limits readings are reviewed by the government and
external compliance auditors

each year a dust management plan is implemented at flin flon in line with the annual tailings
deposition plan and weather conditions water cover on tailings areas is controlled to reduce the
potential for dust generation we use a variety of methods for dust control on active tailings dams
such as creating covers of calcium chloride sand adding chemical binder on exposed beaches as well
as utilizing a straw covering where possible to minimize dust generation from vehicles we have
paved about 50 of the main inplant roads road dust calculations for the year were higher than in
2014 due to a reassessment of applicable roadways

we have a dust management plan at constancia which includes the application of a dust
suppressant on roads in and around the site we apply water to temporary and haul roads when dust
suppressant cannot be used other measures include changing blasting schedules according to wind
conditions to minimize dust in nearby communities

in its environmental impact statement rosemont has committed to using numerous mitigation
measures to minimize air emissions including operational and engineering controls for controlling
fugitive dust associated with tailings paving roads within the mine site using covers to control
emissions from mix tanks and settlers using spray or physical enclosures for lowemissionpotential
processes using natural gaspowered buses and including stockpile and loadout areas within the
enclosed stockpile building


2015 performance highlights

environment
water
astute water management is an essential component of hudbays growth strategy and operations
our success depends on designing waterefficient operations and continuously monitoring our
consumption and discharge while always maintaining our commitments to local users and regulatory
agencies within the jurisdictions where we operate

each of our sites  and each community in which we operate  has different water needs and
challenges depending on the supply demand and water quality within the watershed

prior to developing a project we assess water quality and availability as part of our feasibility and
environmental impact studies these assessments also consider the water needs of local
communities mining site designs and management plans incorporate water considerations
throughout the entire mine lifecycle our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal
state provincial and local authorities and we expect to comply with all applicable laws and
regulations our commitment to the iso 14001 management standard requires us to pursue
continuous improvement in water management and periodically update our waterrelated risk
assessments

we committed under our environment and social impact assessment esia at constancia to limit
the amount of sediment discharged to the nearby huayllachane soropata and chilloroya rivers to
address issues during the rainy season we have put in place a robust sediment management plan
and installed structures designed to last for the life of the mine controls include barriers like check
dams and silt fences and structures for diverting water to collection and sedimentation ponds as a
final control the water is treated before being released to the water bodies

at constancia we also have a joint environmental monitoring committee of community members
government authorities and company representatives that monitors impacts resulting from the site
we provide committee members with technical training and support an important part of the
committees mandate is to track and record surface water quality and flows and groundwater
quality and levels

in manitoba water usage is managed through water rights licences and related reporting as well as
annual objectives to reduce the use of fresh water discharge is managed at specified discharge
points using sitespecific water treatment technologies and extensive water quality monitoring the
environment department tracks water quality data and reports to management on an exception
basis

in arizona hudbay plans to implement technologies such as drystack tailings to minimize water
use we also plan to replace all groundwater pumped with replacement surface waters from the
central arizona project cap our team conducted extensive baseline studies of surface and
groundwater conditions in the project area and has incorporated considerations of these conditions
into the development of the design as well as future management and mitigation plans for
rosemont

2015 performance highlights


corporate

  hudbay had no material nonconformances relating to discharges into water in 2015 none of the
  effluents discharged from hudbay operations have a significant impact on the receiving streams or
  water bodies in which they are discharged stringent regulatory requirements must be met at the
  point of effluent discharge


manitoba

  total fresh water consumption rose by 09 due to increased production at the lalor mine and
  stall lake mill which more than offset reductions at flin flon 1 and reed 28 water usage
  intensity decreased by 78 confirming that we are using water more efficiently


arizona

  rosemont received its clean water act section 401 certification from the arizona department of
  environmental quality which is required before the army corps of engineers can issue a separate
  permit for the project under the federal clean water act

  water impacts were minimal and limited to stormwater runoff from exploration drilling in 2015
  water use was primarily associated with providing drinking water stock watering or water for the
  drilling program the drilling program used a new mud recycling process to minimize the amount
  of water used at each drill which reduced normal water use by an estimated 50 stormwater was
  managed through controls placed on the disturbed areas inspections and samples were taken as
  required and there was only a minimal amount of runoff during the drilling

peru

 commitments for surface and groundwater usage as well as community water supply were
 achieved within the respective conditions

 effluent releases made in early 2015 from the main sediment pond and noncontinuous releases

environment
waste and
tailings
all hudbay operations have waste management plans to reduce reuse recycle and responsibly
dispose of waste waste rock from our mines and tailings from processing plants are a particular
priority

waste rock is the mined rock that does not have economic value it is managed onsite according to
strict and detailed environmental regulations and industry standards wherever possible it is reused
as fill in underground operations and site rehabilitation

tailings are the finely ground rock trace metals and process chemicals remaining after ore has been
processed hudbay adheres to the mining association of canadas highly regarded tsm protocol for
managing tailings where water is plentiful tailings have historically been piped into secure
engineered impoundments contained by tailings dams tsm guidelines address best practices for the
location design construction operation and closure of tailings facilities so that structures are stable
and comply with industry and government standards and solids and water are properly managed
independent reviews are conducted on our tailings management design and practices in
saskatchewan and manitoba and at constancia in accordance with the tsm protocol

safety measures used at our flin flon tailings impoundment system fftis and constancia tailings
management facility tmf include the following

  frequent inspections by trained hudbay personnel

  comprehensive inspections by thirdparty geotechnical engineering consultants

  deposition plans produced by thirdparty engineering consultants to manage projected tailings
  production

  detailed geotechnical designs for annual construction on the dams completed or validated by
  thirdparty consultants and approved by regulators

  an independent quality assurancecontrol monitoring program is in place during dam construction

  upon completion of construction detailed asbuilt engineering drawings are produced by the
  geotechnical engineering consultant validated and submitted to regulators where required

in consideration of the environmental conditions in arizona rosemont plans to construct a state
oftheart drystack tailings facility which would use significantly less water than traditional facilities
allow for better dust control be significantly more stable and reduce the potential of environmental
impacts to groundwater the use of drystack tailings will also allow more effective and earlier
rehabilitation of the tailings area


2015 performance highlights


corporate

  hudbay manages tailings in accordance with the tsm tailings management protocol and guidance
  documents the protocol and documents were recently reviewed by an independent task force
  and 29 recommendations were brought forward we are participating in macs work to determine
  how the recommendations will be implemented and how they will affect us


manitoba

  we conducted a community information campaign as part of the environmental assessment
  process for a planned expansion of the anderson tailings impoundment area tia to
  accommodate tailings through the life of the lalor mine the new infrastructure will include
  additional water retention dams a seepage collection system and associated pump houses and a
  new spillway to replace the existing one we must submit an environmental assessment ea to
  manitoba conservation and water stewardship for approval before work can begin the ea
  addresses all physical aquatic terrestrial and socioeconomic factors related to the expansion


peru

  construction of the constancia tailings management facility tmf advanced far enough to permit
  the storage of the required water inventory for the start of operations and the deposition of
  tailings in the east tmf impoundment construction of east and west embankments will be a
  feature of ongoing constancia operations during the life of the mine tailings pumping and
  deposition facilities performed as designed during early production

  in 2015 we commissioned a thirdparty engineering consulting firm to conduct a geochemical
  study of waste deposition the firms recommendations which were subsequently implemented
  were to place nonacid generating material in the exterior boundary to minimize the potential for
  acid rock drainage

environment
closure and reclamation
all mines have finite lives and all hudbay mines and development projects have closure plans that
are supported by financial provisions once mining is finished we aim to leave behind land that will
support productive uses for future generations

as a member company of the mining association of canada hudbay has committed its new projects
and operations to management of mine closure in accordance with the tsm framework on mine
closure the framework consists of eight key elements ranging from effective and sustainable
closure planning to consultation with communities continuous improvement and monitoring of
reclamation programs as part of this commitment hudbay identifies opportunities to help
communities plan for sustaining economic development and incorporates community issues into
longterm closure considerations

in addition to the tsm framework hudbays mine closure planning in peru is guided by ifc
performance standards as well as by peruvian mine closure regulations in all jurisdictions in which
hudbay operates mining companies are required to plan for closure before the start of operations
and to provide financial assurance to relevant regulatory agencies for proposed mine reclamation
activities

over the course of our history we have closed many mine sites including some in environmentally
sensitive areas in the process we have developed core competencies in mine closure and
reclamation our practices include the following

designing for closure from the beginning  by considering closure from the start of new projects
we can incorporate design features like buildings that can be easily dismantled to minimize both
our impact on the environment during and after operations and our costs of closure

progressive rehabilitation  by progressively reclaiming areas once they are no longer needed for
mining activities operations are able to start reclamation sooner and reduce the work to be done
when the mine closes we have an ongoing rehabilitation program at flin flon aimed at restoring
the environment in and around the complex and enhancing the visual surroundings activities include
the removal of old structures and equipment the reconfiguring and revegetating of tailings sites and
the greening of spaces between the community and the operations

closed mines  hudbays closed mine site activities are tailored to the applicable jurisdictional
regulatory requirements and the specific and unique characteristics of each site closed mine site
activities can include monitoring activities and adaptive management strategies to ensure the
effectiveness of the reclamation activities until such time as reclamation objectives are determined
in consultation with regulators to be complete


2015 performance highlights


peru

  progressive rehabilitation activities at constancia included the closure of two redundant waste
  rock facilities and other smaller areas used during construction runoff water and native seeds
  were used in the reclamation

  constancias closure plan was updated to incorporate recent studies and technological changes
  that will reduce costs and financial guarantees that hudbay must provide annually to the peruvian
  government the updated plan was submitted in 2015 and approved by the ministry of energy and
  mines in june


manitoba

  progressive rehabilitation activities performed in flin flon included tailings covering seed planting
  and weed control on surrounding property


arizona

  rosemont supports studies by the university of arizonas department of natural resources on
  reclamation techniques procedures and the appropriate vegetation to use these studies are
  systematic and sequential starting with a study of the existing vegetation moving into
  greenhouse studies and continuing on to field tests at the rosemont site the results will guide
  the reclamation techniques that will be used and how plants will be managed we collect data
  from the six reference plots and have had good success so far on seed mixtures and types of cover
  the usda forest service will evaluate the reference areas before issuing its final permit

performance data
basis of reporting
all financial information is presented in us dollars except where otherwise indicated all operating
data is reported using the metric system some metrics are reported on both an absolute basis and
an intensity basis against kilotonnes of metal processed safety data frequency rates are measured
per 200000 hours worked

data measurement techniques
data is measured or estimated and operations are asked to explain significant deviations in
yearoveryear trends the performance data is reported at a mix of operational and corporate levels
data is checked and approved at the site level and also reviewed for consistency by the corporate
data collection team

we provide safety and environmental incident definitions so that all operations report incidents
consistently we calculate greenhouse gas ghg emissions using published factors for emissions

most of the performance data for water and energy is metered we purchase most of our electricity
from local grids utility grid statistics are therefore used to compile purchased electricityrelated
ghg numbers we generate electricity at some of our project sites such as constancia and reed and
this energy is reflected in fuel consumption while ghg numbers are calculated based on conversion
factors

data for the indicators is collected and compiled using information submitted by each site on a
standard template we provide instruction and criteria for gri g4 and towards sustainable mining
tsm and also supply a ghg emissions worksheet developed by the mining association of canada

1 an employee in manitoba filed a harassment complaint against a coworker hudbay and the mines inspector investigated and the complaint was not
  substantiated the complainant subsequently filed a human rights complaint and it is still going through the process this number may be revised
  pending the outcome of that process

2 same numbers as last year because this is a multiyear process these are the same 36 households150 people as we reported last year some were
  resettled during the 2014 calendar year some during the 2015 calendar year

3 added to reflect g4 reporting guidelines so4 was not broken down into these subsections in reporting years prior to 2014 therefore data for the
  two previous years is not available nav

4 governance bodies board of directors are only in toronto canada and therefore other regions were excluded

5 our largest employeebased location did not provide details so this information applies only to peru and arizona

6 this line is the formal complaints from communities allows transparency of concerns raised which are outside of the definition of grievance

7 filed through a community grievance process does not include grievances covered under a collective bargaining agreement

8 three extra because tl chisel and britannia mbu are closed but infrastructure continues to be used at these sites

9 over 100 because there are three additional closure plans for nonoperating sites at our manitoba business unit where infrastructure continues to
  be used
