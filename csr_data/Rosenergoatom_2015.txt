initially the b320 reactor project was designed for heat
capacity of 3250 mw however elektrosila po supplied
already developed structure of electric generator with
electrical capacity of 1000 mw that is why based
on power efficiency of the entire turbogenerator unit the
heat capacity of vver1000 reactor is 3000 mw
